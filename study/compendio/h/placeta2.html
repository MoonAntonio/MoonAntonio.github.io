<p>Unlike most other games, most of the places in FFTA2 have very little bearing on what happens in them. Locations of missions seem to be chosen more or less at random. Unless otherwise indicated, the description of each place is simply that provided by the game. In fact many of the "challenge" type missions take place somewhere but don't even use that location's battle map. Each area has several locations inside it, usually including one named after the area.
<dl>

<dt>Aisenfield</dt>
<dd>The legend of the Thirteen was born long ago on this sweeping plain that time forgot.
<ul><li><i>Aisenfield</i>: This peaceful green field unfolds as far as the eye can see, a sight unchanging through the ages.
</li><li><i>Nazan Highroad</i>: This road leads northeast to the Nazan Mines. Few pass this way since they closed.
</li><li><i>Tramdine Trail</i>: This trail leads north to Tramdine Fens. Chocobos that take fright easily make for ill mounts in the bleak swampland ahead.
</li><li><i>Fluorgis Highroad</i>: This road leads northwest to Fluorgis. Bards can often be heard reciting their latest verses, refining them as they approach the city.
</li><li><i>Neslowe Highroad</i>: This road leads to the Neslowe Passage. The bridge here spanning the narrow sea is only open by day.
</li><li><i>Kthili Highroad</i>: This road leads east to Kthili Sands. At this distance the great desert dunes seem only hills.
</li><li><i>Field of the Fallen</i>: Grass sways in undulating waves across the verdant expanse. The Thirteen are said to have fought a great battle here.
</li><li><i>The Ligress Headland</i>: Warm winds sweep across this rocky highland. Below, the Mirhelian Sea stretches to the horizon.
</li><li><i>Gaol's March</i>: This road was built to honor the hero Gaol, one of the Thirteen Knights of Aisen.
</li></ul>
<p></dd>
<dt>Aldanna Range</dt>
<dd>Rugged highland with row upon row of soaring peaks. Hardy mountain shrubs grow among its crags and clefts.
<ul><li><i>The Aldanna Range</i>: Icy winds and magicked Mist swirl through these mountain peaks. Many fierce beasts make their home among the rocky crags.
</li><li><i>Zedlei Highroad</i>: This road leads north to Zedlei Forest. Travelers' feet move with hushed whispers through the soft carpet of fallen leaves.
</li><li><i>Baptiste Highroad</i>: This road leads east to Baptiste Hill. There is little vegetation to break the monotony of the desolate trail.
</li><li><i>Galerria Highroad</i>: This road leads to the caves of the Galerria Deep. Footing is tracherous on the dark, uneven path.
</li><li><i>Lezaford's Cottage</i>: This old cottage is nestled deep in the mountains. The trail leading here bears little sign of traffic.
<br>You can rest here to turn time forward by one or more months. Later you can also reach Zellea from here.
</li><li><i>Orchise Snowfields</i>: The ground here is dusted white with snow, broken only by the occasional track of some unseen animal.
</li><li><i>Whitesnow Pass</i>: This frozen pass lies under a perpetual blanket of snow that shines a ghostly silver in the moonlight.
</li><li><i>Redclay Pass</i>: The smooth clay along this trail can be perilously slipper. Occasionally, a thin Mist hangs in the air.
</li></ul>
<p></dd>
<dt>Baptiste Hill</dt>
<dd>Green grasses cover the gently sloping hillside. A refreshing wind eases the burdens of passing travelers.
<ul><li><i>Baptiste Hill</i>: Lush grasses carpet the hillside. Caravans mark the progress of their journey as they pass the solitary tree.
</li><li><i>Aldanna Highroad</i>: This road leads west to the Aldanna Range. The loose soil littering the path slows even the most sure-footed of wayfarers.
</li><li><i>Bigsa Highroad</i>: This road leads southwest to the Bigsa Greenlands. The way is rough, making progress slow even on foot.
</li><li><i>Camoa Highroad</i>: This road leads south towards Camoa, gradually widening as it nears the city.
</li><li><i>Zedlei Highroad</i>: This road follows the coast north to Zedlei Forest. Mounds of green underbrush rise along the verge.
</li><li><i>Sun-dappled Trail</i>: Sunlight dances through breaks in the canopy covering this woodland trail. Clumps of mushrooms sprout in the shade.
</li><li><i>The Boulderfall</i>: The many rocks jutting from this low-lying mountain make it a popular proving ground for adventurers with more lofty ambitions.
</li><li><i>Flutegrass Bluff</i>: A cool breeze blows in from the coast. On clear days it's possible to make out the continent across the narrow sea.
</li></ul>
<p></dd>
<dt>Bigsa Greenlands</dt>
<dd>Thick vegetation grows across this broad plain. Many travelers pass along its extensive network of roads.
<ul><li><i>Camoa Highroad</i>: This road leads east to Camoa. Passing storms often leave the road rutted and cut across with pools of water.
</li><li><i>Graszton Highroad</i>: This busy road leads south to Graszton. Even late at night the steady stream of travelers does not abate.
</li><li><i>Galerria Highroad</i>: This road leads west to the caves of the Galerria Deep. Even here, the ground is cold and damp.
</li><li><i>Baptiste Highroad</i>: This road leads north to Baptiste Hill. The greater part of the travelers here can be seen astride chocobos.
</li><li><i>The Bigsa Greenlands</i>: Bright, open fields stretch to the horizon. As the sun falls, monsters creep out of the rising gloom.
</li><li><i>Vieg Northroad</i>: The Vieg Highroad is one of the region's busiest corridors. It is not uncommon to find stalls and tents offering sundry goods to passersby.
</li><li><i>Caravan Trail</i>: A trail cut into the side of a steep cliff. Travelers on chocoboback carefully pick their way along the incline.
</li><li><i>Jadewood</i>: Tall trees blot out the light in the deep recesses of this forest. The air is heavy with moisture from hidden pools and lush greenery.
</li></ul>
<p></dd>
<dt>Camoa</dt>
<dd>Camoa is a famed gathering spot for adventurers. The countryside surrounding the city is a verdant patchwork of crops and pastureland.
<ul><li><i>Camoa</i>: This ancient city has long been a favorite gathering spot for adventurers. Throngs of people bustle along its streets.
</li><li><i>Bigsa Highroad</i>: This road leads west to the Bigsa Greenlands. A sea of emerald grass glimmers on either side.
</li><li><i>Baptiste Highroad</i>: This road climbs gradually north toward Baptiste Hill.
</li><li><i>Adventurer's Rest</i>: Soft breezes caress this gently rolling grassland. An idyllic resting spot for the footsore adventurer.
</li><li><i>Shaug Tablelands</i>: This high plateau offers a spendid view of Camoa. Take care should the weather turn foul: the paths here can be treacherous in the rain.
</li><li><i>Dias Plain</i>: Narrow paths crisscross this airy plain. The sun-weary traveler will find welcome shelter in the cool shade of the trees.
</li><li><i>Tulque Grove</i>: Faeries are said to gather beneath the trees of this secluded grove. The sound of rustling leaves is borne upon the breeze.
<br>Not initially available
</li></ul>
<p></dd>
<dt>Fluorgis</dt>
<dd>Quaint shops and age-old houses line the streets of Fluorgis. Beyond the city, ruins of once mighty fortresses stand watch over the wilderness.
<ul><li><i>Fluorgis</i>: Filled with fountains and greenery, the lively city of Fluorgis thrives as a hub of air trade.
</li><li><i>Sant D'alsa Highroad</i>: This road leads to Sant D'alsa Bluff. Airship after airship pass by overhead, receding noiselessly into the distance.
</li><li><i>Aisenfield Highroad</i>: This road leads southeast to Aisenfield. Who can count the songs sung of heroes who set out along this very highway?
</li><li><i>Tramdine Trail</i>: This road leads east into Tramdine Fens. These days its traffic numbers more beasts than men.
</li><li><i>Fluorgis Aerodrome</i>: Ivalice's first aerodrome, built soon after the invention of the airship. It's a gateway for all manner of goods from throughout Ivalice.
</li><li><i>Diegnot Fortress</i>: Not far to the north of Fluorgis lies Diegnot Fortress. Her once proud walls have long since crumbled into ruin.
</li><li><i>Cannol West Barbican</i>: The western gate of Cannol Keep. They said none could breach its massive doors, and indeed, it stood fast even as the keep proper fell.
</li><li><i>Cannol Keep</i>: Named after the famed gria general, the ruins of this holdfast are the grandest for many leagues.
<br>Note: The Luck-stick Sellers show up here.
</li></ul>
<p></dd>
<dt>Galerria Deep</dt>
<dd>Countless tunnels make up this vast underground cavern. It's known in some circles as the Pit of the Larva.
<ul><li><i>The Galerria Deep</i>: Chill wind swirls in the cavern, its howl echoing ceaselessly through the lightless depths.
</li><li><i>Bigsa Highroad</i>: This road leads east to the Bigsa Greenlands. Snow and mud mix to form a nearly impassable mire.
</li><li><i>Aldanna Highroad</i>: This road leads northeast to the Aldanna Range. At night the damp ground freezes solid.
</li><li><i>Rupie Highroad</i>: This road leads north to the Rupie Mountains. Snow falls year-round along this icy trail.
</li><li><i>Windwrit Tundra</i>: A silence hangs over the frozen ground. Not even the beasts of the wild dare break the stillness here.
</li><li><i>Larva Den</i>: Something has dug a large, conical pit in the floor of the cave. The earth at the bottom seems to write and shift...
</li><li><i>Sealed Reach</i>: Water trickles down the rough stone of the cavern walls. The living rock at its base is smooth and slick.
</li></ul>
<p></dd>
<dt>Goug</dt>
<dd>This island rising from the Mirhelian Sea is home to the moogle city of Goug.
<ul><li><i>Goug</i>: This moogle city is the birthplace of tecknologies found throughout Ivalice. Odd machineries perch on every shelf and peer out from every corner.
</li><li><i>Kthili Highroad</i>: This road leads north to Kthili Sands. A great iron drawbridge connects the island with the mainland.
</li><li><i>Neslowe Highroad</i>: This majestic bridge leads west to the Neslowe Passage. Its solid construction shrugs off storm and tide with ease.
</li><li><i>Goug Mines</i>: No ordinary mine, this network of tunnels holds machineries found nowhere else. Expeditions are often made in search of these ancient relics.
</li><li><i>Corpolk Field</i>: Few plants grow in the barren soil here. A mountain belches black smoke in the distance.
</li><li><i>Firewyrm Mount</i>: Gouts of flame erupt from the living volcano. They say beasts who breathe flame and scorch the ground they walk live among the char.
<br>Note: This is not immediately accessible; it becomes so after a mission.
</li></ul>
<p></dd>
<dt>Graszton</dt>
<dd>This narrow stretch of land overlooks the Sea of Ewohl. People and goods stream through the busy port city of Graszton.
<ul><li><i>Graszton</i>: Awash with merchants and sailors, this lively port town is an important center for trade and commerce in the region.
</li><li><i>Bigsa Highroad</i>: This road leads north to the Bigsa Greenlands. A group of volunteer watchmen patrols the highway.
</li><li><i>Vieg Southroad</i>: Where there are travelers, there are highwaymen. This road sees its fair share of both.
</li><li><i>Baybold Lowlands</i>: The sound of distant waves can just be heard above the hard wind. Few plants find purchase in the barren soil.
</li><li><i>Shadeholme</i>: This dark, unsettling forest is rumored to serve as a hideout for brigands and thieves.
<br>Not initially available
</li><li><i>Melby Point</i>: Fairies are said to gather in this secluded spot, where white flower petals dance on the wind.
<br>This is where the Brightmoon Tor first appears. Not initially available.
</li></ul>
<p></dd>
<dt>Jylland</dt>
<dd>The general area of Ivalice that FFTA2 takes place in. The continents of Jylland include Ordalia, Loar, and Jagd Zellea.<p></dd>
<dt>Kthili Sands</dt>
<dd>Waves of sand rise and fall in this barren waste. The scorching sun burns bright in the sky.
<ul><li><i>Kthili Sands</i>: By day the sun beats down without mercy. By night freezing winds bite into sun-seared flesh.
</li><li><i>Aisenfield Highroad</i>: This road leads west to Aisenfield. The going is slow, with the fine sand swallowing foot and wheel alike.
</li><li><i>Goug Highroad</i>: This bridge leads south to the city of Goug. Before its construction, boats ferried travelers across the narrow channel.
</li><li><i>The Ochre Wasteland</i>: Images shimmer and blur above these scorching sands, while bone-thin beasts prowl in search of prey.
</li><li><i>Simoon Dunes</i>: ???
<br>Note: This is where the Wizard D'Tidle can remove your clan title.
</li><li><i>Sea of Boiling Flame</i>: Lava flows glowing hot from the volcano's maw, and the air is thick with sulfur. The hellish landscape stretches unbroken into the distance.
<br>Note: This is not immediately accessible; it becomes so after a mission.
</li></ul>
<p></dd>
<dt>Loar</dt>
<dd>The main continent of FFTA2. Areas in Ordalia include: Aldanna Range, Baptiste Hill, Bigsa Greenlands, Camoa, Galerria Deep, Graszton, Moorabella, Ruins of Delgantua, Rupie Mountains, Targ Wood, and Zedlei Forest.<p></dd>
<dt>Moorabella</dt>
<dd>The magick city of Moorabella and its aerodrome sit atop this high, forest-covered plateau.
<ul><li><i>Moorabella</i>: The magick arts are studied and refined here in this quaint town of neatly rowed houses and snow-covered lanes.
</li><li><i>Zedlei Highroad</i>: This road leads east to Zedlei Forest. Wisps of magickal light glow in the night air.
</li><li><i>Rupie Highroad</i>: This road leads southwest to the Rupie Mountains. The bitter cold saps the strength of travelers as they make their ascent.
</li><li><i>Delgantua Highroad</i>: This road leads west into the ruins of Delgantua. Once a major thoroughfare, it's now all but deserted.
</li><li><i>Moorabella Aerodrome</i>: Situated on the outskirts of Moorabella, this airship terminal offers skyferry service to Fluorgis.
</li><li><i>Sage's Grove</i>: Sages often gather to talk alongside the small river that runs through this peaceful wood.
</li><li><i>Dyme Plateau</i>: The sky shines bright blue above this high plain. Snow falls here not by any work of nature, but by the hand of magick.
</li><li><i>Reighlard Forest</i>: The private grounds of the grand duke of Moorabella. The forest has remained largely undisturbed by man.
</li><li><i>The Snowdust</i>: Snow soft and white as cotton falls in this lonely field. A wandering minstrel once called it the Snowdust - now none call it anything else.
</li></ul>
<p></dd>
<dt>Nazan Mines</dt>
<dd>This magicite mine has lain dormant for long years. Only creatures of the dark now crawl its passages.
<ul><li><i>Nazan Mines</i>: This mine once yielded all manner of magicite, but was abandoned when the Gorday vein was struck.
