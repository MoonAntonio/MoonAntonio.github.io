        <dt>Ai Hayakawa </dt>

        <dd>Yu's "big sister" (actually his twin). Ai is a bit of a
        whiner for a twelve-year-old, and tends to provide the
        comic relief in the party. She's innately suspicious of
        most things, and thinks everything in the Inner World is
        weird. She's right, of course (most of it ends up
        embarrassing her at one point or another). Chocobos have a
        fixation on pulling her pigtails. At one point, she meets
        up with Fabra, who gives her Pokepoche as a pet. An
        encounter with Kuria leaves her a good deal more thoughtful
        than earlier. However, both Ai and Yu are a bit more
        complicated than it seems...<br>

        his earlier life... Aura was killed when his world was
        destroyed by Chaos. She turned herself into Soil for Kaze
        to use in his battles. She apparently had a relationship
        with Makenshi.<br>

        <dd>Cute, lovable Cactuar! The Cactuars all live in a
        village in a desert where they try to defeat the "wandering
        ocean" who keeps them from seeing the sun. As you might
        expect, they can shoot needles from their bodies and are
        extremely fast (running without actually moving their
        limbs) - and they hate water. The sound they make is a kind
        of squeak that sounds like "geKA!".<br>

        <dt><b>Chobi</b> </dt>

        <dd>A wacky Chocobo picked up by Yu on his first outing in
        the Inner World. Chobi is full of idiosyncrasies: the
        tendency to grab Ai by her pigtail and run around with her;
        an illogical affinity for the giant, super-spicy Dead
        Peppers, which cause it to breathe fire and run around
        screaming; and the ability to jump at an enemy and kick it
        to bits (just like the Chocobo Kick summon!) He wears
        Isabel, the Inner World clock made by Cid, around his neck;
        it was apparently placed there by Oscha as a tracking
        device. The clock also allows Yu, Ai, and Lisa to
        anticipate when and where the interdimensional subway will
        go next. At one point, he encounters the ancient Ciel
        ruins, which gives him the power to transform into the
        legendary Ciel Chocobo, which can fly. Incidentally, he's
        voiced by the same person as Earl Tyrant.<br>

        She's just as wacky as her sister, and her own conversation
        is "I don't know..." and "or something like that". 8p She's

        <dd>This version's Cid is a cheerful, optimistic, and
        energetic technician, a wizard at anything electronic. He
        carries around weird high-tech equipment and inventions
        wherever he goes (some of them can pack quite a punch!) He
        names his inventions after females and has a way-too-close
        connection with them. He has his own insignia, and wears
        neato specs. He's the brains behind the Comodin. You DON'T
        want to be around him when he gets mad (he pulls all kinds
        of crazy gadgets out of his backpack and gets medieval on
        whosever's ass is around). A rather hilarious episode in
        which he gets turned into a frog ends up with a kiss
        between him and Mireth, and their relationship has been
        rather strained since then.<br>

        himself for destroying everything he touches. Ai tries to

        and friends, and report to whichever of Earl Tyrant's
        minions happens to be around. Her entire vocabulary seems
        to be "kukuruyu", which sounds like a dove's cooing. She's
        not quite mindless, though... in fact, if it weren't for
        her the series would have ended quite differently.

        Chaos (he can transform into a giant winged creature). When
        human, he's constantly eating what his "pastry chefs", the

        anger created by his machinations on our heroes. He
        searches out Omega so that he can recombine it and complete

        by the Inner World, so when he ends up back there he uses
        its energy to (e.g.) grow to giant-size and try to pound
        things. However, the whole thing ends up being a trap by a
        disgruntled Earl Tyrant to finally kill Fungus and his

        <dd>The victim of a tragic past, Kaze has been turned into
        a complete introvert. He barely speaks except when there's
        something he wants (he never replies to anyone). But he's
        not one to get close to - he holds unimaginable power;
        Oscha and Fungus both call him the "Unlimited", the one
        with the power to destroy the gods (hence the title of the
        series). He carries around two weapons; a regular red gun
        which can still destroy most things out there, and a Demon
        Gun attached to his arm. He has a strange relationship with
        it; he variously calls it his "heart" and his "life". It
        uses Soil (the crystals of those killed by Chaos) to
        combine three magical colored bullets into a shoukanjuu
        (Summoned Creature), which then decimates the enemy in
        various ways. Kaze's only goal (and the only thing he shows
        any emotion about) is to obliterate Shroi Kumo, his
        archenemy, who apparently headed the attack on his home
        world. Apparently their first battle created the dark
        tunnel to Tokyo, and ended up with Kaze being put to sleep
        for twelve years. Although Kaze generally ends up saving
        Ai, Yu, and Lisa from some monster, he most definitely
        doesn't actually care about them...with the possible
        exception of Lisa, whom I think reminds him of Aura, a
        woman in his past. He also has an uncanny ability to be
        where they are before they get there, even if it's
        technically impossible for him to do so. I believe he
        follows them around because Earl Tyrant is after them and
        Shroi Kumo works for Earl Tyrant. Oh: and he has a
        perfectly good eye under the patch(actually half a pair of
        sunglasses), a perfectly good arm under the gun, and is
        actually pretty scrawny under the cloak. Image is
        everything. 8p He also has a strange relationship with
        Moogle...<br>

        in the Inner World. In any case, unlike Kaze, Lisa consents
        to travel with the twins and shows a genuine affection for
        them. Lisa controls a unique power called Kigenjutsu
        (Defender of Life), which allows her to harness the energy
        of nature, and she uses it to great effect whenever she
        can, usually to protect Ai and Yu... being careful not to
        overuse it, because doing so would result in her death,
        just like her mother did. However, she's of no use against

        <dd>Kaze's epic archenemy, the Demon Swordsman... although
        he seems to have a reluctance to actually fight Kaze,
        mainly, I think, because he knows they're really on the
        same side. He's also very reticent, but I think it's for
        different reasons... Kaze really just doesn't care about
        people, but Shroi Kumo seems just to be too burdened to say
        anything. I think he's a basically good man, but he works
        for Earl Tyrant because he's been overpowered... and
        possibly because he doesn't have anything else to live for,
        his world having been eaten by Chaos. His attacks all look
        similar: he uses bottles of mist to summon a white dragon,
        using names of music (etude, quartet, symphony, etc.). The
        shade of his brother Madoushi ends up being killed by him,
        and he begins to be disillusioned with Earl Tyrant, even
        after being made a Deathlord of Gaudium. He starts to
        surreptitiously help the Comodin and Ai/Yu/Lisa and

        though). Actually, he does have arms, but they're usually
        absorbed into his body. His face is covered by a white
        mask. The only time I've seen him confront Kaze he used a
        complicated machine as his Monster-Of-The-Day. I've never
        seen him surprised by <i>anything</i>. Oscha has the abilty
        to turn his body into shadow.<br>

        <dd>Look up "slimy bastard" in the dictionary and you'll
        find his portrait. Quite literally. A freaky fish-man with
        a mouth in the back of his head, he rides around in a
        souped-up '50s car with a <i>pool</i> in the middle of it.
        Incorrigibly arrogant, boastful, and unfortunately more
        intelligent than the other three Deathlords living in
        Gaudium. He relies on speed and the analyzing of previously
        obtained data to actually plan out his fights other than
        just going in there and hitting people with monsters like
        Herba or Fungus. His first encounter with Kaze began with
        the keen observation that it takes him about a minute and a
        half to actually fire his gun. 8p Talk about breaking down
        the fourth wall! He's also got a showbiz streak in him, and
        is the mastermind behind the giant Ocean Puzzle. He has an
        incredibly annoying laugh ("shashasha!").<br>

        <dd><i>(Aliases: Pochepoke)</i> A little creature Ai calls
        "scarily cute". She came across it when visiting Fabra's
        oyster-like home. Fabra ended up giving it to her as a pet.
        All it is is a big mouth with sharp teeth and a moustache.
        It has the power to spit out almost anything Ai asks it to,
        but it can also eat anything as well! Ai ends up covering
        it up with masking tape unless she needs it for
        something.<br>

        orchid) whom Lisa confided in as a child. How it got to the
        Inner World and got turned into a human? Please don't ask.

        can read Chobi's thoughts a bit. He tends to be a bit less
