	<dt><b>Antican</b></dt>
	<dd>A race of beastmen that resemble ants. They lived underground, beneath the Galka settlements in Altepa Desert. Being awakened by accident, they drove the Galka out of their homes and forced them to flee to Bastok through Korroloka Tunnel.<br><br></dd>

	<dt><b>Ark Angels</b></dt>
	<dd>Also known as the Crystal Warriors. They were created by Promathia to represent the central vice of each of the five races - the arrogance of the Elvaan, the apathy of the Humes, the envy of the Mithra, the cowardice of the Tarutaru, the rage of the Galka. Kam'lanaut and Eald'narche summoned them to fight for them while they enacted their plan to resurrect the Shadow Lord and open the Gates of Paradise. They were eventually defeated by Lion, Zeid and Aldo.<br><br></dd>

	<dt><b>Armathrwn Society</b></dt>
	<dd>An ancient society of Kuluu. Its members are Kareh'ayollio, Eshan'tarl, Nag'molada, and Mammets. This secret society carries out the will of the duchy.<br><br></dd>

	<dt><b>Aurastery</b></dt>
	<dd>(combination of "aural"="related to sound" and "ministry") One of the 5 Tarutaru ministries of magic. Coordinates the magic education of the Tarutaru. Current minister: Sedal-Godjal. Predecessor: Koru-Moru.<br><br></dd>

	<dt><b>Automaton</b></dt>
	<dd>Mechanical puppets developed by the alchemists of Aht Uhrgan. Highly customizable and controllable from a distance, they are somewhat of an equivalent to Cardians in Windurst. However, as opposed to Cardians, Automatons were initially created for entertainment purposes, even though professional Puppetmasters have since adapted them for combat as well. Empress Jubleel, Nashmeira's mother, has introduced the concept of programming to give Automatons behavioural patterns, thus allowing them to be more independent: a Puppetmaster controlling such an Automaton would no longer need to dictate their every move.<br><br></dd>

	<dt><b>Avatar</b></dt>
	<dd>Summonable gods who protect different aspects of Vana'diel. There are five Terrestrial Avatars: Diabolos, Phoenix, Fenrir, Carbuncle, Bahamut. In addition, there are six Celestial Avatars representing the six basic elements: Shiva, Ifrit, Leviathan, Ramuh, Titan, Garuda. All but Phoenix and Bahamut can be summoned. The Terrestrial Avatars participate in a fierce battle to protect Vana'diel from the spread of the Emptiness in the Chains of Promathia storyline.<br><br></dd>

	<dt><b>Cardian</b></dt>
	<dd>Dolls brought to life by the strange fruit of the trees cultivated within Heavens Tower. They became grunts for work and war, and held loyalty only to Zonpa-Zippa. Eventually, they grew out of control, so Zonpa-Zippa made the Ace Cardians to manage them.<br><br></dd>

	<dt><b>Elvaan</b></dt>
	<dd>The third of the five races of Vana'diel. They have long flattened pointed ears, but are otherwise human-looking. They started as a rather insignificant race, but soon grew to a powerful empire, and formed the Kingdom of San d'Oria on the Quon continent. Elvaan strictly adhere to their code of conduct and their belief in the Dawn Goddess Altana. Their kingdom soon grew to an empire as they took over many lands, until they tried to seize Bastok and Windurst, the homes of the other four races. This caused a great war between the three kingdoms that raged on with bloodbaths on both sides. The San d'Orians fell to Bastok when firearms were used against them. They then fell into civil war for the throne. Today they are a shadow of their former glory.<br><br></dd>

	</dd>

	<dt><b>Dawn Maidens</b></dt>
	<dd>Women of the Zilart with exceptional skill in telepathy and magic were chosen to be Dawn Maidens. They were said to be in direct service to Altana. They soon developed a distaste for the way the Zilart treated the Kuluu and conspired with them to sabotage the Zilart's experiment to open the gates to paradise. They were killed in the resulting Meltdown, but were blessed with "afterlife" to watch over future incarnations of the gatekeeper.<br><br></dd>

	<dt><b>Galka</b></dt>
	<dd>The first of the five races of Vana'diel. As the first created, they still have beastlike traits in their appearance. Galka have a large, powerful body, and brute strength, with a hairy ape like face. There are no female Galka, and thus, they do not reproduce. When Galka reach the last days of life, they return to their homeland in Altepa Desert in order to be reborn as children. This is called the Journey of Rebirth. However, once reborn, they retain no memories of their past. The Galka were the first race to create a peaceful civilization. When they were forced from their homes by the Antica they landed on what would eventually be the town of Bastok. During the San d'Orian imperialism, they formed an alliance with the Humes, built the city of Bastok, and fought back the San d'Orians. As time progressed, the Galka got poorer in the age of technology. They were seen as inferior by the Humes, and a deep resentment has thus developed between the 2 races.<br><br></dd>

	<dt><b>Gigas</b></dt>
	<dd>A secondary race of beastmen who live in the far north islands. They allied with the Kindred and were key players in the initial stages of the Crystal War. They also played a role in the pre-emptive strike on Jeuno, but Kam'lanaut and his armies pushed them back and they retreated to Delkfutt's tower.<br><br></dd>

	<dt><b>Hume</b></dt>
	<dd>The last of the five races of Vana'diel. Humes are human equivalents. They orginated on the southern portion of Quon. With their lack of strong skill in anything, they were mostly ignored by rest of world, until they formed an alliance with Galka during the invasion of San d'Oria and formed Bastok. They eventually grew stronger and more powerful in the age of technology, while Galka didn't. This started to cause resentment on both sides.<br><br></dd>

	<dt><b>Immortals</b></dt>
	<dd>The name given to the elite Blue Mage corps in the service of the Empire of Aht Uhrgan. Blue Mages were first introduced to Aht Uhrgan at the behest of Emperor Balrahn. They are artificially created by infusing a living being with beastman or monster blood, or by transplanting some monster or beastman tissue to them. This gives them a feral quality and allows them to harness the powers of monsters. However, every Blue Mage runs the risk of being overcome by the beastly powers within them. When that happens, they usually transform into Soulflayers. The Immortals are currently led by Raubahn.<br><br></dd>

	<dt><b>Imp</b></dt>
	<dd>A small species of demon native to Aht Uhrgan. They served as messengers in the Shadow Lord's army during the Crystal War. Their exceptionally quick reflexes allow them to be able to see through any disguise. Thus, as they are aggressive on sight, the Invisible spell is ineffective against them.<br><br></dd>

	<dt><b>Kuluu</b></dt>
	<dd>A race of people biologically descended from the Zilart with no natural magic or telepathic powers. They received their magic from avatars, but were condemned by the Zilart as freaks and forced into slavery through amulets created by the Zilart king. These amulets sent the thoughts of the wearer to the "Eye of Altana" for monitoring. As a consequence of the magic explosion known as the Meltdown, most of the Kuluu were turned into Tonberries.<br><br></dd>

	<dt><b>Lamia</b></dt>
	<dd>An artificial race of beastmen resembling snake-like women. Originally a type of biological weapon (or chimera) developed by the alchemists of Aht Uhrgan, which they used to eliminate Ephramadian survivors, some rogue Lamiae have since made their home around Arrapago Reef. They have the ability to bewitch fallen warriors, thus assembling an undead army for themselves. They may attack Aht Uhrgan in the form of the Undead Swarm, the least organized, but, arguably the most dangerous of the beastman forces. Lamiae are led by Medusa and are the only beastman race capable of becoming a Corsair.<br><br></dd>

	<dd>One of the main hostile beastman races in Aht Uhrgan, resembling bipedal chameleons in appearance. They are violent, highly organized and skilled in both melee combat and magic. Their stronghold is situated in the jungle city of Mamook, and they are led by a council of 4 overlords, representing the 4 classes of their society, presided by the Autarch Gulool Ja Ja. Mamool Ja are the only beastman race capable of becoming a Blue Mage.<br><br></dd>

A large group of Mithra has emigrated from their home continent of Olzhyria (situated in the south of Vana'diel) and settled partly on the island of Elshimo (creating the town of Kazham), and partly in Mindartia, alongside the Tarutaru. The two tribes are hostile to each other, and see themselves as exiles from their homeland.<br><br></dd>

The Full Moon Fountain has been used ever since as a way to predict the future of Windurst. The current Star Sibyl is in a difficult position. During the Crystal War, Karaha-Baruha, Windurst's hero, attempted to summon the full power of Fenrir, the guardian of the Full Moon Fountain. This saved Windurst, but at a great cost. The Full Moon Fountain was dimmed, losing its ability to predict the future, leaving the Star Sibyl with no guidance to provide to her fellow citizens. She has been doing her best to provide false prophecies ever since, in the hopes that something might someday restore the power of the Fountain. This is eventually achieved in the Windurst Mission Storyline.<br><br></dd>

Unable to salvage the remains of the first construct, Razfahd works with Ghatsad in order to create a gigantic Automaton, as a new, more powerful body for Alexander to inhabit. Razfahd believes that this will let him control Alexander, defeat Aht Uhrgan's enemies and bring about an age of prosperity. However, Alexander will not let himself be controlled and attempts to kill anyone who doesn't show proper deference to him. He notably kills Nashmeira. Outraged by this, Luzaf allows Odin to take control of him in order to face Alexander. Since the confrontation of the two deities would lead to Ragnarok�essentially, the destruction of the world�Razfahd realizes his mistake and sacrifices himself, somehow managing to stop Alexander.<br><br></dd>

Originally, she created the Zilart as the only race on Vana'diel, but they attempted to open the Gates of Paradise, which resulted in their destruction. In her sorrow, Altana shed tears upon Vana'diel, five of which created the five civilized races. She also split the Mothercrystal into five shards, in an attempt to stall the spread of the Emptiness. At the end of the Chains of Promathia storyline, she effectively reiterates her act of creation by shedding a tear of blessing for each of the protagonists of the story, who, coincidentally, happen to be representatives of each of the five races.<br><br></dd>

Aphmau is a necessary cover, which has been devised in order to protect Nashmeira, as she is still very young. When she hears the rumours about the Black Coffin, her curiosity gets the better of her, and she decides to get to the bottom of the business on her own. Luzaf kidnaps Ovjang, intent on studying its mechanisms in case they could be useful to his ends, but Aphmau follows suit and ends up being a �voluntary' captive on the Black Coffin. The encounter gives her new perspectives on both her duties as a ruler and the painful history of her motherland. Unlikely feelings develop between her and Luzaf, and, together, they endeavour to challenge the plans of her brother, Razfahd, as well as Luzaf's pact with Odin. Killed by Alexander during the battle, Aphmau is brought back to life by Luzaf, who offers his own life to Odin in exchange. This experience allows her to find the courage to be the Empress that Aht Uhrgan needs, and she is formally re-crowned in celebration of Alexander's defeat.<br><br></dd>

He originally made his fortune from studying ancient Zilart technology and using it in his inventions. When he found a mysterious crystal in the Northlands, he ordered the ill-fated Northland expedition there to see if there was more. This piece actually turned out to be a chunk of the Star of Tavnazia. Using the knowledge he gained from his studies, he developed a crystal engine that would eventually power airships. During their development, he worked with figures in hooded robes that may have been Zilart. The Archduke of Jeuno commissioned him to build a fleet of airships to be used in the Crystal War, but only one was ever publicly used or needed.<br><br></dd>

However, this proved too much for both of them. Fenrir's lifeforce waned, while Karaha-Baruha's was split into two. Part of it incarnated itself within Fenrir. It reappeared alongside him just once to defend the city. The other part lived on inside Joker. This also had the consequence of dimming the Full Moon Fountain, which no longer foretold the future. Thus, the Star Sibyl had to invent her prophecies, unable to truly see what fate was in store for her country. In the Windurst Mission Storyline, Fenrir's lifeforce is restored.

Once again, undaunted by his demonic appearance, she smiled at him without a word of reproach. Upon seeing this, Frit prayed to Altana to exchange his life for hers. His wish was granted, but Altana soon saw that Falbub was unhappy on her own. She thus took both her and Frit to the heavens, rewarding the general's repentance and the girl's devotion. In the legends that were born of this story, Frit was renamed I'Frit (Frit of the Flames). Falbub is the name of the brightest, red-coloured star of the Ifrit constellation.

He wanted to apologize to Leviathan and try to discuss with him. However, his first mate was too eager to fight and attacked the sea serpent before the order was given. Forced to defend his men, Veydal offered his life to Leviathan in return for theirs. He was last seen falling into the sea in fierce combat with the serpent. Upon returning home, Veydal's first mate claimed the victory as his own. However, the next day, Leviathan's body washed ashore, with Veydal's sword planted in his skull. The serpent wished to honour the memory of the brave warrior and show the truth to his kinsmen, in a dying effort. Altana, moved by Leviathan's gesture and Veydal's courage, called them both to the heavens. She transformed Leviathan into the Celestial Avatar of Water. Veydal is the name of the brightest, dark-blue coloured star of the Leviathan constellation. (See also <a href="espmon/leviathan.html">Summon:Leviathan</a>)<br><br></dd>

They managed to hold their own for a while, but an imperial ambush (using Lamiae) destroyed their ships. As he was drowning, Luzaf made a pact with Odin, the sovereign deity of Ephramad, asking for revenge. 200 years later, sensing the imminent awakening of Alexander, Odin brings Luzaf and his crew back to life. Luzaf is destined to become Odin's embodiment once his revenge has been carried out. This entails giving his body up for Odin's use and losing his personality. But meeting Aphmau changes his outlook. Ignorant of her identity at first, he is reluctant to kill her once he does find out. She convinces him that she is not responsible for the sins of her forefathers and encourages him to attempt to rebuild his nation rather than destroy Aht Uhrgan. However, that means breaking his pact with Odin, which, for the latter is out of the question. In the end, Aphmau is killed by Alexander, and Luzaf sacrifices his �second life' to recover hers, presumably becoming Odin's thrall for eternity, even though Nashmeira does hint to the possibility that something may be done about this situation during her coronation.<br><br></dd>

Mnejing is notably part of Karababa's welcoming ceremony, where he gets severely criticized by King of Hearts, Karababa's upstart automaton. When Ovjang gets kidnapped by the Mamool Ja, Mnejing accompanies Aphmau to try to recover her, but both are taken by Luzaf in the process. When Luzaf and Nashmeira are finally captured, Razfahd orders Ghatsad to dismantle both Automatons in order to use their parts, and the advanced programming that went into them, to complete Alexander. After the latter is defeated, Ghatsad manages to reassemble them both, presenting them to Nashmeira during her coronation (even though he actually had to melt the crown in order to fix them). Mnejing's new behavioural pattern seems to display some of Razfahd's character traits, thus serving as a walking memorial to his former owner.<br><br></dd>

	<dd>The dark deity of the Underworld.

In reality, the confrontation leads to mass destruction and is responsible for the disappearance of the Alzadaal civilization 900 years in the past. The dying Prince Luzaf makes a pact with Odin, allowing him to use his body as he sees fit in return for granting him revenge over Aht Uhrgan for destroying his homeland. Odin sees this as an opportunity to use Luzaf's body in order to manifest himself in a tangible form, if the need should arise. 200 years after Luzaf's death, Odin senses the imminent revival of Alexander and brings Luzaf back, giving him a chance to slake his revenge in preparation for Ragnarok. But Luzaf's meeting with Nashmeira changes his outlook, and he decides to challenge Odin's authority, going so far as to stop him from unleashing his attack during the confrontation with Alexander. This matches Razfahd's dying interference with Alexander, and a second Ragnarok is averted. However, Nashmeira's death forces Luzaf to give up his life to Odin once again, in order to bring her back.<br><br></dd>

She was involved in an accident in her youth which left her unable to age by crystallizing her inner Emptiness (Promathia's curse upon all living things) in visible form as a shard of magicite embedded in her chest. Cardinal Mildaurion informed her of her destiny as the Keeper (although this is later disproved) and of the fact that she intended to allow Promathia to be reborn in order to defeat him. She gave Prishe one of the Zilart amulets used to monitor the thoughts of the Kuluu in order to keep watch over her. With the help of this amulet, Prishe is also later able to communicate with Selh'teus. Despite her fate, Prishe has an energetic, devil-may-care attitude, and is wholly devoted to saving the world from the clutches of Promathia. After the Twilight God is defeated, the magicite in her chest dissolves, and she regains her mortality.<br><br></dd>

When Altana created the five civilized races in response, Promathia cursed them with Emptiness. This ensured their mortality, but also brought out one defining sin in every race. These sins are embodied by the Ark Angels. Promathia seeks to unleash the Emptiness upon the world, thus causing the death of all things, and allowing him to absorb their souls. He is bound in chains in order to prevent him from completing his purpose, but the advent of the Keeper of the Apocalypse threatens to free him.<br><br></dd>

	<dd>A sage from a nation situated on the Buburimu Peninsula. His great learning allowed the country to prosper and develop advanced technology. However, one day, one of Ramuh's machines predicted an earthquake. His kinsmen were unwilling to believe the possibility of a tragedy after so much prosperity, so they didn't take any precautions. The earthquake struck, and the people, angry at their own foolishness, began to look for a scapegoat. Suspicions naturally fell on Ramuh, who decided to exile himself to an uninhabited island after a young boy, who had lost his parents in the earthquake, threw stones at him. The nation neglected its technology, out of spite for Ramuh. Thus, when beastmen attacked them, several years later, they couldn't defend themselves. The same boy who had thrown stones at him�now grown into a man�was sent to ask Ramuh for help, and the sage accepted. He used the Staff of Olduum to wipe out the beastmen with a thunderstorm, but victory had a bitter taste. Fearful of this new power, Ramuh's kinsmen soon forced him into exile again. This time, he didn't return. The nation collapsed, but Altana rewarded Ramuh's selflessness by taking his soul to the heavens and transforming him into the Celestial Avatar of Lightning. Olduum is the name of the brightest, purple-coloured star of the Ramuh constellation. It's also the name of an ancient civilization which used to exist in the Aht Uhrgan region. It's possible that Ramuh learned how to control lightning from them on one of his travels. (See also <a href="espmon/ramuh.html">Summon:Ramuh</a>)<br><br></dd>

	<dt><b>Shiva</b></dt>
	<dd>Formerly the young ruler of a small kingdom situated in the south of Vana'diel. Despite her young age, Shiva was a wise and highly competent ruler, loved by all her people, except a small fraction of the nobility. Those were faithful to Shiva's uncle, who had been regent when she first came to the throne. Scheming with the neighbouring countries, Shiva's uncle finally managed to organize a coup. He seized the throne and banished Shiva to the frozen Northlands, reluctant to further provoke the anger of the population by executing her outright. However, the rulers with whom he had forged an alliance soon decided to take over the country. In the chaos that followed, a regiment of soldiers, led by general Aeomatra, decided to go rescue their queen. They managed to find her, frozen solid in a block of ice. Unaccustomed to the harsh climate of the Northlands, they also died one by one, refusing to leave their unfortunate queen. Altana was moved by Shiva's plight and transformed her into the Celestial Avatar of Ice. Aeomatra is the name of the brightest, light blue-coloured star of the Shiva constellation.

	<dd>A skilled Samurai from an unknown nation to the Far East. His land is being overrun by the Emptiness, and he comes to Jeuno seeking help, as they are known to have harnessed the power of the Mothercrystals. Tenzen is also the guardian of Phoenix, as the avatar's spirit inhabits his sword. Every soul the sword claims serves to uphold Phoenix's lifeforce. Thus, when people started falling prey to the Emptiness in Tenzen's homeland, they were sacrificed in Phoenix's name, which is a source of great doubt for him. He plays a major role in Chains of Promathia, as he initially tries to stop Selh'teus from spreading the Emptiness further. Having spoken with the remaining Terrestrial Avatars, he comes to believe that Prishe is the Keeper of the Apocalypse. Bahamut suggests that the Keeper should be sacrificed to stop the return of Promathia. Therefore, Tenzen attempts to kill Prishe, but eventually repents, and helps the rest of the group defeat the Twilight God. Deeply moved by all he has witnessed, and still feeling guilt for his misguided actions, he then asks his teammates for forgiveness, before returning to his homeland.<br><br></dd>

	<dt><b>Titan</b></dt>
	<dd>Originally a member of a tribe of giants (the Titans) who lived in the south of the Quon continent. The tribe was in conflict with the people of a neighbouring city over the ownership and utilization of a forest. Despite their great physical strength, the Titans were eventually overwhelmed by force of sheer numbers. However, one day, a little girl called Daemdalus was looking for a runaway lamb in the forest. She stumbled upon what looked like the corpse of a Titan. It turned out that it was still alive, and, overcoming her fear, Daemdalus showed him compassion by tending to his wounds. The Titan befriended the little girl, but it wasn't long before the inhabitants of the city found out what was going on. They captured the Titan and brought him back to the city. Daemdalus threw herself in front of him in a desperate attempt to stop him from being executed. Seeing her efforts, Altana took pity and called both their souls to the heavens. She transformed Titan into the Celestial Avatar of Earth. Daemdalus is the name of the brightest, yellow-coloured star of the Titan constellation.

He is next in line to succeed his father, but, in the San d'Oria Mission Storyline, Papsque Shamonde insists that Lightbringer should be found to designate the rightful heir (the one who will supposedly lead San d'Oria to discover the Gates of Paradise). Both Trion and Pieuje are also responsible for attempting to assassinate their uncle, Rochefogne, because of doubts as to his identity and fear for San d'Oria's reputation. Upon discovering this, Destin postpones his decision as to his successor, demanding that his sons right their ways and prove their worth honourably. Trion is a very skilled swordsman, and used to have a sparring partner in General Curilla of the Temple Knights, but her over-eagerness to best him in a tournament led to her losing an eye. Nevertheless, it is repeatedly hinted that the he is not indifferent to her charms. In Treasures of Aht Uhrgan, a more humorous side to Trion is shown, as he attempts to infiltrate the Empire under the guise of a mercenary called Raillefal. He is also involved in the sidequest for the Paladin's artifact armour.<br><br></dd>

Moreover, Zeid, who believes that Volker willfully took credit for the Shadow Lord's defeat, reveals to him the truth about Ulrich's treachery. The shame of this discovery, along with his misgivings about his position lead him to confront Zeid in duel, attempting to persuade him to accept his rightful place. But Zeid acknowledges his strength, telling him that he is a much better example for Bastok, because he is able to give his fellow citizens hope, something that Zeid has abandoned.<br><br></dd>

This is partly due to his involvement with Raogrimm, and partly because of his path as a Dark Knight. In Rise of the Zilart, after defeating the resurrected Shadow Lord, Zeid decides to put a stop to Kam'lanaut's and Eald'narche's plans, alongside Aldo and Lion.
