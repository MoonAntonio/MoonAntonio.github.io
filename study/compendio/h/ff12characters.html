        <dd>A leading member of the ruling Margrace family of
        Rozarria, Al-Cid also happens to be a smooth lady-killer
        with a heavy Spanish accent. He's constantly surrounded by
        fawning female retainers. His ham-it-up lines belie a
        cunning intellect and political savvy, and a genuine desire
        for peace and prosperity. He comes to Mt Bur-Omisace to
        meet Ashe and Larsa to plan a peace treaty, but the death
        of Emperor Gramis changes the tides. He has interest in
        going against both the Empire and the Resistance in their
        strong desire for war.<br>
        [RW] Apparently Al-Cid has made good on his offer to Queen
        Ashe to visit him in Ambervale, his royal retreat, as she
        mentions having gone there.<br>

        on the holy mountain.<br>

        <dt><b><a name="ashe">Ashelia</a> B'Nargin Dalmasca,
        Princess</b> [HERO]</dt>
           
        <dd>Better known as Ashe, the heroine of FF12's story,
        Princess Ashe had her uncle Marquis Ondore announce her
        death of a broken heart after her husband, Rasler, and
        father, Raminas, were slain by the Archadian Empire. She is
        a fierce leader, even harder on herself than those she
        leads, and is cold to the point of solitude. She joins
        Vossler as part of the resistance against the Empire, going
        under the name Amalia, in her attack against the Royal
        Palace during Lord Vayne's fete. She is later captured by
        Archadia and put aboard the Dreadnought Leviathan.
        Eventually, she goes with Vaan and the others in her long
        quest to restore Dalmasca to its former honor. She is
        almost obsessed with nethicite, seeing its power as the
        best way to effect that restoration, but is conflicted
        about whether she wants to use it to actually destroy the
        Empire, her hatred of the Empire sometimes blinding her.
        Matters aren't made any better when she discovers that the
        Occuria are using her to effect their own views about how
        hume history should go. She eventually decides that using
        the nethicite is wrong, and destroys the Sun-Cryst,
        preferring to attack the Empire conventionally and
        overthrow it, with the help of Larsa, rather than destroy
        it.<br>
        [RW] Ashe joins the party late in the game, but resolves to
        fight Mydia and Feolthanos to protect the peace of her
        country. She arrives on the <i>Leviathan</i> with Basch,
        indicating the new peace between Dalmasca and Archades.<br>

        <dt><b>Ba'Gamnan</b></dt>

        <dd>A bangaa headhunter chasing after Balthier for the
        bounty. We first see him when the party is thrown into
        Nalbina Dungeons; later, Ba'Gamnan kidnaps Penelo and
        leaves a letter telling Balthier to come to Lhusu Mines to
        rescue her. Ba'Gamnan later (in a side quest) begins
        chasing after clan hunters. Montblanc and Monid, a bangaa
        Centurio clan member, set up a bogus mark in a far-out
        place (the Nam-Yensa Sandsea), intending Vaan and Balthier
        to take it, so that Ba'Gamnan will show up and be defeated
        - which inevitably happens. Voiced by Steven Blum.<br>
        <acronym title="FF12 Clan Primer">CP</acronym>: Being a
        bangaa headhunter, intent on capturing the sky pirate
        Balthier. Vicious and cruel, he will do anything to claim a
        bounty, not hesistating for a moment to dirty his own
        hands. Though Ba'Gamnan is guilty of more than enough to
        deserve a price on his own head, his unofficial role as
        Judge Gabranth's dark hand ensures his good name with the
        law. His three henchmen are, if anything, crueler and more
        lacking in mores than he, were that possible.<br>
        [RW] Ba'Gamnan plays a much larger role in the sequel,
        constantly being a thorn in the side of the party. He
        actually joins you for some of the earlier battles, against
        his will - Tomaj's special electrified muzzle sees to that.
        He has a fallout with his three cronies, who waver between
        being for him and against him throughout the game.
        Essentially, he spends most of the game frantically
        attacking anyone and everyone he can.<br>

        <dt><b><a name="balthier">Balthier</a></b> [HERO]</dt>
        <dd><i>(Aliases: Balthier (NA), Balflear (JP))</i> Real
        name: Ffamran Bunansa. The self-proclaimed leading man of
        the story. Balthier is the closest thing to James Bond yet
        found in an RPG: suave, action-packed, carrying firearms,
        casually hanging out with scantily-clad women, and, of
        course, British. Balthier lives the good life as a carefree
        sky pirate and captain of the <i>Strahl</i>, searching for
        treasure wherever it takes him, with his viera sidekick
        Fran. In his journeys he meets up with Vaan and Ashe, and
        quite against his will finds himself caught up in the fray.
        Though one wouldn't call him kind (his act in demanding
        Ashe's wedding ring as payment for his services seems
        unnecessarily cruel), he doesn't leave his friends in the
        lurch. Of course he's got a tragic past: he's the son of
        Dr. Cid, whom he ran away from after Venat essentially
        drove Cid insane. He was apparently made a Judge at his
        father's behest, which illustrates just how crazy Cid must
        have been (it seems similar to Caligula making his horse a
        senator... in a certain light at least).<br>
        [RW] Balthier is just as enigmatic as ever - he almost goes
        too far, keeping important information from Vaan and
        actually coming to blows with him due to Vaan's
        misunderstanding of the situation revolving around Mydia
        and the auracite. When Vaan finally accepts his views,
        Balthier tells Vaan that he's only going to play a
        supporting role in this story - Vaan's now the leading man.
        As ever, Fran is always by his side.<br>

        Raminas's death at Nalbina Fortress soon after. He was set
        up for the crime by his brother Gabranth. His guilt and
        execution were announced by Ondore, though Vayne quietly
        stayed it to life in solitary prison in the Nalbina
        Dungeon; Basch is meant to be a blackmail tool against
        Ondore if he should step out of line. He is rescued by Vaan
        and Ashe in their own escape attempt. Though both Vaan and
        Ashe initially blame him for the deaths of their brother
        and father, respectively, they eventually come to realize
        that he truly was innocent of his crimes. Basch devotes
        himself entirely to protecting Princess Ashe in her quest
        to restore Dalmasca, and grows weary of the fighting. He is
        a keen, cunning, and noble warrior, and after the game ends
        he becomes a Judge, taking over his brother's goal of
        protecting Lord Larsa.<br>
        [RW] In his capacity as Judge, he accompanies Queen Ashe to
        Lemur&eacute;s as a representative of Archadia, and fights
        bravely alongside Vaan and the others. His strength of will
        is shown when Mydia tries to get him to blame himself for
        the deaths of the soldiers at Nalbina, including Velis, but
        Basch will have none of it.<br>

        hero worship, but is quickly disillusioned by Vayne's
        increasingly harsh rule and his role in their father's
        death. Larsa joins the party as a guest twice during the

        name Lamont, where he searches for manufacted nethicite to
        assuage his suspicions about the Empire's source for it.
        Next he comes with them to Mt Bur-Omisace in an attempt to
        plan a peace treaty. Vayne treats Larsa as a minor
        annoyance, but appears not to wish him any harm. He
        instructs Gabranth to protect Larsa, a task Gabranth passes
        on to Basch after his death and Larsa's appointment as the
        new Emperor at the end of the game.<br>

        Sky Saloon aboard the <i>Galbana</i>, and contents himself

        <dt><b>Tomaj</b></dt>

        <dd>The proprietor of the Sandsea, a pub in Rabanastre.
        Tomaj is also a member of Clan Centurio, and provides Vaan
        with an introduction to licenses and hunting marks.<br>
        [RW] Tomaj plays a much larger role here, acting as the
        intelligence gatherer of Clan Galbana as well as its
        merchant extraordinaire and the <i>Galbana</i>'s mechanic.
        Although he never enters battle, he takes care of almost
        everything else, with many a wry observation.<br>

        <dt><b>Vaan</b> [HERO]</dt>

        <dd>In this game, you're Vaan and Vaan's you. Although he
        does have some stake in the story, for most of it he's more
        of an observer than anything else. Vaan is the brother of
        Reks, the soldier killed by Gabranth (disguised as Basch)
        two years previously. He lives as an orphan in Rabanastre,
        with Migelo as a sort of foster father for him and his
        friends, giving him odd jobs to do. He is a relatively
        simple, lively, friendly, sometimes clumsy
        seventeen-year-old, with absolutely no fashion sense (and
        an apparent aversion to washing his face). He loves
        adventure, dreaming to one day own his own airship and
        become a sky pirate. He has no love for the Empire, but his
        hatred of it isn't as great as one might think it'd be. He
        would like to see Dalmasca back in its glory, though, so he
        tags along with Ashe to protect her in her quest to get it
        done.<br>
        [RW] Vaan is the real protagonist in the sequel, leading
        rather than following. We also see more of his
        light-hearted side; he's a typical strong-willed,
        pep-talking adventurous leader. He feels deeply for Llyud
        and the aegyl's plight, and resolves to help them in any
        way he can.<br>

        <dt><b>Vayne Solidor, Lord</b> [VILLAIN]</dt>

        <dd>A ruthlessly ambitious member of the ruling House of
        Archadia, Vayne got his way up first to the Dalmascan
        Consul and then to the throne by essentially killing all
        his older brothers and his father, though never in a way
        that would incriminate him. He is fairly pragmatic for a
        despot, and his true goal is shared with Cid: to shake off
        the chokehold of the Occuria on hume affairs. To that end
        he allies with Venat against Dalmasca and the Resistance.
        He endures his younger brother Larsa, whom he sees as
        insufferably optimistic. He's a fairly good actor, giving a
        speech in his inauguration as consul which seemed to go
        well (at least, most of the commoners seemed to want to
        give him a chance, rather than ripping him apart as they
        might be excused for wanting to do). At the very end, he
        merges with Venat and the <i>Bahamut</i> to form The
        Undying, the final boss of the game. He perhaps does not
        realize that by fighting against being a pawn of the
        Occuria, he unwittingly ended up being a pawn of Venat.<br>

        <dt><b>Velis</b></dt>

        <dd>[RW] A hume living in Rabanastre, and lover of Mydia.
        He died in the Nalbina war, causing her to go mad with
        sorrow and rage. Mydia later tries to revive him, but only
        succeeds in creating a Yarhi that looks like him. Penelo
        and Vaan encounter "Velis" in Tswarra, but Mydia eventually
        turns him against them. When they end up in Lesrekta, the
        Yarhi Velis implores them to destroy him and help Mydia
        find her anima again.<br>

        <dt><b>Venat</b> [VILLAIN]</dt>

        <dd>Venat is one of the Occuria, the ageless manipulators
        of humanity, who rebels against their control and avers
        that the humes should decide their own fates. To that end,
        he himself turns to manipulating particular humes (i.e. Cid
        and Vayne) to go against the Occuria's current goal of the
        destruction of the Empire (and, in particular, he schemes
        to get the humes to destroy the Sun-Cryst). He is the one
        who taught the secret of manufacting nethicite to Cid.
        Apparently he is able to control those who are subjected to
        manufacted nethicite, as are Mjrn and Judge Bergan. Only at
        the very end of the game does Venat do anything active: he
        merges with Vayne and the <i>Bahamut</i> to create the
        Undying, the final boss. (Although I use "he" to describe
        Venat, it's impossible to tell what, if any, gender he
        actually is.)<br>

        <dt><b>Vossler Azelas</b> [GUEST]</dt>

        <dd>An old friend of Basch's, Vossler was with him and Reks
        at the attack on Nalbina two years ago. After learning of
        the king's death, he immediately headed to Rabanastre to
        help Ashe escape. Since then, he heads the Resistance and
        protects Princess Ashe. He is suspicious of everyone, and
        quite difficult to get along with (rather like Ashe
        herself, in fact). He later rescues the party from the
        Dreadnought Leviathan at the behest of Marquis Ondore. He
        then catches up with them on the way to Raithwall's Tomb,
        but his true aim is to take the Dawn Shard and hand it over
        to the Empire in exchange for them allowing Ashe to take
        her throne. He gives the party over to Judge Ghis on the
        Shiva, but is defeated by them after their escape, and
        explodes with the rest of the ship.<br>

        <dd>The commander of the Empire's 12th Fleet and the
        <i>Alexander</i>. A pragmatic man whose loyalty to the
        Empire sometimes preempts his conscience, but his
        conscience still remains. He supports Vayne in his bid for
        the throne. He tries to convince Vayne to pardon Judge
        Drace, but is unsuccessful, and is ashamed of his role in
        the attack on Mt. Bur-Omisace.<br>
