            [FF7] The mysterious and
            happy-go-lucky daughter of a Cetra and a human seems almost too
            good to be true for Cloud... and it soon turns out that she is. The daughter of Ifalna, an Ancient, and Professor Gast, the scientist who found her, Aerith is raised by Elmyra as a daughter, but knows things she shouldn't. She spends all her time in a church in the Sector 5 Slums, raising the only flowers to grow in Midgar.
            Aerith's tragic history is cut all too short by Sephiroth, who makes
            sure she doesn't get in the way of his plan. Her magical powers
            are admired by all, and even she doesn't understand most of the
            things she feels. (See also <a href="fftcharacters.html">Character:Tactics</a>,

            [CC] Aerith is one of the important people in Zack's life, as shown in the DMW reel. He meets her
			when first dropping from the sky into the Sector 5 Church, and they quickly develop a relationship.
			Zack is the one who gives her her trademark ribbon, and convinces her to sell her flowers.
			When he disappears in Nibelheim, she writes constant letters to him via Tseng. Only the final one,
			tucked into an Angeal copy, makes its way to him four years later. Even in the afterlife, Aerith and 
			Zack remain together.

		wing. He begins degrading, the same way Genesis does, and for most of the game he follows Genesis in an attempt to redeem himself. He has a very strong sense of honor, though this is often challenged and confused by the events that occur.

            [FF7]  The dark-skinned
            leader of AVALANCHE is a trash-talkin', go-get-'em type of leader.
            The gun-arm he got grafted onto him makes him a powerful force in
            battle. He harbors deep hatred towards Shinra for needlessly
            torching his town, North Corel. He cares deeply for his adopted daughter
            Marlene. (See also <a href="jobs/gunner.html#FF7barret">Jobs:Gunner</a>)

            [FF7] Good old Bugen is the resident wise man, although it's
            unnerving to hear him go "Ho Ho Hoo!" about everything. He has kind
            of a weird sense of humour. He's Red XIII's grandfather, which
            raises a lot of questions, let me tell you. He enjoys both nature
            and machinery, an anomaly in RPGs.

            -->[FF7]  This cute little
            guy is described as a "Toysaurus" in the manual. He's a toy cat riding a giant
            <a href="species/moogle.html">Moogle</a>. He starts out talking normally, but at
            the end of the game degenerates into Southern drawl. He uses a
            megaphone in battle to command his Moogle to attack. When the team
            meets him at Gold Saucer, he specializes in telling fortunes. In
            reality, he's controlled by Reeve, head of the Shinra Urban
            Development Section. The nature of how he's being controlled is
            still a mystery. Sometimes the cat shows he can move and act
            independently of Reeve, showing that he's not <i>directly</i>
            controlled by him. Other times Reeve can speak directly through
            him. He originally joined Cloud to spy for Shinra, but he joins him
            later when he realizes the evil nature of President Shinra and his
            intentions. The first Cait Sith is destroyed halfway through the
            game, but immediately replaced by Cait Sith No. 2. (See also

            [AC]  Cait Sith does
            appear in FF7:AC, but nothing about what he's done in two years is
            known. He is likely still controlled by Reeve, but seems to have
            lost his puppet Moogle and now rides Red XIII. For some odd reason he
            now has a Scottish accent.

            [DoC]  Reeve continues to
            use Cait Sith robots as a tool, disguise, and companion. Between
            Meteorfall and the present, Reeve has lost Cait Sith nos. 2 through
            4, probably through similar means as shown in the beginning of the
            game, where Cait puts on a "Reeve suit" which is promptly
            assassinated by a Deepground soldier. The real Reeve and the Cait
            Sith in the suit stay unharmed. The player controls Cait for a
            short segment in the game until number 5 gets consumed in darkness
            in an attempt at infiltrating Deepground HQ. During this segment,
            Cait Sith has pitiful attacks and HP, being more useful as a covert
            stealth op. Later, Cait Sith No. 6 introduces himself aboard the
            Shera.

        <dt><b>Chaos</b> </dt>
        <dd>
            [DoC] In the original FF7, this was simply Vincent's final
            Limit Break. However, in DoC we learn more about what Chaos really
            is, that he is a sentient xenoform of the Planet. According to an
            ancient Cetran tablet, Chaos is "soul wrought of terra corrupt" and
            "Omega's squire to the lofty heavens". This indicates that Chaos is
            a harbinger of lifestream and its job is to "scourge the world of
            all things living, sending them back to the Lifestream" for Omega.
            When Omega makes its journey to the stars, Chaos is left to remain
            with the dying planet. The Planet also created a "Protomateria"
            meant to control Chaos and prolong awaking Omega. Lucrecia finds a
            way to create Chaos through Vincent using the "Chaos gene"; along
            with the Protomatria, she finds an "impure" materia fountain which
            apparently is meant to be the source of Chaos. She also implants
            the Protomateria in him to help him control it. In the end, it is
            through Chaos that Vincent stops Omega, returning both to the
            Planet. (NOTE: Chaos is the final boss in <a href="ff1characters.html">FF1</a> and is the true nature of the Earl
            Tyrant in <a href="ffucharacters.html">FF: Unlimited</a>. None of them appear to be directly related, however.)<br>

            middle-aged aviator. His dream was always to go into space, but
            thanks to a bit of extra spot-checking by his underling Shera, who
            put herself in danger to make sure the launch went through, he

She is important enough to him to be part of his DMW reel. She has said that she has no parents and was raised by Shinra. Several times, she mentions that "Cissnei" is not her real name. This is actually a reference to the cell phone game <i>Before Crisis</i>. In that game, Cissnei appears as a generic Turk (often referred to as "Shuriken") who does not have a default name, but must be named by the player. In other words, Cissnei doesn't <i>have</i> a real name.<br>

            [FF7]  The very dedicated hero of FF7 (although to what, he's not always entirely sure). He
            sports a spiky hairdo and a purple SOLDIER outfit, and likes using
            big swords (his Buster Sword first belonged to Angeal, and then Zack). He begins the game as a cold-hearted loner, but this is largely because he lost most of his memories after being an experiment of Hojo's. He's a childhood acquaintance of Tifa, though not quite as good a friend as he thinks. He is obsessed with destroying Sephiroth, but as it turns out, this urge is brought on by Sephiroth himself, to bring Cloud to the Jenova Reunion. As he explores more of himself, including his innate psychological weakness, he begins to open up and be more caring.

            [AC]  Since the Meteor

            friends, up to the point where he hasn't seen any of them for two
            years. No doubt his guilt over his action (or inaction) over
            the death of Aerith (for whom he obviously
            still carries a torch) has caused his estrangement,. With his motorcycle Fenrir, he runs a
            delivery service with Tifa, from whom he receives his orders via
            cellphone. His pattern is broken when he receives a call from Rufus
            Shinra, and makes contact with the children of Sephiroth. He also
            has a new sword, called "First Sword", which he
            can split into two separate swords and reform to make one really
            long one.

We find Cloud as a rather shy, overwhelmed young man, as befits his backwater origins, though he has a streak of courage and strength in him. In CC, Zack asks Cloud to "live both their lives" before he dies; this contradicts FF7's intimation that Cloud simply took on Zack's life out of a defense mechanism.<br></dd>

            [DoC]  A Shinra Class A
            scientist specializing in biotechnology. The events given to us by
            the story are confusing, but we know a few things. Before she
            joined with Hojo, she worked with Grimoire Valentine (Vincent's
            father) on discovering Chaos and Omega, based on an ancient Cetran
            tablet. She blames herself for the accident which likely killed
            him. They also discovered the protomateria, and the crystalline
            spring that is supposed to be the birthplace for Chaos. Later, she
            joins with Hojo and has Vincent Valentine of the Turks assigned to
            her as a bodyguard. We know that she harbored some affection for
            Vincent, but ultimately turned away from him to proceed with Hojo's
            experiement (Sephiroth). Vincent became angry at Hojo, asking why
            he let this happen (assumably he's talking about taking her son
            away from her). Hojo shoots him in response, then uses his body to
            perform experiments on him, creating the monsters that he
            transforms into. Lucrecia gets control of him and merges Vincent
            with the Chaos gene to bring him back to life, and also provided
            him with the Protomateria to control the gene. Vincent sees her in
            the crystalline spring, but what we're exactly looking at is
            unknown, since her body "crumbled" long ago (some theorize that her
            appearance in the waterfall cave was just a reflection of herself).
            At some point, Lucrecia makes a copy of her brain as a sort of
            confession to Vincent. Later, Shelke uploads this image into her
            brain to find Vincent and the Protomateria. She also gains some of
            her personality as well.

        <dt><b>Omega</b> </dt>
        <dd>
            [DoC] Omega is similar to the other Weapons created by the
            Planet, but designed to to maintain and protect the flow of life in
            the most dire circumstances. When the end of the world comes, Omega
            is to awaken and collect all of Lifestream within it. Its squire,
            Chaos, is meant to send any and all who are still living to
            Lifestream in order to be collected. Only "pure" souls will become
            Omega; Chaos is born from "impure" Lifestream. (Although the nature
            of this "purity" is not well defined, it's evident that anyone with
            Geostigma is "impure", and that the fountain where Lucrecia found
            the Protomateria was also "impure".) Once Omega has all the lives,
            sentient and non-sentient, it will begin a journey through the
            stars (for points unknown, maybe to settle on another planet, maybe
            as a floating testament to all which once lived) However,
            Deepground, led by Weiss (who himself is controlled by Hojo) tries
            to awaken Omega early by sacrificing pure lives (i.e. people clean
            of Geostigma) to Mako Reactor 0. Doing this convinces Omega that
            the end times are near, and causes it to awaken. However, by using
            the Protomateria, Weiss/Hojo intends to merge with Omega (the same
            way Vincent merged with Chaos) and give Hojo the power of
            Lifestream and immortality. When "Dark Nero" merges with Weiss and
            evokes Omega, the giant Weapon, nearly twice the size of Midgar,
            begins sucking all the Lifestream from the planet. Vincent travels
            through its core and destroys it, redistributing Lifestream back to
            the Planet, along with itself and Chaos. (NOTE: Omega is also a major
            player in <a href="ffucharacters.html">FF: Unlimited</a>.) (See

            [DoC] Shelke was kidnapped at age nine, ten years ago, and

            into networks (through something called a "synaptic net dive") and
            can incorporate computer data into her psyche. Because of this she
            became emotionless and cold. Her body became weak and requires a
            daily dose Mako, and she still looks like a nine-year-old. During
            the assault on Midgar, she guides Vincent via cell phone from her

            and the comfort of people around her she opens up, and becomes more

            [FF7]  President Shinra rules Midgar with an iron fist, controlling
            his interests through money and media. He claims to be serving the

            [DoC]  One year after AC,
            Vincent is the central protagonist in DoC. We learn that Vincent
            was part of the Turks, and assigned as protection for Lucrecia
            Crescent. Through his service he fell for her, though she did not
            return the feeling. Instead, she decided to join with Hojo. She
            also decided to experiment on her own child (Sephiroth), much to
            his protests. During a confrontation with Hojo over this, Hojo
            shoots him, and uses his corpse for experimentation, making
            Vincent's body nearly indestructable. Somewhere, Lucrecia gets a
            hold of him and merges him with the Chaos, only possible through
            Hojo's previous experiments. Later, Vincent transforms into Chaos
            before her eyes, and she narrowly implants the Protomateria in his
            body to help him control it. Hojo finds out, and laughs at her
            unfeeling attitude toward science, just like him. Lucrecia is
            consumed with guilt and runs away. Somewhere along the lines,
            Vincent leaves the capsule he was in, obtains his clothes, and
            crawls into his coffin. Although he's just as taciturn, his
            feelings, especially for Lucrecia, begin to bubble to the surface.
            Although he is aloof, and short of speech, he's kinder than he
            looks, and always willing to help others.

            [DoC]  Yuffie rescues
            Vincent twice, and tags along with the WRO several times (she's
            never awake during Vincent's fights for various reasons, though, so
            he can't count on her as a party member). She's just as hyper as
            before, but seems to have toned down the urge to steal stuff.

		<dd>[CC] Yuffie appears as a ten-year-old, first when Zack infiltrates Fort Tamblin in Wutai, and later in a variety of optional missions, during which she sends anonymous e-mails to Zack with treasure tips, then generally steals the treasure when he's done beating up the monsters. Apparently she got his e-mail address by listening in at AVALANCHE meetings.<br></dd>

            [FF7]  Cloud's alterego
            of a sort. He was the real SOLDIER; Cloud just <i>thought</i> he was one.
            A confused Cloud took over his job, so to speak, and his persona,
            after Zack was killed by Shinra soldiers. His parents live in
            Gongaga. (See also <a href="ehrgeiz.html">External

		<dd>[CC] Zack is the hero of Crisis Core. Angeal calls him "Zack the Puppy" due to his ebullient energy and insistence on rushing into things. As the game progresses, Zack gets more thoughtful and caring. He is in love with Aerith and after escaping from Shinra Manor, becomes almost motherly towards Cloud. Although not really understanding the term, he embodies Angeal's vision of honor, and always tries to do what's right even if he's sometimes confused about events around him.<br></dd>
