<h4>Changes in the versions:</h4>
<p><b>6</b> (98.9.18): A full entry for FF Tactics, plus a few more 
things form previous games.  Probably the biggest find is the Carl Orff 
references in Sephiroth's theme.
<p><b>5</b> (97.8.19): FFVII, the entire FF Legend 
series, and Bahamut Lagoon get full-sized entries for the first time, 
plus assorted tidbits from various other games.  Also, there's a 
"Further Reading" section at the bottom for those of you who want even 
more. ^^;
<p><b>4</b> (97.1.09): Lots more stuff about Seiken Densetsu 3 and FF3, 
and a whole bunch of other useful things.  And a smaller graphic at the 
top, to cut down on loading time.
<p><b>3</b> (Feb. '96): In this one, <b>Andrew Vestal</b> and I combined 
our two lists to form one big file.  I rearranged and alphabetized some 
things so that the monsters, characters, items, etc. are kept together.
<p><b>2.1</b> (95.10.13): A whole lot more stuff. Extra special thanks 
go out to <b>Kate Malloy</b> and <b>Andrew Thompson</b> for all their 
valuable info. 
<p><b>2.0 </b>(95.9.22): More games are included, and more stuff sent in 
by all you alert readers out there...
<p><b>1.1</b> (May '95): Just about the same as 1.0 except Phoenix is 
included. 
<p><b>1.0</b> (April '95): This is the first version. I only really 
dealt with FF2 and 3.<p>

<ul>If you're already familiar with this file, and want to jump to the 
new stuff, look for the stuff in this list... note that for items 
appearing in multiple games, I included it where it first appeared, or 
where it is most prominent.
<li> FFI: the Rosetta Stone, the Rune Sword
<li> FF3j: Nautilus
<li> FFII: Namingway, Soma Drop, Giott, Medusa, HugeNaga, Ogopogo, 
Prokaryote, Eukaryote
<li> FFV: Samson Power
<li> FFIII: Golem
<li> CT: Macabre
<li> Bahamut Lagoon: Toulouse, Reve/Lowe, Melodia, Taicho, Gunsou, 
Mahal, Berge Kamerad, XZ, Cassandra, Dreadnought

<ul><li> FF1 = FF1
<li>FF2j - not translated
<li>FF3j - also not translated
<li>FF4j = FF2US
<li>FF5j - not translated (at least, not officially! ^_^;)
<li>FF6j = FF3US
<li>FF7 and FFT are identical to their import counterparts
<li>Seiken Densetsu = FF Adventure
<li>SD2 = Secret of Mana
<li>SD3 - not translated

<hr>
<p>I'll start out at the beginning with the FF series' first game... 

<a name="ff1"><h3>Final Fantasy</h3>

<p>The sword <b>Excalibur</b> of British legend makes its first of 
several FF-series appearances here when you acquire <b>Adamant</b> 
(something else that shows up a few times) and give it to the smith. 
Excalibur was the sword that King Arthur pulled from the stone to prove 
his worthiness as king. The ideas of knighthood and chivalry date back 
to Arthur's time. 

<p>The Japanese sword <b>Masamune</b>: One explanation is that there was 
a feudal lord named "Masamune Date" (Date (da-te) is the family name) 
who ruled Rikuzen (area near Sendai) around the early 1600's. He lost 
one of his eyes due to sickness in childhood, and he was nicknamed 
"Dokuganryuu Masamune" (Masamune, the one eyed dragon).  Another story 
says that there was a blacksmith named "Masamune", and his sword was so 
sharp that you could drive it into the ground in a lake, and leaves that 
floated by would float around the Masamune due to its holy power.  
Masamune is written like this in Japanese:
<tt><pre><p>
________      ,
   |      |--------|
   |--      ------
 | |       --------
 | |          |
--------   /  |  \   
</pre></tt>

would be the Kanji. (it's hard to write kanji in ASCII!) 

<p><b>Murasame</b>: (This isn't actually in FF1, but I wanted to put it 
with the Masamune) The characters are "town" (mura) and "rain" (ame). 
Murasame is used to define a rain that rains in small area. (Sometimes 
quick rain) Thus, it could mean Murasame can cause "quick blood rain". 
(And in some stories, Murasame is cursed.  Though the leaves floating 
down the river will avoid the Masamune, they float right into the 
Murasame and get split in two.) 

<p>Another weapon is the <b>Rune Sword</b> - runes were the letters used 
by Icelanders and other Nordic people over 1000 years ago.  They were 
believed to have magical properties, and supposedly were invented by 
Odin himself.

<a name="ff1baham"><p><b>Bahamut</b>: He's in all three of the US 
Final Fantasy games, and FF5 as well. He's supposed to be a great dragon 
of some kind, possibly the king of the dragons.  But in another story, 
the world is being held up by an angel standing on a ruby mountain.  The 
mountain lies on top of a bull (sometimes called Kujata, who's in FF7) 
with four thousand of various body parts, which in turn stands on a fish 
which swims through the darkness.  And it turns out that Bahamut is the 
fish that holds up the world!  

<p><b>Pirates</b>: Some speculation... there are two types of enemies 
that look like pirates in FF1... one is called "Pirate" (no surprise 
there) and the other is "<b>Kyzoku</b>"... maybe the latter could be a 
misspelling of the Japanese word "Kaizoku", which means pirate... has 
anybody out there played the Japanese FF1 and can tell me that game's 
names?

<p><b>Giants</b> (and Frost Giants): Enemies in FF1. The Frost Giants 
come from Nordic mythology. The father of the Frost Giants was Ymir, and 
with his cow Audumla he created the Aesir, and Odin (a really familiar 
name if you like FF) is among them. (I'm skipping a large portion of 
this story. For more info, check your local library ^_^) 

<p>The <b>Cockatrice</b>makes its first appearance here.  Supposedly 
they were deadly winged serpents from biblical times.

<p>The <b>Sphinx</b> makes an appearance in FF1 for the first time. 
(It's in FFMQ and FFA as well.)  It had a lion's body, a woman's head 
and shoulders, and eagle's wings.  It would sit alongside a road and ask 
travelers that came by a riddle and eat anyone who got it wrong.  The 
riddle: "What animal has four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and 
three legs in the evening?" You've probably heard the answer... a human 
being!

<p>The <b>Four Fiends</b> of FF1 all have mythological names.  The idea 
of four elements (earth, fire, air, and water) making up all matter in 
the cosmos goes back to the ancient Greeks.  But the Fiends' names 
aren't all Greek.  They're more obscure than most, and many game players 
might miss them. So I've outlined them here...
<ul>
   <li><b>Kraken</b>: A mythical giant squid, supposedly. I've also 
heard stories of Kraken being a sea monster.  Could be either 
Scandinavian or Greek in origin.  Supposedly a Kraken lies in the 
Straits of Gibraltar waiting for unlucky ships.

   <li><b>Kary</b>:  The Fiend of Fire in FF1, Kary could be an 
alternate spelling of Kali from Indian myths.  Kali demanded human 
sacrifices of her worshipers and had skin blacker than the night sky.  
She had three eyes, four arms, and giant tusks coming from her mouth.

   <li><b>Lich</b>:  "Lich" is Old English for "corpse" or "dead body".  
(The German word for "dead body" is "Leiche"; they're related.)  Also, a 
Lich is a kind of undead mage with no soul; a powerful magic user who 
chose to trade his soul for immortality as an undead.

   <li><b>Tiamat</b>:  In Akkadian mythology, Tiamat is the mother of 
the other gods.  She has five heads (blue, red, black, green, and white)  
In some stories, she is enemy of Bahamut, king of the dragons.</li></ul>

<p><b>Aegis Shield</b>: You find this in the tower in the middle of the 
desert.  The Aegis was the breastplate of Zeus, and, later, Athena.  The 
word "aegis" means "protection".  The Aegis Shield is in FF5j and FF3 as 
well.

<p><b>Gaia</b>: The town in the northeast in this game; it can be 
reached only with the airship. "Gaia" means Earth; she was the earth 
goddess who married Uranus, god of the heavens. The word is best known 
from James Lovelock's Gaia Hypothesis, which treats the Earth as a 
self-sustaining organism.  In the latest FF vocal CD, the main theme of 
FF1 is called "Gaia" (and mentions Lovelock in the liner notes!).  Also, 
FF3 features Gaea Gear (an alternate spelling). 

<p>The <b>Slab</b>: You need the slab so that Dr. Unne can translate the 
Lefeinish language.  I think the Slab was inspired by the Rosetta Stone, 
a stone slab found in 1799 by French soldiers near the town of Rashid 
(known as Rosetta in French).  It had a message written in Greek, 
Egyptian hieroglyphics, and demotic (Egyptian cursive writing), and in 
1828, Jean Champollion used it to translate the Egyptian language for 
the first time. <i>Update...</i> three and a half years after writing 
the preceding entry, I've found that in the original Japanese FF1, that 
item is indeed called 'rozetta ishi', or the Rosetta Stone.  So feel 
free to omit 'I think' from the preceding paragraph. ^_^
<hr>

<a name="ff3j"><h3>Final Fantasy 3j</h3>

<p>The submarine <b>Nautilus</b> comes from Jules Verne's 19th century 
science fiction novel <i>20,000 Leagues Under the Sea</i>.

And from Square's first 16-bit Final Fantasy game, 

<a name="ff2"><h3>Final Fantasy 2</h3>

<p>Character Names: <a name="ff2rydia"><b>Rydia</b> is supposedly named 
after the legendary country of Lydia (the names are the same in 
Japanese), which was the richest in the world in its day and the first 
to use coins as money. They once had a king named Croesus, and he's the 
one they're talking about in the (seldom-heard) expression "as rich as 
Croesus". 
<p>I'd like to think <b>Cecil</b> was named after former Hanshin Tiger 
Cecil Fielder  (they're pronounced the same way), but this probably 
can't be proven. There's a person in the Christian Bible named Cain, 
similar to FF2's <b>Kain</b>.
 <p><b>Rosa</b>'s name just means 'rose'. (How could I forget to put 
this in? :)
 <p><b>Cid</b>'s name was probably inspired by the Spanish story "El 
Cid".  The Tale of El Cid was one told by Spanish minstrels and bards 
called juglares. It was a well known story throughout Spanish cities and 
towns as it was told in town squares across the land; each bard had a 
different interpretation for the tale.  It is also believed that there 
was an actual Cid de Castilla who took the kingdom of Valencia from 
Moorish rule through certain artifacts that were found in Valencia.  
Some people claim that they found his two mythical swords La Tizona and 
La Colada which he used to slay actual Moorish kings. The whole story 
was written down by Miguel de Cervantes and the music score was done by 
Miklos Rosza.  By the way, Cid is Final Fantasy's most-used character. 
He's in FF2j, FF2US, FF5j, FF3, FF7, and FFT. Wow! ^^

<p><b>Namingway</b> and the tribe of <b>Humingways</b> probably got 
their names from twentieth-century American writer Ernest Hemingway. 

<p>The <b>Four Fiends</b> in this game are all demons who show up in 
Dante's <i>Inferno</i>.  In the story, Dante and the Roman poet Virgil 
make a journey through the nine circles of Hell.  The book was written 
around the beginning of the 14th century, and the story takes place on 
Good Friday, 1300.  Three of the Fiends' names are misspelled in the 
American version...  
<ul><li><b>Milon</b>, or <b>Scarmiglione</b> in FFIVj, is one of the 
demons in Malebolge, the eighth circle of Hell.  His name was probably 
shortened to 'Milon' because of space limitations.
<li><b>Rubicant</b> is another demon in Canto XXII.  His name means "he 
who grows red"; appropriate for the Fire Fiend.
<li><b>Kainazzo</b>, a. k. a. <b>Cagnazzo</b> is another demon from the 
same circle. It means, roughly, 'the big Kain'. Another coincidental 
explanation (I thought of this long ago and assumed it to be true ^^;) 
is the Japanese kanji 'kai' (sea) + 'nazo' (mystery).  That's 
coincidental though.
<li><b>Valvalis</b>, a. k. a. <b>Barbariccia</b>: (In Japanese, 'b' and 
'v' sometimes aren't distinguished, like 'r' and 'l'.)  Barbariccia is 
the leader of the ten demons that Virgil and Dante meet when exploring 
Hell.
</li></ul>

<p>One of Kain's strongest spears was called the <b>Gungnir</b>.  This 
was the name of Odin's spear in Norse mythology.  The Gungnir was 
supposed to have always pointed at the strongest member of an enemy 
party, but obviously Kain could fight whomever he wished :)  In <a href="#ff5gungnir">FF5</a> and FF7, when you call Odin, he sometimes uses 
this weapon.

<p>The most powerful bow and arrows were called "<b>Artemis</b>"; 
Artemis is a goddess from Greek myths.  She carried a bow and arrow and 
was also the goddess of fertility.  She was the sister of Apollo, and is 
the subject of the Temple of Artemis, one of the Seven Wonders of the 
Ancient World.  

<p>Another type of arrow was <b>Medusa</b>, named for the woman of Greek 
legend who could turn people to stone by looking at them.  She had 
snakes for hair.

<p>A third bow-arrow combination with a significant name is the Samurai.  
Originally they were named for <b>Yoichi</b> Nagase, a famous figure in 
Japanese history.  It was probably changed because few Americans know 
who he is.  I'll save the longish story for the FFV section, since 
that's where the bow has its name preserved intact.

<p>Enemies: 
<p><b>Arachne</b>: She was a woman who weaved things and was turned into 
a spider by Athena when she lost a bet - thus she's a spider in this 
game (and thus the English word "arachnid"). 

<p>Remember <b>Calbrena</b>, Luca's dolls in the Underground?  The name 
is a shortened form of <b>Calcabrina</b>, another of the ten demons from 
the Inferno.

<p><b>Hydra</b> was a legendary monster with multiple heads. It was said 
that if you cut off one head, another would regenerate to take its 
place. 

<p><b>King-Ryu</b> and <b>Ging-Ryu</b> have names that are a bit 
misleading... they should really be spelled 'Kin-Ryu' and 'Gin-Ryu'.  
They mean (and you'll see why if you look at them) 'gold dragon' and 
'silver dragon' in Japanese.

<p><b>Leviathan</b>: The Leviathan was a legendary sea monster, gigantic 
in size, that would send ships to a watery doom. "Leviathan" is of 
Hebrew origin. 

<p><b>Naga</b>: A Naga is a long-tailed being from Indian legend (they 
show up in FF1 also).  The HugeNaga from the Sealed Cave is <b>Naga 
Rajah</b> originally; it means 'King Naga' and comes from Sanskrit.

<p><b>Ogopogo</b>, the guardian of the Murasame in the lunar core, is 
supopsedly a sea monster that inhabits a lake in Canada.  I don't know 
the details, though.  (The word's a palindrome, too. ^^)

<p>On the moon, you'll find Procyote and Juclyote; these are shortenings 
of <b>Prokaryote</b> and <b>Eukaryote</b>.  These things are extremely 
simple one-celled life forms from which modern complex beings sprang.  
Incidentally, if 'Procyote' were the correct spelling (it isn't, since 
FF4j's katakana make the word clear), it could mean a being from the 
star Procyon.  After Sirius, Procyon is the second brightest star in the 
sky.

<p><b>Wyvern</b>: The Wyvern guarded one of the really powerful weapons 
in the Lunar Subterrane. A Wyvern is a breed of monster; half dragon and 
half eagle. He's called Dark Bahamut in the import, and shows up on the 
Lete River in FF3 also. 

<p>Miscellaneous:
<p><b>The Tower of Babel</b>: Well, this could be related to the Tower 
of Babel. Supposedly humans were building a massive temple, so high that 
it could reach heaven and the humans could then be on a level with God. 
God then punished the humans by forcing the inhabitants of each level to 
speak a different language, and thus nothing could be communicated and 
the tower couldn't be completed.   In fact, the words 'babel' and 
'Babel' come from Aramaic.  Golbez and the Four Fiends were using the 
Tower to reach the moon in FF2, which parallels the humans' quest to 
reach God.

<p><b>Troia</b>  "Troia" is the Latin word for the city of Troy.  The 
site of the Trojan War, subject of Homer's <u>Iliad</u>, Troy is the 
starting point for Ulysses' journeys in the <u>Odyssey</u>.  

<p><b>Chocobos</b> make their first US appearance in this game... they 
<i>might</i> have gotten their name from a chocolate candy which sold in 
Japan a few years back (and is still popular).  It was called 
"Chocoballs" and had a picture of a bird on the front.  But 
unfortunately the bird looks nothing like the familiar yellow chocobo 
that we all know and love... ^_^

<p>In the original Japanese version, there's an item called <i>Soma no 
Shizuku</i>, or <b>Soma Drop</b>.  Soma is a fictional hallucinatory 
drug used in Aldous Huxley's dystopian novel, <i>Brave New World</i>.

<p>Rydia's call monsters: 

<p><b>Shiva</b> is the god of destruction in Hinduism, and has multiple 
hands and scary-looking tusks.  Shiva is in the other two 16-bit FF 
games as well.

<p><b>Asura</b> is also Indian; it was originally spelled "Ashur".  
Ashur was the chief god of war and empire. He was always spoiling for a 
fight, was very mischevious, and was constantly getting in trouble with 
the  other gods. Also, is the origin of the Japanese term "shuraba", 
where everything is so chaotic that you can't tell what's going on 
('shura' from Asura, and 'ba' = place).  Cyan in FF3 has a sword called 
"Ashura". 

<p>A <b>Jinn</b> is a mythical being who could be summoned to influence 
mankind (also spelled "djinn"; actually, "djinni" is one and "djinn" is 
plural). 

<p><b>Indra</b> was the chief of the Vedic gods and controlled rain and 
thunder.  He flew through the sky on his solar chariot.

<p>The <b>Titans</b> were giant beings, encountered by Ulysses on his 
famous ten-year Odyssey returning home from the Trojan War. More on the 
Odyssey later. 

<p>The weapon names aren't really significant but there is the <b>Zeus 
Glove</b>, named for the Greek god Zeus (that's in FF1 also). Zeus is
the father of many of the other gods and reigned atop Mt. Olympus. 
There's also Excalibur which I mentioned before... 

<hr>
<a name="ffa"><p><h3>Final Fantasy Adventure</h3>

<p>This game is also known as Seiken Densetsu (Legend of the Holy Sword) 
and is the prequel to Secret of Mana.  This time, we've got some more 
entries!

<p><b>Glaive</b>, which is the name of the empire and is French for 
"sword".

<p><b>Ammonite</b> - a flat spiral fossilized cephalopod shell (thus all 
the shells on the Ammonite Coast)

<p><b>Julius</b> - The last surviving member of the Vandole Empire, 
Julius wished to use the power of the Mana Tree to revive the Empire.  
Perhaps this is a reference to Julius Caesar?

<p><b>Vandole</b> - The name of the old Empire (and also the name of the 
Emperor in Secret of Mana), it may be a corruption of the word "Vandal," 
the tribe of Germanic people who overran Gaul, Spain, and northern 
Africa in the 4th and 5th centuries and sacked Rome in 455.  This is 
where the modern world "vandal" comes from.

<p><b>Unicorn Water</b> - Water purified by dipping a unicorn's horn 
(alicorn) into it was believed to have healing properties.  Thus the 
Unicorn potion heals all status changes except Moogle (even though the 
instruction booklet says it can).
<hr>
<a name="ffl1"><p><h3>Final Fantasy Legend</h3>
<p><b>Arthur Armor</b> - no doubt a reference to King Arthur

<p><b>Geta Shoes</b> - Geta are a kind of Japanese sandal.

<p><b>O-Bake</b> - Japanese for 'ghost'.  He's the easiest ghost-like 
enemy.

<p><b>Ryu-O</b> - means "dragon king" in Japanese, and that's exactly 
what he is.

<p><b>Sei-Ryu</b> - means "holy dragon" (or "blue dragon") in Japanese, 
but he's actually a villain who banished Ryu-O.

<p><b>Byak-Ko</b> - means "white tiger" in Japanese.

<p>Actually, the Four Fiends in this game (who also make an appearance as
the four elemental Guardians in Wild Arms, and the figures on the Four
Gods Set in FFTactics), are ancient Chinese gods.  They're in the anime
Fushugi Yuugi (spelling?) as well.

<p><i>Return Appearances:</i> the Aegiz Shield (alternate spelling), 
Ashura, Hermes Shoes (also in FF5), Kraken, Lich, Tiamat, and Leviathan 
(all minor enemies).

<hr><p><h3>FF Legend 2</h3>
<p><b>Apollo</b> - God of the sun and also of music (thus Apollon's Harp 
in
FF5)

<p><b>Isis</b> - Egyptian goddess of fertility; wife and sister of 
Osiris.  (More on er in the Osiris entry.)

<p><b>Neptune</b> - The name of the undersea volcano, Neptune is the 
Roman god of the sea.

<p><b>Sleipnir</b> - Odin's battle steed; in the game, an enemy you 
fight with Odin. (There are several others who I can't remember, but 
their names are mythologically significant as well - can anyone else 
remember?  Odin's Crows, or something like that.)

<p><b>Valhalla</b> - The place in Norse mythology where brave warriors 
dwelt after death; Odin's realm both in mythology and in the game.  (And 
if you die in the game, Odin revives you.)

<p><b>Venus</b> - Roman goddess of love and beauty.  (Also a minor enemy 
in FFL3, and the Venus Shield and Venus Key are items in FFMystic 
Quest.)

<p><i>Repeat Appearances:</i> Ashura

<hr><p><h3>FF Legend 3</h3>

<p><b>Arthur</b> - The main hero.  Three guesses as to who he's named 
after, and the first two don't count. :)

<p><b>Anubis</b> - The jackal-headed Egyptian god of death.

<p><b>Cronos</b> - Since FFL3 is all about time travel, having a guy 
named Cronos is rather appropriate.  You meet him as a child in the 
Past, an adult in
the Present, and an old man in the Future.

<p><b>Daimyo</b> - A minor enemy, a daimyo is a warlord of ancient 
Japan.

<p><b>Echidna</b> - A burrowing nocturnal hedgehog-like mammal (for 
those who have played the Sonic games, this will be familiar).

<p><b>Hecate Armor</b> - Hecate was the Greek goddess of the underworld.

<p><b>Loki</b> - Norse god of mischief.

<p><b>Masa</b> - The name of the weaponsmith.  He turns the cursed sword 
"Muramas" into the really great wonderful supreme Masamune.

<p><b>Dr. Pulcer and Dr. Quacer</b> - Perhaps their names refer to 
"pulsar" and "quasar"?  And <i>those</i> terms are abbreviations for 
'pulsating' and 'quasi-stellar' objects.

<p><b>Romulus</b> - One of the legendary founders of Rome, the Romulus 
in this game actually looks more like Cereberus, the three-headed 
guardian of the underworld.

<p><b>Ronin</b> - a masterless samurai.

<p><b>Osiris</b>, <b>Set</b> and <b>Thoth</b> - Three of the Egyptian 
gods.  Set was the evil brother of Osiris, the legendary god-king of 
Egypt who brought the people out of barbarism.  Since everyone loved 
Osiris, Set was determined to kill him, and, with the aid of 72 
accomplices, devised a plot to do him in.  He fashioned a chest of 
precious wood and promised to give it to whomever fit in it, and (since 
it was made to fit Osiris) ended up giving it to his brother, whereupon 
he and his accomplices sealed it shut and threw it into the Nile, 
leaving Osiris to die.  His wife and sister Isis was overwhelmed with 
despair, but Thoth restored her courage and together they gathered the 
parts of his body.  They restored his body, making him the god of the 
dead, but were unable to find his penis, which, by remaining at the 
bottom of the Nile, gave the river its life-giving power.  However, Set 
was avenged by Osiris' son Horus, who defeated him and assumed the 
throne of Egypt.  Set was condemned to carry Osiris' body forever, and 
Thoth collected the pieces of Horus' eye (which was mutilated in the 
fight with Set) and restored it.  Egyptian scribes, presided over by 
Thoth, used the Horus-eye to designate fractions in their writing, and 
the symbol became a good luck talisman.

<p><b>Sol</b> - means "sun".

<p><b>Valkyrie</b> - More Norse mythology, the Valkyries are maidens who 
escorted brave warriors to Valhalla.  (And are also the subject of some 
operas! ^_^)

<p><i>Repeat Appearances:</i> Ashura, Chaos, Dullahan, Garuda, Hermes 
Shoes, Kraken, Sei-Ryu, Thanos (alternate spelling).

<p>FF Mystic Quest was designed for younger players, so maybe that's why 
there aren't as many obscure references in this game.

<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Her name means "moon." She was one of the Titans in 
Greek mythology.

<p><b>Tristam</b>: His name means sorrowful. In the Arthurian legends, 
there is a knight named Tristan or Tristram, the nephew of King Mark 
(hey, that's me) of Cornwall. Tristan fell in love with Mark's bride to 
be, Isolde (Iseult) because of a love potion. This legendary romance is 
the subject of an opera by the great Richard Wagner ("Tristan und 
Isolde" in German). Also baseball Hall of Famer Tris Speaker's real 
first name is "Tristram". 

<p><b>Kaeli</b>: Kaeli Kreider was one of the producers at Squaresoft. 
No myths here. ^_^

<p><b>Pazuzu's Tower</b>:  There was a demon named Pazuzu in 
Mesopotamian myths.

<p><b>Libra Crest</b>: Libra comes from Latin and refers to weight.  
Thus the British pound is symbolized by "L" with a line drawn through 
it, and the pound weight is abbreviated "lb."  The scale is represented 
in the constellation of Libra.

<p>The <b>Mobius Crest</b> is in the design of a Mobius strip, which is 
a one-sided object.  To make one, take a strip of paper (or anything you 
like; I suggest paper because it's easy to get a hold of ^^), give one 
end a <i>half</i> twist, and tape it to the other end.  Notice that you 
can now trace a line around the whole thing without lifting your pencil 
up... this is because it only has one side!  It was discovered about two 
hundred years ago by the German mathematician August M&oumlbius, and 
it's the symbol for infinity.

<p>The enemy <b>Stheno</b> was one of the Gorgons of Greek myth.  The 
other two were Medusa (who's rather famous) and Euryale (who isn't).  
The Gorgons were terrifying dragon-like creatures who could turn people 
to stone just by looking at them.

<p>Also, some of the towns are named for the "Four Elements" of Greek 
science. For example, Windia, Fireburg, and Aquaria obviously relate to 
wind, fire, and water.
<hr>
<p><a name="som"><h3>The Secret of Mana</h3>

<p>Known as FF Gaiden - Seiken Densetsu 2 (FF side story - Legend of 
Holy Sword) in Japan, this is part of the FF series but doesn't contain 
as many interesting historical names as in the main games. Most names 
are puns like "Mushboom", "LA Funk", and "Rabite". But there are a few 
worth mentioning. 

<p>The <b>Mana</b> in the title refers to life force or power, and is 
Polynesian in origin.  There's another word, "manna"; the bread that 
fell from the sky in the Bible, saving Moses and the Israelites from 
starvation.

<p>The main characters have names in the Japanese orginal, <b>Seiken 
Densetsu 2</b>, and they're <b>Randi</b> (the boy), <b>Purim</b> (the 
girl), and <b>Popoi</b> (the sprite).  <b>Purim</b> is a Jewish festival 
that commemorates the deliverance of the Persian Jews from destruction 
under Xerxes I, as recorded in the book of Esther.  A very important 
holiday.

<p><b>Neko</b>, the cat who shows up everywhere to sell you stuff, is 
just Japanese for "cat".

<p>And here are the eight elemental sprites:
<ul><li><b>Salamando</b> comes from salamander, a fire lizard which, in 
Egyptian hieroglyphics, is represented by a human form pinched to death 
with the cold.  It would use the coldness of its body to quench the fire 
that it lived in.  The word derives from Greek "salamandria".
<li><b>Undine</b> is a water nymph who was created without a soul.  By 
marrying a mortal, she obtained one, and with it all the pains and 
penalties of the human race.  Comes from Latin "unda", meaning wave.
<li><b>Sylphid</b>: The elemental spirits of air.  Only mortals who 
preserve inviolate chastity can become familiar with sylphs.  In the 
Japanese games, they're called <b>Djin</b>, who are fairies in Arabian 
mythology.  They live in the mountains and can take many forms, 
including those of humans.  Supposedly, they were created from fire two 
thousand years before Adam.
<li><b>Gnome</b> is an elemental spirit of Earth.  Usually they take a 
human-like form, only smaller and, some would say, slightly uglier.  
Gnomes were said to be very wise, and their name comes from Greek 
"gnoma", meaning "knowledge".
<li><b>Shade</b> just refers to darkness.
<li><b>Lumina</b> comes from the Latin for "light"; thus Lumina is the 
light elemental.
<li><b>Luna</b>: Comes from the Latin for "moon". That's why you get 
"Moon Energy", "Lunar Magic", etc. from Luna. It's the root word in 
English "lunar", "lunatic", etc. 
<li><b>Dryad</b>: A Dryad is a wood nymph; thus SoM's "Dryad" appears as 
a tree. The word "dryad" comes from the Greek for "oak" or "tree". 
Dryads are attached to specific trees, and they die when the tree dies. 
Thus, SoM's Dryad was of the Mana Tree. </li></ul>

<p>The king in the Gold City is named "<b>Mammon</b>"... supposedly 
Mammon represents greed and lust for riches, which is certainly 
appropriate for the gold city in SoM... Mammon sometimes is represented 
as a tree. Incidentally, on "The Simpsons", Monty Burns' mansion is at 
the corner of "Mammon" (which we just mentioned) and "Croesus" streets 
(the rich king of Lydia; see Rydia's <a href="#ff2rydia">FF2 entry</a>) 
- 1001 Mammon Lane, I think :).

<p>The <b>Pure Land</b>: In Buddhist mythology, the Pure Land was a 
heaven-like place. Supposedly all the beings live in harmony there; just 
the opposite of this game in which you're attacked by fearsome monsters.

<p><b>Mandala</b>, one of the towns, is a kind of Buddhist tapestry.  
Also, there's a peak called Puncak Mandala (height: 4760 m) in the Moake 
mountains.

<p><b>Karon</b>: This should actually be spelled "Charon" (pronounced 
"karon"). In Greek legend, the dead travel down the river Styx on their 
way to Hades, the underworld. Ulysses passed by here during the Odyssey. 
The name of the boatman is Charon; thus he's the ferryman in the game, 
to the Moon Palace where you get Luna (see below). Hades is also known 
as Pluto, thus when it was discovered that the outermost planet Pluto 
had a moon, it was given the appropriate name Charon. 

<p><b>Thanatos</b>: Thanatos is the Greek word for "death". So it makes 
sense that Thanatos wanted to inhabit the bodies of the living. And the 
Greek personification of death was "Thantos" (only one 'a'). 

<p><b>Jabberwocky</b>: A poem by Lewis Carroll. Famous for the words 
that Carroll decided to invent while writing it, like "brillig" and 
"mimsy" :) The dragon in this poem was called the Jabberwock.

<p><b>Kilroy</b>: Kilroy may or may not be a real person. Around the 
time of the First World War, a soldier in the U.S. Army went around 
writing 'Kilroy was here!' in all kinds of weird places, just to prove 
that he could get there first. (The army had a reputation for being 
first in everything). So SoM's Kilroy <i>might</i> have been named for 
him; I can't think of anybody else named Kilroy...

<p><b>Boreal Face</b>: This might be related to Boreas, the son of 
Titans Astraeus and Eos.  (Same for Borras in FF3.)  "Boreal" also can 
be used to mean "northern".

<p><b>Garuda Buster</b> (L. 8 Bow):  The Garuda Bow is probably named 
for Garuda, the bird that Vishnu rode on in Hindu legend.  Garuda is the 
king of all birds and supposedly can carry several gods without 
impediment.  Garuda represents good, and can sense evil in its vicinity.

<p><b>Valkyrian</b> (L. 8 Javelin): The Valkyries were Odin's messengers 
(Odin again?). Wagner's famous music piece, "Ride of the Valkyries", is 
about them coming down the mountain. It's heard in "Der Ring des 
Nibelungen" (The Ring of the Nibelung), which includes Siegfried from 
FF3. More on him in the FF3 section. 

<p><b>Griffin Claw</b>:  A griffin was a beast, half eagle and half 
lion. Both these animals had large claws.

<p><b>Claymore</b>:  A Scottish sword.  Supopsedly it's the one wielded 
by the Highlander.  Also, there's a team in the World League of American 
Football called the Scottish Claymores.

<p><b>Chakra Hand</b>: A "chakra" is any one of the seven psychic 
centers of the body representing passion, pleasure, majesty, love, 
purity, inner sight, and thought. They occur wherever twelve lines of 
force in the body meet. Derives from ancient Eastern philosophy. 

<p><b>Daedalus Lance</b> (L. 8 Spear): Daedalus was an expert craftsman 
and architect who built the labyrinth of Greek legend. After he 
finished, King Minos locked him in a tower with his son Icarus. They 
then tried to build wings and escape, but that part failed... As for the 
Labyrinth, King Minos put the Minotaur (a horrible monster) in there to 
kill wanderers, and when Theseus was imprisoned, Ariadne helped him to 
get out... but that's another story. 
<p>... which we'll get to shortly, because the Minotaur appears in...

<hr>
<p><a name="ff5"><h3>Final Fantasy 5</h3>

<p>This game was never released in the US, but it's certainly as 
interesting and fun as other Square games!  If you've got FF5 and are 
looking for an English translation, look <a href="http://www.rpgamer.com/">here.</a>.  ^_^  There are plenty of 
historical names here, though not nearly as many as in the more recent 
FF3.  I highly recommend this game, though you really need to read kana 
(Japanese phonetic characters) at least, and hopefully some kanji, if 
you want to make any progress.  The mythological names have their usual 
wide range of origins.  A lot of names are repeated in FF4, 5, and 6. 

<p><b>Characters:</b>

<p><b>Gilgamesh</b>: He was a legendary hero in Mesopotamian culture.  
In the library of Nineveh, there exist 12 slabs on which are written the 
exploits of Gilgamesh.  The real Gilgamesh ruled Uruk in the 3d 
millennium BC, and later his tale was embellished to the point where 
Gilgamesh was a hero of legendary magnitude.  Supposedly he was rather 
harsh as king, and so the god Anu created a wild man named <b>Enkidu</b> 
to stop him.  However, Enkidu became the companion and servant of 
Gilgamesh after the two men had a test of their strength.  There are 
many stories about the two of them; in one, they travel to defeat the 
forest guardian Humbaba (a. k. a. Huwawa); in another, Gilgamesh rejects 
a marriage propposal from Ishtar, the love goddess.  Later Enkidu dies 
and Gilgamesh learns the location of a plant that granted eternal youth 
from Utnaphistim, survivor of the great flood.  But a serpent steals it 
and Gilgamesh dies.  The epic ends with the spirit of Enkidu promising 
to recover the objects that Ishtar gave to Gilgamesh.  In FF5, Gilgamesh 
has a partner named <b>Enkidou</b>; surely this is the Enkidu from 
legend.  Also, you can steal Genji equipment from Gilgamesh, so try to 
get this if you can.

<p>The Dark Mage <b>Exdeath</b>: This name just means "exceeding death".  
In the game, Exdeath is trying to obtain the power of "mu" ("void") so 
that he can rule the world.

<p><b>Enemies:</b>
<p><b>Archaeo Eibis</b> (Arukeo Eibisu): The boss of the Lonka ruins.  
The study of ancient ruins is "archaeology", and an ibis is a kind of 
bird.  There's also "<b>Sea Ibis</b>" and "<b>Tot Eibisu</b>" which 
could either mean "Death Ibis" ('Tod' (rhymes with boat) is German for 
'death') or "Toth Ibis" (as in the Egyptian god who kept balance in the 
world). Also "<b>Jura Eibis</b>" may be related to the Jurassic period 
in history, which is in turn named for the Jura mountains in 
Switzerland.

<p><b>Byblos</b> (Biburosu): You meet him in the Ancient Library. Makes 
sense since his name is derived from the Greek for "book". The French, 
German, and Russian words for "library" (and perhaps several others) are 
all cognates, related to the Greek.  FF5's Ancient Library is patterned 
after the one in Alexandria, and the two most famous books there were 
"Byblos" and "Almagest".

<p><b>Catoblepas</b>:  A catoblepas is supposedly a being who lives in 
the forests and can turn enemies to stone merely by glancing at them.  
Well, this is just what he does in FF5.  His attack is called "Akuma no 
Hitomi" which means "Devil's Eye".

<p><b>Farfarello</b>, who shows up in the forest part of the Cleft of 
Dimension, is another demon from Dante's Inferno.  Some of the others 
are the Four Fiends in <a href="#ff2">FF2</a>.

<p>The <b>Furies</b>:  In FF5 you meet the Furies in the Castle of 
Dimension.  The Furies were old crones sent by the gods to punish 
people. Supposedly, they carried whips with thorns on them.

<p><b>Gargoyles</b>: Stone statues that are frequently seen near 
entrances to buildings.  They guard the entrances to the places where 
the slabs are located.  Some old European castles would have gargoyles 
above the door to ward off evil spirits.  Goyles and Red Goyles are in 
FF1 also.

<p><b>Halicarnassus</b>: One of the bosses of the Cleft of Dimension. 
The name probably comes from the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, which was 
built in what is now Turkey around 350 BC.  It was built for Carian king 
Mausolus; thus the English word "mausoleum".  Incidentally, this is 
another Wonder of the Ancient World.

<p><b>Mammon</b>: A tree in the Great Forest of Muah. Mammon was a tree 
that represented greed; it's also the name of the rich king in SoM. (see 
SoM section)

<p><b>Mind Flayer</b>:  One of the last enemies you meet.  He attacks 
with "Mind Blast", which sucks out your brain.  I'm not sure which 
mythology he's from, but supposedly Mind Flayer is one of those truly 
evil beings who has no soul. Also known as "illithid".

<p>The <b>Minotaur</b>:  At the top of the Fork Tower, on the 
"fighting-only" side, you fight Minotauros, a. k. a. Minotaur.  He was 
placed into the Labyrinth of Greek legend in order to stop travellers 
from escaping.

<p><b>Necrophobia</b>:  This just means "fear of death". (not 'fear of 
the night' as I had before)  You fight him in order to open up the last 
save point before the final battle.

<p><b>Wingraptor</b>:  You fight him at the top of the Wind Shrine (Kaze 
no Shinden) just before getting the crystal chips; it's rather early on 
in the game.  A raptor is a bird of prey, and there's a dinosaur called 
"velociraptor".  "Raptor" was hardly a household word until Michael 
Crichton popularized them in his book _Jurassic Park_ a few years ago.

<p><b>Ziggurat Gigas</b>:  You fight him in the tower while trying to 
break the barrier around Exdeath's castle.  A ziggurat is a kind of 
tower; it's also from Mesopotamian culture. I believe that they were 
built by followers of Zoroaster.

<p>Some more heavenly bodies from the solar system... <b>Phobos</b> 
means "fear" and is guarding one of the slabs underground.  It's also 
one of the moons of Mars.  Along with Phobos appears <b>Triton</b>, 
who's king of the seas and one of Neptune's moons, as is <b>Nereid</b>.

<p>Some weapons...
<a name="ff5gungnir"><p>The <b>Gungnir</b>:  In FF2 (US), when you 
called Odin, either he would destroy the enemies completely or nothing 
would happen.  But in FF5, Odin has two different attack styles.  One is 
"Zantetsuken" (Iron Cutting Sword) which slices everyone up and the 
other is Gungnir, which only damages one enemy.  Gungnir is the name of 
Odin's spear.  Supposedly, the Gungnir always pointed at the strongest 
member of the opposition but I'm not sure if this holds true in FF5.  
Does anybody know?

<p><b>Trident</b>: A spear for the Dragoon. It's a large three-pronged 
fork wielded by the sea god Poseidon.

<p><b>Sasuke's Katana</b>: Sasuke is a legendary ninja's name, Sarutobi 
Sasuke.

<p><b>Orichalcon</b>: *Could* be related to "orichalcum", the legendary 
alloy of Atlantis which was said to have special properties. In FF5, 
Orihalcon is a knife; it's in Seiken Densetsu 3 too.

<p><b>Main Gauche</b>: This is French for "left hand".  It's a knife 
with some defense ability.  But, since all the characters in FF5 are 
ambidextrous, you can equip it in either hand.

<p><b>Thor's Hammer</b>:  Also known as "Mjolnir", Thor's Hammer could 
instantly kill any giant (they were the enemies of the gods, with whom 
they battle at Ragnarok) and never missed.  Thor could throw it at the 
enemies and it would return to him, as it does in FF5.  Also I've heard 
that a lightning bolt is emitted from Mjolnir as it is thrown... this 
would explain the "LIT2" magic cast by it in FF1.

<p><b>Hermes' Shoes</b>:  Hermes comes from Greek mythology and wore
magical winged sandals which allowed him to fly.  Hermes was also the god of 
thieves and gamblers and could teleport and make himself invisible as 
well as fly.

<p><a name="ff5yoichi"><b>Yoichi's Bow</b>: OK, for this one, let's pass 
the mike to FF5 grand master Tat Nakao... [Tat:  Maybe it was the name 
of the person who shot the arrow at the battle of Genpei.  I think it 
was in "Ougi no Mato".  Mato = Target, and Ougi = fan.  The simple story 
was that Genji was fighting against Heike at Seto Naikai (the Inland 
Sea), and Heike was on the sea and Genji was on the shore (maybe it was 
the other way around).  Since the sun began to fall, the one on the sea 
thought to have entertainment.  They let one woman with one pole aboard 
the small boat (and this pole had Ougi (fan) at the tip).  She rowed the 
boat near the shore and asked someone on the shore to shoot the fan.  
And I think Yoichi was nominated to do so, and he did it.  I *THINK* 
this person was Yoichi, but I'm not sure....  It was 8th grade that I 
learned this in school.  (And I wasn't good at Kokugo)] 

<p>Some Egyptian stuff:  In the game, there's a <b>Pyramid</b> just like 
the ones that the ancient Egyptians built for their dead pharaohs.  Also 
there's a city named "<b>Karnak</b>" which is near the Ancient Library.  
In Egypt, there was a real city named Karnak, and it might have been 
near the city of Alexandria, home of the Great Library of Alexandria.

<p><b>Sekhmet</b> shows up in the Pyramid. She's a lion-headed goddess 
sent by Ra to punish mankind for its sins.  Part of the triad that 
includes Bast (cat goddess) and Ra (the rather important sun god).

<p><b>Other stuff:</b>
<p><b>Almagest</b>: The name of Neo-Exdeath's special attack in the 
final battle.  About a thousand years ago, Ptolemy wrote a book about 
astronomy, and when it was translated into Arabic, they called it the 
Almagest ('al' is Arabic 'the', and 'magest' comes from Greek; the whole 
thing means 'the greatest'). But it was hardly the greatest, since it 
put Earth at the center of the solar system :)  In fact, the original 
edition was located in the Great Library of Alexandria, just like FF5's 
Ancient Library.

<p>The castle of <b>Tycoon</b>: Lenna's home. A tycoon is someone with a 
lot of money.  In fact, the English word "tycoon" comes from the 
Japanese "taikun" (meaning prince), but in Japanese, that word isn't 
spelled the same way as FF5's "Tycoon".

<p><b>Adamant</b> from FF1 is in this game as well. In fact Adamant is a 
regular word; it's a synonym for "extremely hard". (that is, hard like a 
diamond, not "difficult".)

<p><b>Moogles</b> made their first appearance in FF3j (where, strangely 
enough, they spoke Jaanese normally), and in this game they begin saying 
their famous "Kupo!" ^_^;  In Japanese, they're called "Moguri", and 
that comes from a combination of the Japanese words "mogura" (mole) and 
"koumori" (bat).  And doesn't Mog look like a mole with little bat 
wings? :)

<p>If you use the Chemist and mix items, certain combinations lead to 
<b>Samson Power</b>, which, as you may be able to guess, gives the 
recipient great strength.  It's named for the biblical character who was 
legendary for his muscle power.  Samson, like Edgar and the Nordic gods 
in FF3, is the subject of an opera -- <i>Samson et Dalila</i>, written 
in 1869 by Camille Saint-Saens.

<p>Some stuff from FF5 that I'm not sure of: Twin Tania and Karlabos... 
can anyone identify these??

<hr>
<p><a name="ff3"><h3>Final Fantasy 3</h3>

 <p>There are so many in this game. Most of the Espers, many of the 
items, and a few of the enemies have historical/mythological
names. It seems that in FF3 the Square geniuses went out of their way to 
impress us with mythological references. First, some enemies: 

<p><b>Actaneon</b> is probably a variant spelling of "actinia", a kind 
of sea anemone.  It comes from the Greek for "ray".

<p><b>Apokryphos</b> is on the Floating Continent.  Its name comes from 
Greek for "hidden".  This is the origin of the English word 
"apocryphal", which means "almost certainly fictional".

<p><b>Aquila</b> is Spanish for 'eagle'.  Also, <b>Lobo</b> is Spanish 
for 'wolf'.

<p><b>Cephaler</b> comes from the same root as 'cephalopod' and is the 
class of octopi and squids.

<p><b>Dark Side</b>:  Shows up in the mines of Narshe.  <i>Maybe</i> 
this has something to do with "the Force" in the Star Wars movies; Darth 
Vader is on the Dark Side.

<p><b>Dullahan</b>: The "boss" of Daryl's Tomb.  Dullahan is from Irish 
mythology, and is a headless spirit that wanders around Ireland, holding 
his head under his arm and driving a black coach drawn by headless 
horses!  He knocks on people's doors, and hurls a bucket of blood in 
their faces!  As you can probably guess, a visit from Dullahan is 
considered to be a portent of death.

<p><b>Eland</b> shows up not only on the Veldt in FF3, but on the "real" 
veld in Africa.  It's a big antelope with horns.

<p><b>Fortis</b> (in Kefka's tower) comes from Latin and means strength 
or power.

<p><b>Garm</b>: In Nordic myths, Garm is a dog who is killed by Tyr at 
Ragnarok.

<p><b>Hidon</b>: Now this name is interesting!  It's the same in both 
the Japanese and American games, but has two completely diferent 
meanings.  In the English version, Gungho says something about "as his 
name implies," referring to the word 'hide' embeded in 'Hidon'.  In the 
Japanese version, however, 'Hidon' brings to mind the word 'hidoi', 
which means 'terrible' or 'scary'.  A nice coincidence!

<p><b>Humpty</b>, in the Figaro cave, probably comes from the poem, 
"Humpty Dumpty". ^_-

<p><b>Intangir</b>'s name probably comes from 'intangible'... he's 
pretty hard to hit!

<p><b>Io</b>: A baddie in this game; also the name of Jupiter's volcanic 
moon. Jupiter's four lovers included Io, Europa, Callisto, and Ganymede 
- they're immortalized as Jupiter's four largest moons. It should be 
pronounced "EE-oh", but you also hear "EYE-oh".

<p><b>Lethal Weapon</b>: I don't know... maybe named for the movie 
starring Mel Gibson and Danny Glover? :)

<p><b>Lunaris</b>: Shows up on the gravel-like land near Albrook in the 
World of Ruin.  Means, approximately, "from the moon".

<p><b>Nastidon</b> is just a combination of "nasty" and "mastodon".

<p><b>Osteosaur</b>, who's in Daryl's tomb, comes from Greek for "bone 
lizard".

<p><b>Over Mind</b>:  You meet them in the Phantom Forest.  The name was 
probably inspired by Arthur C. Clarke's novel _Childhood's End_, in 
which there's a great being that transcends physical bodies.  Eventually 
the human race is absorbed by the Overmind, and becomes one with it.

<p><b>Pandora</b>: Shows up inside Cyan's soul. In Greek mythology, 
Pandora was the one who opened the box which released all the evils 
inside it out into the world. (Yet one good thing remained: hope.)  
Remember in FF3 when you first meet Banon and he tells a story like 
this?  He mistakenly says that a man opens the box.

<p><b>Phunbaba</b>:  He is probably the very same 'Humbaba' from the 
Gilgamesh story (in the FF5 section).  They're spelled the same way in 
Japanese; probably the translators had never heard of Humbaba and so 
they arbitrarily picked the spelling 'Phunbaba'.  And no, I don't know 
if the Humbaba of legend attacked with 'Baba Breath' ^_^

<p><b>Primordite</b> means "ancient", like the English word 
"primordial".

<p><b>Prometheus</b>: Though he's a rather insignificant enemy in FF3, 
he was pretty important in Greek mythology. Supposedly Prometheus 
created humans, and then stole fire from Mount Olympus in order to save 
them from freezing. But Zeus didn't like this and Prometheus was 
imprisoned. Later, though, Hercules frees him. Also if you've played CT, 
this name might be familiar! 

<p><b>Scullion</b>, in Kefka's Tower, is an Old English word which 
refers to a maid or servant who washes dishes and things.  A nice word 
for one of Kefka's minions, but "real" scullions don't have lasers and 
missiles, now do they?

<p><b>Telstar</b>: You fight Telstar in the imperial camp. Telstar was 
the name of the satellite which broadcast programs across the entire 
world beginning in 1961. 

<p><b>Templar</b>: The Knights Templar  came into existence in 1119, and 
their symbol was a crown, with two crossed swords behind it.  They were 
dedicated to the protection of those in the crusades.  Their order was 
destroyed when King Philip the Fair had the Grand Master at the time 
executed for refusing to disclose the location of the Templar's 
treasuries and the identities of his members. 

<p><b>Tomb Thumb</b>: Not really mythological, but the name comes from 
"General" Tom Thumb, who was only about three feet tall. He joined P. T. 
Barnum's exhibition in 1842 and went on tour in the U. S. and Europe 
from 1844 to 1847. The "Tomb" part is of course a pun.

<p><b>Whelk</b>:  A whelk is an extremely large sea snail.  It can grow 
to a size of 16 inches.

<p>These next few are in the Japanese FF6...
 <p> <b>Satan</b> (in the cave that leads to Figaro in World of Ruin): 
The Devil himself!  But actually, Satan is a rather minor enemy in FF6j.
 <p> <b>Al-Jabr</b> (in Cayenne's dream):  The English word 'algebra' is 
derived from this word. It's the first word in the title "Al-jabr w'al 
muqabalah" (did I spell that right?) which means roughly "taking away 
and restoring"; referring to algebraic operations... so maybe al-Jabr 
would refer to 'taking away', meaning that he takes your life away... 
I'm not sure, though.
<p> <b>Aspidochelon</b> is called <b>Aspik</b> in FF3.  But that ruins 
the name, since it comes from Greek "aspidion" (a small round shield) 
and "chelon" (hard shell).
<p> <b>Vareole</b> comes from "variola", which means smallpox.
<p> <b>Epiornis</b>, aka Aepyornis, is a gigantic ostrich-like bird 
found in a fossil state in Madagascar.
<p> <b>Goeteia</b> is Greek for "witchcraft".
<p> <b>Sapotender</b>, which gives you a bunch of Magic Points and GP,  
is a combination of Japanese "sapoten" (cactus) and "pretender".  In the 
US, it's <b>Cactrot</b>, which would come from cactus and...??
<p> <b>Brachioreidos</b> comes from Greek "brachys" (short) and "oura" 
(tail).  It's a crab-like creature, and our crabs are in the class 
Brachyoura.
<p> <b>Invisible</b> is a bad guy in Gogo's cave who (of all things) 
turns himself invisible.  Since this would be too obvious in English, 
they changed his name to <b>Covert</b>.
<p>The Dream Stooges are named <b>So&ntildeo</b>, <b>Sue&ntildeo</b>, 
and <b>Reve</b>.  All three of these refer to sleeping and dreaming in 
Spanish and French.
 <p> Plus a few more that sound sort of laughable in English, like 
"Highway", "Death Penalty" (I think he's "Allo Ver" in FF3), 
"Virginity", and "Doubt". :)

<p>Miscellaneous...
<p>The <b>Veldt</b>: A grassy plain with a few shrubs, usually found in 
Africa, is called a veld or veldt. It's derived from the Dutch for 
'field', and came into English by way of Afrikaans. For example, former 
president Roosevelt's name means 'rose-field'. 

<p><b>Lagomorph</b>:  All of the non-winning combinations in Setzer's 
"Slot" result in "Lagomorph"; a rabbit then runs onto the screen and 
gives the characters some HP.  Well, Lagomorphia is an order in biology 
which contains rabbits.  So it's just a fancy name for "rabbit".  
Incidentally, in FF6j Lagomorph is called "Mysidian Rabbit", like the 
city in FF2.

<p>Main Characters: 

<p><b>Locke Cole</b>: Could be named after John Locke, a philospher 
whose beliefs were instrumental in shaping America's early history. 
There's also the obvious pun on the word "lock" - you need him to unlock 
the doors in Narshe - and in that vein, there's a company named "Cole" 
that produces keys!

<p><b>Setzer</b>: OK, here's some more speculation. "Setzer" by itself 
means "typesetter" (hardly a meaningful name). But the German expression 
used when betting on numbers or horses is "setzen"! For example, "10 
Mark auf Nummer 23 setzen" means "bet 10 Marks on number 23". So 
"Setzer" could imply "the one who puts down the money -> "gambler"; 
though I've never heard the word "Setzer" used to mean "gambler". 
Anyway, it's still nice-sounding even if it's a coincidence. It's my 
single favorite character name in the entire FF series. 

<p><b>Terra</b>: Her name means "earth". Could have something to do with 
her being the link between the Earth and the Esper world...?  But also, 
there was a building named "Terra Firm" located just outside the Square 
offices in Washington... maybe Ted Woolsey looked out the window and 
thought, "Hmmm....?

<p><b>Daryl</b> - Her name means "well-loved." Appropriate for her 
relationship with Setzer. Here are some more of the main characters' 
name etymologies, thanks to Kate Malloy (so she's the "I" in the next 
few entries). 
<p><b>Edgar Figaro</b> - His name is of Teutonic origin. I've seen it 
defined as either "wealthy gentleman" (he is a king) or "fortunate 
spear" (the spear is his best weapon) There is also an opera called 
"Edgar," so he's got a double operatic name. The famous opera "The 
Marriage of Figaro" features music by Mozart.
<p><b>Sabin</b> - His name is of Italian origin. It comes from the 
Sabine tribe. According to legend, the Roman settlers kidnapped all of 
the Sabine women. (That part has nothing to do with Sabin.) The name is 
more common in Europe in the feminine form, Sabine. His middle name, 
Rene, means "reborn" and is also more common in the feminine form. Also 
there was a biologist named Sabin, who was responsible for curing a 
muscle virus.  And Sabin's muscles look pretty tough, right?
<p><b>Celes Chere</b> - Celes's last name is French and means "dear." 
Her first name could be related to "celestial", or heavenly, which would 
be in contrast to Terra's "earth".
<p><b>Gau</b> - Back in the times of the Romans, France was known as 
Gaul. There were tribes of wild men living in the north. They might have 
been called Gaus, or Gauls. 
<p><b>Gogo</b> - In the play "Waiting for Godot," there is a character 
named Estragon, nicknamed Gogo. 
<p><b>Cyan Garamonde</b> - "Monde" means "world" in French; I've no clue 
about the "Gara" part. (It could be "train station" in French??) Also 
there was a famous typesetter named Garamonde.  The font named for him 
is used in Apple's manuals. (that has nothing to do with Cyan, of course 
:)
<p><b>Elayne</b> - Elaine was the "Lily Maiden" of Arthurian legend. She 
was related to several important people (Lancelot, I think, was one) and 
when she died, she was sent out to sea in a funeral barge. In fact, she 
is the mother of Galahad in T. H. White's "The Once and Future King".
<p><b>Owain</b> - Uwain was one of Arthur's knights <i>and</i> a king in 
the English legends.  He was Gawain's brother and he ruled the kingdom 
for a time.

<p><b>Billy</b>: In FF6j, <b>Baram</b> (from Shadow's dreams) is called 
Billy.  Since he's a train robber, maybe his name was inspired by Billy 
the Kid, famous outlaw from the American Old West? Also Shadow's real 
name is <b>Clyde</b>, like one half of the famous pair of outlaws 
"Bonnie and Clyde".  Also, in Bret Harte's story <u>The Outcasts of 
Poker Flat</u>, there was a thief named Billy Setzer (!) who gets kicked 
out of town.

<p><b>Vicks</b> and <b>Wedge</b>, the two soldiers from the Empire, are 
characters in the famous 1977 George Lucas film "Star Wars".  They're 
pilots for the rebel alliance.  But in actuality, Vicks should be 
<b>Biggs</b>... supposedly copyright infringement prevented Biggs from 
keeping his name. ^^;

<p><b>Siegfried</b> ('ziek-friet): Named for the hero of the legendary 
German tale of the Ring of the Nibelung. (This was the story upon which 
Richard Wagner based his opera, which contains many famous music pieces 
including "The Ride of the Valkyries". Trust me, you've heard some of 
these before.) Incidentally, Siegfried literally means "victory" (Sieg) 
and "peace" (Friede).
<p>	<h5>Here's a short summary of Siegfried's story:</h5> The god Wotan 
(aka the very familiar <b>Odin</b>) wanted to reclaim the Ring of the 
Nibelung and tried to use the hero Siegfried to do it. Siegfried's body 
was invulnerable except for his shoulder blades, and he could talk to 
animals. He was born and raised in a forest and proved his heroism by 
killing Fafner, the evil dragon.  The sword he used was made by a dwarf 
named Regin, and the idea that dwarves make the best weapons (which 
frequently pops up in these games) came from this mythology.  But he 
ends up getting killed and his beloved Brunnhilde kills herself in the 
end. (That's in one version of the story; in another, he and Brunnhilde 
survive Ragnarok and repopulate the world.) 

<p>Here are the origins of all 28 <b>Espers</b> (including Yura, who 
doesn't really count ^^)... Esper itself is a made-up word, but it might 
be related to "hope" (from French; 'a hope' is 'un espoir') or someone 
who has extra-sensory perception (an ESP-er)...

<p><b>Alexander</b>: Might have been named either for the Russian czar 
of the 1800s or the Macedonian conqueror of the 4th century BC.

<p><b>Bahamut</b>: Bahamut's either the mythical King of the Dragons or 
a fish that holds up the world.  See the <a href="#ff1baham">"Bahamut" 
entry</a> in FF1 for the whole story.

<p><b>Bismark</b>: Could be named for the Prussian ruler of the late 
1800s, Otto von Bismarck.  There was a battleship named for him which 
was sunk in 1941; this could be the inspiration for the effect of the 
Bismarck Esper, "Sea Song".

<p><b>Carbunkl</b>: A carbuncle is a dark red gem resembling a garnet. 
In an Arthurian legend, a knight was on a quest to retrieve three 
things, and one was a carbuncle belonging to a princess.  A carbuncle is 
<i>different</i> from a ruby, so FF5 and FF6j's "Ruby Light" (name of 
Carbuncle's attack) is technically incorrect.

<p><b>Fenrir</b>:  Also known as the Fenris Wolf.  In Nordic mythology, 
the dwarves gave the gods a magical rope which they used to chain Fenrir 
up in Asgard.  Being the child of Loki, the Fenris Wolf was unchained at 
Ragnarok to do battle with the gods.  This is where Odin meets his doom; 
Fenrir eats him.

<p><b>Golem</b>: Jewish mythology tells us that a golem is a creature 
made out of mud and brought to life when a riteous person inscribes a 
certain word on it.  They are destroyed by rubbing out one of the 
letters, making the word "fire" which dries mud and makes the golem fall 
apart. 

<p><b>Ifrit</b>: Originally spelled "Efreet".  Efreeti are fire djinns 
from the elemental plane of fire who lived in the City of Brass.

<p><b>Jihad</b> (Crusader in FF3US) - In the original FF6 this Esper was 
called Jihad. Jihad means sort of like "crusade", thus the English name 
"Crusader". Sometimed "Jihad" is translated as "holy war". The reason 
the name was changed for the US version is probably that some Americans 
think of the group Islamic Jihad when they hear the name. But in 
reality, Jihad doesn't imply anything evil. 

<p><b>Kirin</b>: Kirin is a province in northeasten China, and also the 
name of a city in that province, a city on the Sungari River. This isn't 
to be confused with the Japanese "kirin" (which means giraffe).  Also 
there's a being called a "qilin" in Chinese myths. It's an imaginary 
creature that is part horse and part dragon.  The male is called "Ki", 
and the female is called "Rin".  It is capable of flying, and sparks of 
lightning shoot out from its hooves. Kirin live for 1000 years and are 
considered good luck.  Supposedly Genghis Khan was planning to invade 
India when his scouts happened upon a green talking qilin; the qilin 
convinced Khan to end his war plans.  A famous legend surrounding 
K'i-lin was that one came to a woman named Yen Chen-tsai and gave her a 
jade tablet.  On this tablet was a prophecy that she would become the 
mother of a "throneless king."  Yen Chen-tsai would have a son, 
Confucius, who never ruled China, but accomplished quite a lot.  Actually,
a "kirin" is different from a "quilin" and a "k'i-lin"; it's a messenger
from the gods, a small being about the size of a dog, but is has a mane of
fire.

<p><b>Maduin</b>: Originally spelled "Mael Duin." (but "Madin" in FF6j) 
Mael Duin is a major hero of Irish Mythology.  Son of Ailill, he was 
raised by nuns after his father was killed by raiders.  When told his 
father's story,  Mael Duin sets out with sixteen warriors to avenge his 
death, and his subsquesent voyages have been called the "Irish Odyssey."

<p><b>Odin</b>: The number-one Norse god, the god of thunder, war, 
wisdom, and honor. One of the three sons of Borr, he was the most noble 
and is the father of some of the other Norse gods. Thus he can slice up 
just about anybody as a callable monster in FF2 and as a Esper in FF3.  
He also makes an appearance in FF5 as a call monster and has "Gungnir" 
in addition to his usual slash attack. (See the Odin entry in the FF5 
section.)

<p><b>Palidor</b>: Might refer to a paladin; a knight like Cecil from 
FF2.  It's called "Ke-tsuhari-" in FF6j... what the heck is that!? 
"Kate's Hurry", maybe?? Someone help me on this one ^_^

<p><b>Phantom</b>: A phantom is a spirit or illusion.  So it makes sense 
that Phantom turns your party invisible.

<p><b>Phoenix</b>: The Esper in FF3 that Locke searches for in order to 
bring his beloved Rachel back to life. The "Phoenix" was supposedly a 
legendary bird that rose from the ashes of death every 500 years. Thus 
the Phoenix Esper is related to the resurrection of dead characters. 

<p><b>Raiden</b>: "Raiden" can mean "thunder" (rai, as in 'kaminari') 
and "Lightning" (den, 'electricity') in Japanese, but in FF6j it's 
"Raijin". Raijin is the god of thunder. But... Raijin can also mean 
"fast-moving thunder", and that's how it's spelled in the FF series. (I 
didn't think this name was *that* complicated...)

<p><b>Ragnarok</b>: "Ragnarok" refers to the end of the world in Nordic 
myths. It's like the day of reckoning in which all are judged for their 
actions.  The gods knew that someday they would have to battle their 
nemeses, the giants.  Odin and many of the gods are killed (Odin is 
eaten by Fenrir) and a new world rises from the old world's ashes.  In 
fact, in one version of the story it's Siegfried and Brunnhilde who 
repopulate the world. 
<p>Here's how to pronounce "Ragnar&oumlk" in original Swedish, thanks to 
Zimeon Lundstrom.
<p>	Oh my, difficult. Let me see... Swedish is rather like German I'd 
say, but the German sounds are more hard. First of all, the Swedish "r" 
might be difficult to pronounce, and I don't think i can describe it 
here without the sound itself, so go for the english "r" for the time. 
The first "a" is like the "u" in english "hung". The next "g" is an "ng" 
sound, as in "hung". The next "na" is just like it's spelled, the "a" 
sound is the same as the first "a". The "o" with two dots is a tricky 
one. It's a bit like "ea" in "heard", but don't curl your tongue, just 
let it lie still. And form your mouth a litte more round. Hmmm... this 
is impossible. The last "k" anyway, is just a normal "k". So it would 
come out as "rungnareark", to come as close as possible without creating 
sounds that don't exist in English... In fact, there should be two dots 
on the "o" in Ragnar&oumlk. 

<p><b>Ramuh</b>: Could be Rama, the hero of an epic Indian poem, the 
Ramayana.  He is handsome, brave, and a model individual. After many 
trials and tribulations, he becomes king, and it is revealed that Rama 
is actually the god Vishnu in human form.

<p><b>Seraphim</b>: Comes from the Latin for "angels" - makes sense 
since the Seraphim Esper heals you when you use it. The graphic on the 
screen when you use Seraphim makes even more sense. 

<p><b>Shiva</b>:  Shiva is a god from Indian myths which had multiple 
heads and arms.  Shiva was called "The Destroyer" and had lots of 
powerful weapons.  But in the mythology, Shiva has many other powers 
besides the Ice attribute in Final Fantasy.  A member of the triad that 
includes Vishnu and Brahma.

<p><b>Shoat</b>: A shoat is a young hog weighing between 100 and 180 
pounds. I don't know what this has to do with the game though. But in 
FF6j, Shoat is Catoblepas. Look under "Catoblepas" in the FF5 section.

<p><b>Siren</b>: Well, here's another Odyssey influence. When Ulysses 
and his men sail past the Sirens, their beautiful singing voices tempt 
the men to their doom (thus the musical notes that float across the 
screen). Ulysses escapes the deadly Sirens by inserting beeswax in his 
men's ears so they can keep rowing and not hear the Sirens. He lashes 
himself to the mast of his ship so he won't be able to leave the ship. 

<p><b>Starlet</b> (Lakshmi):  In FF6j, this Esper is called Lakshmi 
(Rakushumi).  Lakshmi is the goddess of good and bad fortune in Indian 
mythology.  She sat on a giant floating lotus watching people.  When she 
looked at you with one eye, it meant that you would have good luck, and 
the other eye meant bad luck.

<p><b>Stray</b>: Probably refers to a stray cat, since the effect is 
called "Cat Rain" and confuses the enemies (causing them to go astray, I 
suppose).  In the Japanese FF6, he's called "Cait Sith" (pronounced 
something like "kett shih"; a figure from Welsh or Irish myth), and is a 
main character in FF7!

<p><b>Terrato</b>:  In FF6j he's Midgarsorm, also known as the Midgard 
Serpent.  (Yet another alias is Iormungandr, also spelled Jormungand.)  
It is an offspring of Loki along with Fenrir.  Living beneath the ocean, 
it encircles the Earth and remains there, waiting for the final battle, 
Ragnarok, where it will help destroy the gods.  Supposedly the only 
weapon capable of hurting Iormungandr is Thor's hammer, Mjolnir.

<p><b>Tritoch</b>: He's called Valigarmanda in FF6j.  Could be related 
to Vali, the Norse god of eternal light and also the world's greatest 
archer.  But otherwise I'm unsure... also, he teaches you Fire 3, Bolt 
3, and Ice 3, which would explain the "tri-" part.

<p><b>Unicorn</b>: A unicorn is a mythical one-horned horse-like animal.  
Unicorns are said to be good luck.  The "Heal Horn" in FF3 is a 
reference to a unicorn's single horn. (The Kirin is a kind of unicorn, 
by the way.)

<p><b>Yura</b>: Just a nickname for "Yuri", a popular Russian male name.  
I think that Yura is the only named Esper that you can't acquire; since 
he doesn't die in the game.

<p><b>ZoneSeek</b>: I don't know how the name relates to the effects, 
but Zone Seek teaches you Rasp and Shell, and casts Shell on your party 
in battle. Maybe the Shell refers to seeking a "safe zone"...?

<p>Some other characters...
<p>The Evil Emperor <b>Gestahl</b> (gesh-'tahl): Well, this name sounds 
a bit like "gestohlen" or "stahl", both of which mean "stole" in German. 
(For grammar experts, "gestohlen" is in perfect tense. "Stahl" the noun 
means steel.) In the original FF6j his name was "<b>Gastra</b>" - but 
they changed it in FF3.

<p><b>Kefka</b>: Well, his name vaguely resembles that of German author 
Franz Kafka. One of his works is entitled "Metamorphosis", and that's 
the effect of the Ragnarok Esper - "Metamorph".  That doesn't have 
anything to do with Kefka though. 

<p><b>El Nino</b> (el 'ni-nyo): One of Mog's dances (literally 'the boy' 
in Spanish; the second n should have a ~ tilde on it). But it also 
refers to a kind of current which creates tropical storms, which makes a 
lot of sense since it's part of the Water Rondo. 

<p>The <b>Lete River</b>, also spelled "Lethe", is the river of oblivion 
in Greek mythology.  It's said that anyone who drinks from its waters 
will forget their past.

<p>Names that are most probably coincidences: 
<p><b>Gau</b> = German "district". 
<p><b>Doma</b> means "homes" in Russian (accent on the "ma") which would 
be nice for a city, but Doma's a castle.  However, Doma (accent on "do") 
is Latin for house, so this may be more relevant. 
<p><b>Cyan</b> is just a fancy word for light blue. (Though in FF6 he's 
called "Cayenne" - a kind of pepper!) 

<p>Names of real people: Aside from Bismarck and Alexander mentioned 
earlier, there's the great Italian writer <b>Dante Alighieri</b>, author 
of the Inferno, the Purgatorio, and Paradiso, who appears as a bad guy 
(his demonsof hell played major parts in FF2US); there's also a baddie 
named "<b>Schiller</b>" - looks like the name of the great German 
philosopher. Leonardo <b>da Vinci</b> is immortalized here in the name 
of Relm's brush. And of course Larry, Curley, and Moe, the <b>Three 
Stooges</b>, are in this game. (What am I doing? Mentioning the Stooges 
in the same breath as mythological heroes...?) 

<p>And some equipment:  (Most of these are thanks to Andrew Vestal.)

<p><b>Atma Weapon</b>: "Atman" is the Hindu word for the soul or eternal 
essence. Since the strength of the weapon is determined by your 
vitality, or essence, the name makes sense.

<p><b>Cherub Down</b>: A cherub is a winged celestial being in the 
second order of angels.  Cherub Down, which makes you float, would be 
feathers from a cherub's wings.  Cherubim are often seen together with 
seraphim, like the Esper.

<p><b>Coin Toss</b>: Lets you throw coins, obviously. But originally it 
was named "Heiji no Jitte" (Heiji's Cross) in FF6j. Heiji was a 
fictional character who threw coins at his enemies, like Setzer.

<p><b>Genji Equipment</b>:  In the 11th century, Murasaki Shikibu wrote 
the Tale of Genji.  (Remember Tat's story of the Seto Naikai battle in 
the <a href="#ff5yoichi"">Yoichi's Bow</a> entry, FF5 section?) The Genji 
clan was famous for its battles with the Heike, another samurai clan.  
In 1185, the Genji won a decisive battle with the Heike and almost 
eradicated them completely.  

<p><b>Graedus</b>:  Could be derived from the Latin "gladius" which 
means "sword". Incidentally, 'gladius' is the root word in 'gladiator'.

<p><b>Kotetsu</b>: A Japanese sword that is shorter than a Katana but is 
longer than a Wakizashi.  Its shorter length gives it more defensive 
abilities than the Katana.  It is sometimes called Naga-Wakizashi, which 
means "long Wakizashi".

<p><b>Minerva Armor</b>: The Roman name for Athena, the Greek goddess of 
war and wisdom.

<p><b>Mithril equipment</b>: A metal of legendary strength.  The name 
comes from J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy.  There's also the 
Roman soldiers' god "Mithras"; a name which was believed to be divine by 
the Gnostics.  In Greek numerology, the word has the value of 365... a 
value shared by 'Agion Onoma' (Holy Name); thus its significance.

<p><b>Tao Robe</b>: Taoism is an Eastern philosophy based on the 
teachings of Lao-Tzu in the 6th century B.C.  In FF6j, it's called 
"Doushi no Robe".

<p><b>Zephyr Cape</b> Zephyr was the gentle West Wind.  The word 
"zephyr" can also mean a gentle wind or breeze. 
<hr>
<p><a name="ct"><h3>Chrono Trigger</h3>

<p>Not part of the Final Fantasy series, but very much in the Squaresoft 
tradition.  Not as many mythological things as FF3, but of course there 
are many noteworthy items.  Some items, like the Valkyrie and Kali Blade 
have origins that are listed with other games.

<p><b>Chrono</b>:  Means "time".  Cronos was the leader of the Greek 
Titans.  "Chrono" is part of many time-related words like "chronology", 
"chronometer", "chronicle", etc.

<p><b>Lucca</b> could be named for the Italian city which flourished in 
the 15th century.  It's the root word in many light-related terms in 
European languages, like "lucent".

<p><b>Ayla</b>:  In the book series "Clan of the Cave Bear" by Jean M. 
Auel, there's a character named Ayla.  She's from the prehistoric past, 
but is semi-intelligent, just like CT's Ayla.

<p><b>Kino</b>: ('ki no) German for 'cinema', or stressed another way 
("kinou"), Japanese for 'yesterday' - undoubtedly coincidence!  Also, 
the main character in John Steinbeck's "The Pearl" is named Kino.

<p><b>Magus</b>: Comes from Latin and means someone who uses magic.  
Incidentally, Magus is immortalized in FF2 and 3 as well.  At the top of 
the Tower of Zot in FF2 you meet the "Magus 3", and FF3 has Strago Magus 
(who lives in Thamasa, the town of magic) and the Magus Rod.

<p><b>Janus</b>:  <b>Magus</b>' real name, from 12000 BC.  The first 
month is named for Janus, who was the Roman god of gates and doors. 
Janus was a two-faced god; one face saw the past and the other saw the 
future.  Appropriate for Magus, who saw both in his extensive time 
travels.

<p><b>Prometheus</b>: Robo's real name. Though Robo is a robot, created 
by humans, he's named for the Greek god who stole fire to create humans. 
There's an enemy in FF3 named "Prometheus" also.

<p><b>Atropos</b> is one of the three Fates in Greek mythology.  Atropos 
means "inflexible" and she severs the thread of life... which isn't 
really appropriate for the robot in CT, but...

<p>In Norstein Bekkler's lab, you meet <b>Wedge</b>, <b>Vicks</b>, and 
<b>Piette</b>.  Wedge and Vicks, who also show up in FF3, are rebel 
pilots in the movie "Star Wars".  And one of Darth Vader's assistants is 
named "Admiral Piette".  (Vicks should be <b>Biggs</b>, though.)

<p><b>Cyrus</b>: In the 6th century BC, Cyrus the Great unified the 
Persians and the Medes, and went on to conquer all of Babylon.  Maybe 
the CT character is named for him.

<p><b>Melchior</b>, <b>Belthasar</b>, and <b>Gaspar</b>: These are the 
names of the three wise men in the Bible.  Originally their names (in 
CT) were Bosh, Hash, and Gash; they're nonsense words and don't have any 
meaning.

<p>Here are some decidedly non-mythological names:<b>Ozzie</b> comes 
from Ozzy Osborne, <b>Slash</b> is from Guns 'N Roses, and <b>Flea</b> 
is from Red Hot Chili Peppers.  At least I think I've got them right 
this time... ^_^

<p>Remember in 12000 BC when the <b>Nu</b> writes, "The Mystery of Life, 
Vol. 841, Ch. 26.  All life begins with Nu and ends with Nu. This is the 
truth! This is my belief!  ...at least for now," in a book?  This is the 
actual origin of the word!  In Greek lore, Nu is the primeval fluid with 
which the world was created.  

<p><b>Terrasaur</b> (one of the dinosaurs):  This name is actually a 
pun.  "Terrasaur" looks like it would mean "earth lizard", but there are 
also dinosaurs named "Gigasaur" and "Megasaur". So it's actually "tera" 
meaning "1 trillion."  Many dinosaurs, both real and imagined, appear in 
Square games.  Some real ones are: Tyrannosaurus Rex (FF1, 5j, 3), 
Brontosaurus and Ceritops (should be Triceratops) (FF3), Black Tyrano, 
Mesosaur, and Pterodactyl (CT); some fictional dinosaurs are Wingraptor 
(FF5j), Gigasaur, and Megasaur from CT.

<p><b>Pahoehoe</b> (pa-ho-ay-ho-ay):  This is a kind of soupy lava which 
flows from volcanoes.  Thus it has a volcano-like form.

<p>The <b>Mammon Machine</b>: "Mammon" refers to the god of greed and 
avarice.  Appropriate for Queen Zeal. (not Schala; thanks for correcting 
me, everybody! ^_^)  Mammon appears as a tree in FF5 and as a person's 
name in SoM. (see those games' entries too)

<p><b>Giga Gaia</b>: This time, I think Giga has its original meaning of 
"gigantic" (rather than '1 billion').  Gaia means earth, so the whole 
name means "Great Earth".

<p><b>Barghest</b> is a frightful goblin that portends misfortune.  I'm 
not sure which mythology it's from, though.

<p>There's a skeleton'like enemy named <b>Macabre</b>; this comes from 
the French word for death.  You may know it from Camille Saint-Saens' 
famous 1875 musical piece, 'Danse Macabre', in which Death plays his 
violin in a graveyard at midnight; eventually dawn comes and he is 
chased away.

<p><b>Meso Mail</b>:  Probably refers to the Mesozoic Era, which ended 
about 65 million years before the present time.  Before that was the 
Paleozoic; this era is the Cenozoic.

<p>Town of <b>Medina</b>: In A. D. 622, Mohammed moved from Mecca to 
Medina; this is known as the Hegira.  The Islamic calendar begins with 
this pilgrimage; in that calendar, this year is 1418.

<p><b>Kajal</b>, spelled Kajar in the American CT, was a real city in 
the Middle East.  I'm not sure if it still exists.

<p><b>Some historical stuff...</b> I don't think that the date 65 
million BC was chosen arbitrarily.  A while ago it was shown by Luis 
Alvarez that a meteoric impact in the Yucatan peninsula around that time 
may have been what triggered the global climate changes which caused the 
dinosaurs to become extinct and indirectly paved the way for mankind to 
rule the earth much later. And in CT, Lavos arrives in a meteor at 
exactly that time!  Of course, it was artistic license on the producers' 
part to have human beings alive at that time. And having them speak 
semi-intelligible English...
<p>12000 B. C. is supposedly when Atlantis sank, which ties in perfectly 
with the sinking of the kingdom of Zeal.  There are several theories 
about where Atlantis once was; one of them puts the great civilization 
on the island of Thera.
<p>Also, the "Day of Lavos" comes in <b>1999</b>... and in the 15th 
century, Michel de Nostredame, also known as Nostradamus, predicts the 
end of the world to be in July of 1999.  He wrote a quatrain that began 
"In the year 1999 and 7 months... Mars shall reign at will." [Mars is 
the war god in Roman mythology.]

<hr><p><a name="bl"><h3>Bahamut Lagoon</h3>

<p><b>Bahamut Lagoon</b> is another of the untranslated Square games.  
Though still an RPG, Bahamut diverges sharply from the FF series.  It's 
a strategy RPG and you don't have the freedom of movement and 
non-linearity that you have in FF games.  The plot, though, is just as 
intense as in any game -- BL is possibly the most emotional of them all 
-- and Square does a fine job with character development, especially 
considering that there are thirty (!) of them.  And, of course, there 
are interesting names!

<p><b>Don Juan</b>, one of the main characters, appears in numerous 
Spanish stories and operas as a seducer of women.  He's true to form in 
this game. ^_^

<p><b>Anastasia</b> and <b>Ekaterina</b> come from the Russian royal 
family; they were deposed (and killed) during the 1917 revolution.

<p><b>Frunze</b> might be named for the city in Russia, and 
<b>Toulouse</b> is a city in France.

<p>There's a character whose name can be read either as the French word 
<b>Reve</b>, which means 'dream', or the German <b>L&oumlwe</b> (Lowe 
with o-umlaut), which means 'lion'.

<p><b>Melodia</b>'s name means 'melody' , of course, in Russian and 
perhaps several other languages.  There's a Russian music publishing 
company with this name, and <i>Clockwork Orange</i> fans may recognize 
it as the name of Alex's favorite music shop.

<p>One of the Petit Devils is named <b>Wagahai</b>, which is an 
archaic-sounding Japanese word for 'I'.

<p><b>Taicho</b> and <b>Gunsou</b> aren't really personal names, but 
military ranks.  Roughly equivanlent to calling someone 'Sergeant' or 
'Captain'.  Their home, <b>Mahal</b> means 'great' and may have been 
inspired by the famous Taj Mahal in India.

<p>Some of the enemies' names come from German (I'll assume that if you 
can read this document, you can understand the over 90% that are English 
^^;)... some make sense, some don't...
<br><b>Jubel-Bund</b> = 'joy group'.
<br><b>Jubel-Blitz</b> = 'joy lightning'.
<br><b>Lanze Ritter</b>, a boss, means 'Lance Knight'.
<br><b>Berge Kamerad</b> = 'mountain comrade'.
<br><b>Siegfried</b> is the name of a cannon. (A <i>cannon</i>!? ^^;)
<br>There's an boss named 'Iks-tset', which is the German pronunciation 
for the letters <b>XZ</b>.
<br><b>Karl Gustav</b>, former king of Sweden, shows up here too.
<br>And there are others...

<p>This game's magic includes <b>Armageddon</b>, meaning the apocalypse, 
and <b>Halley Gazer</b>, a comet-like burst of energy... this refers to 
the famous Halley's Comet, named for Edmund Halley.  He was the first 
person to determine the period of this, arguably the world's most famous 
comet.  It appears roughly every 75.9 years; the last appearance was in 
1985-86 and the next will be in 2061.

<p>Weapons: <b>Pax Kahna</b>, which is derived from Latin and means 
'Kahna Peace'.  It was probably inspired by the long peaceful period in 
Roman history; 'Pax Romana'.  Though it's anyone's guess why they'd name 
a weapon for this; after all, weapons are for war.
<br><b>K&uumlgelblitz</b> is German for 'ball lightning'.
<br><b>Cassandra</b> is the name of a woman from classical Greek times 
who was supposedly given the ability to se the future.  She decided to 
use her gift to warn people of the disasters that were to befall them, 
but no one believed her and thus the tragedies were never averted.
<br>The <b>Dreadnought</b>, a sword in this game, comes from the name of 
a British battleship developed around the turn of the century.  England 
figured that its new technology would give it an advantage over rivals 
France and Germany, but unfortunately for them, Germany was able to not 
only make its own Dreadnought but make them in greater numbers, thus 
negating England's new-found power.

<br>Armor: <b>Maximilian</b> was once archduke of Austria.  Another man 
of the same name was emperor of Mexico, 1832-1867.
<br><b>Sleipnir</b> is Odin's steed.
<br>The <b>Mach Vest</b> could be named for Ernst Mach, a scientist who 
worked with sound waves.  The 'Mach ratings' used for comparing speeds 
of airplanes to that of sound, as in Mach 1 = 330 m/s in air, are named 
for him.
<br><b>Imperator</b> comes from the Latin for 'leader'.

<p>Many of the dragons' names are repeated from other games... they're 
<b> Valitra, Leviathan, Garuda, Jormungand (an alternate name for FF6's 
Midgardsorm), Hyperion, Bahamut, </b>and<b> Alexander.</b>.  The dragons 
live in <b>Altair</b>, which is the name of a star.  That word comes 
from Arabic, as do many astronomical terms; the Arabs kept learning and 
science alive during Europe's Dark Ages.

<p>The airship (well, it's more like a flying fortress) is called 
<b>Fahrenheit</b>, like the scientist who invented the temperature scale 
that bears his name.  One of the enemy ships is called <b>Trafalgar</b>, 
which was the site of a famous British naval battle.

<hr>
<p><a name="sd3"><h3>Seiken Densetsu 3</h3>

<p>Most of the stuff in this game has already appeared elsewhere.  But 
there are some new things...

<p>There was a weapon named <b>Siegmund</b>; Siegmund was the father of 
<b>Siegfried</b>.  Also <b>Fenrir</b>, the <b>Valkyries</b>, and many 
other things from that saga appear in one form or another in SD3. And 
items from past games such as <b>Mjolnir</b> (Thor's hammer), 
<b>Orichalcon</b>, and a few others.

<p>One of Riesz's high level magics is called <b>Marduk</b>.  Marduk is 
the creator of the world in Mesopotamian myths.

<p>Also, in this game, there are seven weekdays and each one is related 
to one of the elemental sprites.  Most of them hinge on a knowledge of 
Japanese, so I've summarized everything here:

<hr><a name="ff7"><p><h3>Final Fantasy 7</h3>

<p><b>Main Characters:</b>
<p><b>Cait Sith</b> (pronounced, roughly, 'kett shih') is Irish.  It 
means 'fairy cat' in Gaelic.  Supposedly, it's a kind of spirit that 
brings good luck.  Of course, they don't normally ride around on 
moogles. ^^;

<p><b>Sephiroth</b> has a great origin!  It's Hebrew for 'numbers' and 
is directly related to Arabic 'sifra', French 'chiffre', German 
'Ziffer', and English 'cipher'.  (Sanskrit 'shunya' meaning 'void', 
originally.)  In Hebrew (among other alphabets), each letter has a 
numerical value, and the art of adding the letters in a word or phrase 
to get a certain value is called 'gematria'.  In Hebrew, the word 
Sephiroth has the value of 756; in Greek, 894.  Can anyone find any 
significance in these numbers?  I was hoping to relate them to the safe 
combination in the Shinra Mansion, but they don't seem to work. ^^;  
Here are the ten important Sephiroth:
<ul><li><b>1</b> - Kether, the Crown
<li><b>2</b> - Chokmah, Wisdom
<li><b>3</b> - Binah, Understanding
<li><b>4</b> - Geduldah, Greatness
<li><b>5</b> - Geburah, Strength
<li><b>6</b> - Tiphemeth, Beauty
<li><b>7</b> - Netzach, Firmness and Victory
<li><b>8</b> - Hod, Splendor
<li><b>9</b> - Yesod, Foundation
<li><b>10</b> - Malkuth, the Kingdom</li></ul>
(There are variations on these; this list is from <i>777 and the 
Cabalistic Writings of Aleister Crowley.</i>)
<hr>The final enemy, Safer Sephiroth, should probably be <b>Sepher 
Sephiroth</b>, which means 'the book of numbers' in Hebrew.  (I'm not 
sure if the Bible book has that exact name in Hebrew, though.)  It isn't 
exactly obvious where whoever named him was going with this, but maybe 
it has something to do with all the little numbered black clones that 
are skulking around in Nibelheim.  One of his attacks is <b>Pale 
Horse</b>, which probably refers to 'Death on a Pale Horse', a 1905 (?) 
painting by Ryder.

<p>Some of the lyrics in Sephiroth's final theme, 'One Winged Angel', 
come from Carl Orff's <i>Carmina Burana</i>.  "Estuans interius, ira 
vehementi" (track 12 on most CDs), "Veni, veni, venias; ne me mori 
facias" (track 21), and "Gloriosa... generosa..." (24) all show up 
verbatim during the Sephiroth battle!  The rhythm is entirely different 
-- both pieces have a playful sound in Orff's composition as opposed to 
the intensity of FFVII's final battle -- but those lines, and perhaps 
several others, are the same.  There are many other vocal arrangements 
of FF themes that appear on separate CDs (sold in Japan only) which I 
won't go into here, because there's already a fine web page devoted to 
them.  Go to Nora Stevens' <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~nstevens/fflyrics.html">Opera 
House</a> for more info.

<p><b>Wedge</b> and <b>Biggs</b> of Star Wars return in this game as 
well.

<p>Shinra goon <b>Heidegger</b> shares a name with an early 20th-century  
German philosopher, Martin Heidegger.  Coincidence, probably.  Also, 
<b>Reno</b> is a city in Nevada and Miss <b>Scarlet</b> is a character 
in Clue, the board game and film starring Tim Curry, Christopher Lloyd, 
and others.

<p>The Ancients' original name, <b>Cetra</b>, could come from the Latin 
'cetera', meaning 'others'... the Cetra were the 'other' race of people 
who originally populated the Earth.

<p>The main city is named <b>Midgar</b>, just like Midgard in Norse 
mythology.  It means 'earth'.  Cloud's hometown is <b>Nibelheim</b>, 
which is the frozen hell.  Another town is <b>Costa del Sol</b>, which 
means 'sun coast'.

<p>Another place is the <b>Zango Valley</b>, in the north.  In the 
original Japanese version, this was called 'sango' which simply means 
'coral'.  

<p>Call Monsters include:

<p><b>Knights of the Round</b>.  This refers to King Arthur's twelve 
Knights of the Round Table.  Two of them were Uwain and Lancelot.  

<p><b>Kujata</b> is from the Bahamut legend.  He's the bull with 
numerous body parts that sits beneath the mountain, supporting the 
world.

<p><b>Hades</b>, as you probably know, is another word for hell, or the 
underworld.

<p><i>Enemies: </i>There really aren't too many... at least not from 
mythology... but there are these few:
<p>The Russian authors <b>Gorky</b> and <b>Chekhov</b> make appearances 
in the pagoda in Wutai.  They don't speak Russian, but their Japanese is 
kind of weird. ^^;
<p>You'll find <b>Diablo</b> in the frog forest late in the game; its 
name means 'devil'.
<p>And in a bizarre and purely coincidental mistranslation, "Allemagne"
(which really should be "Ahriman") is the French word for Germany.

<p>The crashed Shinra plane, Gelnika, is probably a misspelling of 
<b>Guernica</b>, the title of a painting by Picasso (I think).  It's a 
depiction of the Spanish Civil War.  (I'm trying to remember that 
painting from my art history class a year and a half ago... ^_^;  Does 
anyone know more about this?)

<p>Most of the weapons have already appeared... but new ones include:
<br><b>Winchester</b>, a type of gun.  Vincent uses it.
<br><b>Longinus</b> is one of Cid's spears; changed to the utterly 
colorless 'Spirit Lance' in the American version.  It was the weapon 
that pierced Christ's side after they took him down from the cross, and 
also the name of the Roman centurion who used it. Supposedly, the holder 
of this weapon would be granted immortality, and it has also been said 
that Hitler was looking for this during World War II.  It's also the 
name of a Greek philosopher, but that's probably a coincidence.  (It's 
in Bahamut Lagoon as well.)

<p>There are many Japanese characters that remain in the English 
version, some of which are...
<br><li>Cloud's <b>Cross-Slash</b> forms the shape of the kanji 'kyou', 
which means 'bad luck'.  
<li>'Ikari' ('anger') on the chests of the Skeeskees in Cosmo Canyon, 
<li>'Shanghai Tei' in Rocket Town,
<li>'Kamedouraku' on the Turtle's Paradise building in Wutai.  
'Kamedouraku' does indeed mean Turtle's Paradise, but ubless you can 
read that, you might not know that that's indeeed the place that posts 
flyers all over the world!  
<li>Also in Wutai:  Kanji 'Hi' and 'buki'  ('fire' and 'weapons')  above 
the weapon shop
<li>Katakana 'materia' on the Wutai materia shop sign,
<li>In Godo's house: 'Tsurugi' ('sword') on the floor in the shining 
room, 'kokoro' ('heart') on the wall in the room where you sleep,  
<li>'Shinobu' ('endurance', 'stealth'; also the 'nin' in 'ninja') on the 
purple rug in Yuffie's house,
<li>'Ikkaku senkin' (idiomatic for 'strike it rich') in the room under 
the bell near the pagoda,
<li>This is Greek, sort of... when getting on the Ropeway, there's a 
sign that spells out the English words 'Amusement Park' in Greek 
letters.

<br>(In case you're thinking, 'How are Americans supposed to figure all 
that stuff out!?" ... keep in mind that the ludicrous number of 
<i>English</i> signs were all there in the original version.  I guess 
Japanese players had to have English dictionaries close at hand!

<p>In Dio's Show Room at the Gold Saucer, there are some useless and 
apparently meaningless artifacts on display.  Two of them, though, could 
be significant.  One is the <b>D-Type Equipment</b>, which also shows up 
in the anime Evangelion, and another is <b>Klein's Pot</b>.  It's called 
Klein no Tsubo in Japanese, which does literally mean Klein's Pot, but 
could be referring to the Klein Bottle, which is a three-dimensional 
analogue of the Mobius Strip (see <a href="#ffmq">FFMQ's entry</a> for 
how to make one).   It's just the kind of fanciful object that would 
show up in a showroom like Dio's, don't you think?

<p>Lastly, the Party Hensei System (PHS) item shares initials with the 
Personal Handiphone System, an kind of cellular phone in Japan.  Thus 
the cell-phone beep when you call your teammates.  Japanese FFVII 
players will get the joke right away, but it's too obscure over in the 
U. S. ^_^;
<hr>
<b><h3>FF Tactics</h3></b>
<br>
<p><b>Alma</b>'s name comes from Hebrew and means 'young woman'.

<p><b>Beowulf</b>, one of your companions, has the same name as the hero 
from the ancient Anglo-Saxon legend.  In the story, Beowulf kills 
Grendel, a monster who's been preying on the people.

<p><b>Wiglaf</b>, called Wiegraf in the English version, is one of 
Beowulf's 'thanes', or warriors, in the Beowulf saga.

<p>The execution site where Ramza and Gaffgarionduel is called 
<b>Golgoralda</b>... this may have come from Golgotha, the 'killing 
field' where Christ was crucified. 

<p><b>Some items:</b> The perfumes that can be worn by female characters 
have French names.  <b>Sortilege</b> means 'magic', <b>Cherche</b> means 
'search for', and <b>Chantage</b> means 'blackmail.'  

<p> Two of the knives are named <b>Iga</b> and <b>Kouga</b>.  These are 
the names of two ninja clans from Japan.  Another knife, <b>Platina 
Messer</b>, just means platinum knife in German.

<p> The <b>Gokuu Rod</b> is named for Son Gokuu, the hero of an ancient 
Chinese tale.  I don't know the plot of this story, but Son Gokuu is 
also the name of one of the main characters in the popular manga and 
anime series 'Dragon Ball' by Akira Toriyama.

<p>The <b>Perseus Bow</b> is named for the archer in Greek mythology.

<p>There's a sword named <b>Save the Queen</b> (Meriadole has it); this 
is a line from the British song 'God Save the Queen.'  I don't think 
there's an actual sword with this name, though.  Another possiblilty 
(see below) is that it's another reference to what is surely the 
producers' favorite band.

<p>Armor: The <b>Caesar Plate</b> probably refers to the family that 
ruled Rome around the time of the birth of Christ.

<p>This game has a nod to Lucasfilm just like FF3, CT, and FF7... this 
time <b>Luke Skywalker</b> and <b>Indiana Jones</b> (well, Luke and 
Indy) demonstrate battle techniques in the Tutorial!  Other movie 
references include two directors who show up as either enemies or 
mercenary-shop allies, Robert <b>Zemeckis</b> of Back to the Future 
fame, and Terry <b>Gilliam</b>, from 'The Adventures of Baron 
Munchausen' and 'Brazil' (Hey, <i>I</i> liked those. ^_^).  

<p>Another subtle nod is hidden in Chapter 4's title, <b>In the Name of Love</b>, which came from a song by the band Queen.  (The Japanese 
chapter title, 'Ai ni subete o', means something like 'all for love'.)  
Other Queen references are the title of the game <b>Ogre Battle</b>, its 
subtitle March of the Black Queen, and <b>Tactics Ogre</b> subtitle 'Let 
Us Cling Together'.  All are Queen songs.

<p>Aside from Golgoranda, the place names are fictional.  But for some 
reason, Midlight's Deep levels have English words  for names even in 
the import version.  Two of them look like they're actually other words 
spelled backward -- <b>Nogias</b> and <b>Mlapan</b>.  In fact, in the 
Japanese FFT Daizen strategy guide, Mlapan is alphabetized as if it were 
'napalm' instead.  Still, I've no idea what these names have to do with 
the game (Vietnam War references? <b>Valkyries</b> could even refer to 
that war if you consider that Wagner's music was played in the movie 
<i>Aocalypse Now</i>...).  Incidentally, the <b>Deep Dungeon</b> itself 
comes from a previous Square game of the same name.  It was one of their 
first releases back in the 1980s, before Final Fantasy even existed.
<hr>
<b><h3>Miscellaneous</h3></b>

<p>Another thing Square likes to do is use <b>variant spellings</b> in 
their games.  For example, you've probably noticed the Lunar Subterrane 
in FF2, Fenix Down, Gaea Gear, and Ziegfried in FF3, the Valkerye sword 
in CT, among others.  "Crono" is an alternate spelling too, but it's 
probably used because the names in CT can only have up to 5 letters. 
"Ziegfried" might be because in English it's a better phonetic 
approximation to the real pronunciation.

<p><b>And one last thing</b>: German composer Richard Wagner's name has 
popped up here and there (Siegfried, Odin, Tristam, etc.) and it's worth 
mentioning that Square's wonderful habit of using music to advance the 
plot of the story or giving each main character his or her own theme 
dates back to Wagner's operas. He invented the "Leitmotiv" (pronounced 
like English "light motif") which is sort of like what Square does with 
their game music. For example, the Valkyries had a theme which was 
played when they were the central characters just like, say, Shadow's 
theme is heard when there's a plot twist involving him. Anyhow Square 
uses the Leitmotiv rather effectively. 

<p><b>Further reading...</b> There are lots of books which contain 
either info directly related to FF stuff, or tangential things that you 
might be interested in.  This list here isn't in any particular order, 
and is by no means complete! ^^;
<li><u>The Book of Imaginary Beings</u>, by Jorge Luis Borges.  As the 
title implies, it's got lots of info about the mythological beasts that 
Square designers love so much.
<li><u>Clan of the Cave Bear</u> (and its sequels) by Jean M. Auel.  Set 
in the Ice Age, they feature Ayla of Chrono Trigger.
<li><u>The Once and Future King</u> by T. H. White, has some Arthurian 
legends which pop up in FF games from time to time.
<li><u>Der Ring des Nibelungen</u>, or The Ring of the Nibelung, is the 
long saga which contains Siegfried, Odin, Ragnarok, and numerous other 
people and places without which the Square series just wouldn't be the 
same!
<li><u>The Inferno</u> by Dante.  A journey through Hell; our heroes 
meet up with FF2's Fiends, among other baddies.
<li><u>Bulfinch's Mythology</u> is a great reference book on world 
mythology.
<li><u>From One To Zero</u>, by Georges Ifrah, has a lot of information 
on gematria (see the Sephiroth entry) and numbers in general.  Also, 
it's the source for the Osiris-Set story in the FF Legend section.

<p>Notes to contributors: I tried to stay as close as possible to your 
exact words as I could in this file. I only paraphrased a little bit so 
that everything sort of reads in the same voice (mine). So I may have 
edited things just a bit, but not enough to change anything 
substantially, I hope.
