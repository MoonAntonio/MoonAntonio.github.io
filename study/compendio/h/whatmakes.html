<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What Makes a Final Fantasy?</span></span><br></div><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Twenty years. Over twenty games, not including expansion packs, ports,
and remakes. Thirteen systems (including the PC, the MSX, and mobile phones). Two anime series, two full-length movies, even a
Potion drink. Final Fantasy started off as a last-ditch attempt by a
plucky startup company and now is nothing less than a gaming and
marketing juggernaut. But what does <span style="font-style: italic;">Final Fantasy </span>mean?
Does Square-Enix simply tack on the name to any game they want to sell
well? Is it a particular gameplay mechanism? Style? Story? Staff
members? Let's deconstruct what makes a Final Fantasy.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Name</span><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The name "Final Fantasy" is now one of the most ironic in any industry.
Although the original Final Fantasy was&nbsp;thought to be the
last one Squaresoft might make, there now seem to be three or four
coming out in any given year (albeit many of those being rehashes or
spinoffs of previous games). What's interesting, though, is that back
when RPGs were the sole domain of pimply-faced white male teenagers
(i.e. before the marketing whirlwind that was FFVII), the success of
the first Final Fantasy drove Squaresoft to localize a bunch of games
with the Final Fantasy name on it in the hopes of driving up sales. The
main examples of this were the Final Fantasy Legend series for Game
Boy; many people don't realize that these games were released as SaGa
in Japan, and are actually part of the same series as SaGa Frontier and
Unlimited SaGa. In addition, it released Final Fantasy Adventure for
the same platform; in Japan it was known as Seiken Densetsu, a series
which is sold on this side of the pond as the Mana series.
(Interestingly, though, the first Seiken Densetsu did indeed have the
subtitle "Final Fantasy Gaiden" or "side story", which shared several of the familiar features we outline below.)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Having cleared that up, let's try to
concentrate on the numbered Final Fantasies as the bellwethers of
defining the series (although games like FF Tactics and Dirge of
Cerberus are still Final Fantasies, as we will see). Can we tease out
the commonalities that make them
what they are?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Gameplay Mechanics</span><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The one most obvious aspect to Final Fantasy games is the one that,
oddly enough, seems to be the least consistent amongst the games.
Certainly, the first nine or ten games seem to have the same basic
gameplay systems. Explore areas, talk to people, buy items, equipment,
and spells, use menus to configure your characters, and fight battles.
This formula has remained largely unchanged for the most part, but
there are certainly many other games, even by the same developer, which
follow the same system and yet are not Final Fantasies, such as Chrono
Trigger and Xenogears.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the battle system
itself, Final Fantasy is well-known for having two separate systems
even in the first, largely static epoch. Numbers I through III had a
simple turn-based system, while numbers IV through IX introduced the
famous Active Time Battle (ATB) system. Since then, each entry in the
series has drastically altered even how battles themselves take place,
with FFX introducing a non-real-time system where characters can
instantly swap out, FFX-2 changing over to a much faster-paced ATB
system with dynamic jobs, and FFXII eschewing random battles altogether
for a constantly battling dungeon area and complex AI "gambits".<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Clearly, trying to look at gameplay by itself won't get us anywhere.
Let's turn our attention to the content of the individual games.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Setting<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It's called "Final Fantasy", right? It must take place in a fantasy setting, right? We'd be wrong there, but on the right track.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Each game, other than the sequels, take place in an entirely different
world, completely unconnected from its predecessors. There are
virtually no characters who appear in multiple games (at least not as
the same character). What's more, even the general settings are wildly
different. Early games such as FFI and FFIII are pretty much pure
Dungeons &amp; Dragons fantasy settings; since then, we've since seen the
dark, steampunk vibe of FFVI, the futuristic dystopia of FFVII, the
more modern-feeling FFVIII, the tropical FFX, and the political
intrigue-laced medieval FFXII.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing that <span style="font-style: italic;">can</span>
be said, however, is that every single game in the series mixes
technology and fantasy. Even the very first offering had a robot and
airships, unusual anachronisms in its generic fantasy world. Many of
the games have airships for public use, or involve space travel. The
more futuristic FFVII and FFVIII still have ample evidence of magic and
spiritual power, and the main characters invariably use swords rather
than guns, the only exception being the RPG/shooter hybrid <span style="font-style: italic;">Dirge of Cerberus: FFVII</span>. Clearly, the dichotomy between fantasy and science is one of the hallmarks of a Final Fantasy game.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Species</span><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
While the general details of the games differ wildly, it's in the
specifics where we'll begin to find a larger hint to the family
dynamics of Final Fantasy. Most common are its mascots, the original
creatures and animals created by Squaresoft and used extensively
throughout the series. Most well-known, of course, is the bird used as
transportation, the chocobo. Widely assumed to have been inspired by
similar birds in the anime <span style="font-style: italic;">Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind</span>,
chocobos have played a role in nearly every Final Fantasy (with the
exception of FFI, where they hadn't been invented yet). Chocobos have
gone on to star in their own, kid-centered Final Fantasy games, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon</span> series and its spinoffs, including<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>several games unreleased in North America (we did get <span style="font-style: italic;">Chocobo and the Magic Picture Book</span>).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The other star of the series is the lovable Moogle. Known as Mogri in
Japan (a mix of "mole" and "bat"), the word Moogle was coined by Ted
Woolsey, the translator of FFVI. While they haven't appeared in person
in every game (with conspicuous absences in FFI, II, and IV), the vast
majority of them have moogles of some sort somewhere. For example,
FFVIII has a "Mini-Mog" summon only obtainable via the <span style="font-style: italic;">Chocobo World</span>
add-on game, and FFX has a Moogle doll used as a weapon. Their
appearance has changed over the years as well, especially in the newer
Ivalice games such as FF Tactics Advance, but they remain an instantly
recognizable aspect of the series.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It doesn't
stop there, though. Many creatures who started off as generic monsters
began getting their own following in later games. These include the
strong-but-silent Cactuars (known as Sabotenders in Japan), the cute
but scary knife-wielding Tonberries, bombastic Bombs, powerful purple
Behemoths, squishy Flans, punchy Goblins, and foul-breathed Malboros.
Often, these colorful creatures appear in mini-games or have their own
conclaves and civilizations (such as the Cactuar Village in FFX or the
Tonberries in FFXI).<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Character Crossovers<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
it was stated above that few characters cross over between games,
there's one that everybody knows: Cid. He appears in a different guise in virtually every
Final Fantasy (he's absent from FFI) as a technological
genius. He's often related to your airship in some way, is almost
always older than the fresh-faced protagonists, and usually crusty and outspoken. His roles have ranged
from plain old NPCs&nbsp;to playable characters (FFIV,
FFVII, and FF Tactics) and even villains (FFXII). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Later games have often featued cameos by two buddies, Biggs and Wedge.
Named after Luke Skywalker's wingmen in <span style="font-style: italic;">Star Wars Episode IV</span>,
they're sometimes bad guys, sometimes good guys, and sometimes just
sitting on the edge watching things. They're nearly always hapless comedy relief, though, and seeing them usually brings a smile
out!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, one of the most popular
characters in FF has been the multi-armed Gilgamesh. After stealing the
spotlight from his far duller boss Exdeath in FFV, he's appeared as a
summon in FFVIII, a hustler in FFIX, and a mark to be hunted in FFXII
(with his first voiced appearance). His signature theme, <span style="font-style: italic;">Battle on the Big Bridge</span>,
has been covered by Nobuo Uematsu's hard rock band the Black Mages and
remixed for FFXII. He's probably the only sidekick in an FF game to
have his <span style="font-style: italic;">own</span> sidekick, Enkidu.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fans often comment that final bosses in FF games tend to be
long-haired pretty boys... however, this is largely undeserved, and
based off only three games in the series (VII, IX, and X). In any case,
this is an anime staple and certainly not limited to Final Fantasy
games in the least.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Summons</span><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A staple of the series since FFIII, summons have remained mostly the
same while constantly being reinvented visually. One of the interesting
aspects to them is that while they have always been called <span style="font-style: italic;">shoukanjuu</span>
(Summoned Beasts) in Japanese, their translated name changes almost
with every new game. FFVI called them Espers, VII reverted to Summons,
VIII used Guardian Forces, IX had the unusual term Eidolons, X invented Aeons, and XII went
back to Espers. They often play an integral part in the story;
individual summons provide important plot points in FFIV, VI, IX, and X,
whereas GFs in general impact the story of VIII.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The summons themselves are as familiar as chocobos. The most famous
would be the fiery Ifrit, ice-cold Shiva, enemy-slicing Odin, sinewy
Leviathan, and draconic Bahamut, who all appear in some form in almost
every iteration. Others that make common but not constant appearances include lightning god
Ramuh, holy castle Alexander, protective Carbuncle, revivifying
Phoenix, and earth giant Titan; whereas each game generally has some of
its own unique offerings.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Items, Equipment, and Spells<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Getting
even more in-depth than monsters and summons, individual items appear
consistently throughout the series. These include the ubiquitous Potion
and its various permutations, Ethers, Elixirs and Megalixirs, Phoenix
Downs, Antidotes, Eye Drops, Echo Grass, Gold Needle/Soft, Tents, and
myriad other pieces of healing mojo, as well as a Chocobo's favorite
food, Gysahl Greens (named after a town in FFIII). A look at armor will
almost always yield an Aegis Shield, Mythril equipment, Genji Glove,
and the status-protecting Ribbon. Weapons usually include the Excalibur
and Ragnarok swords, the Masamune katana, and the powerful Ultima
Weapon.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spells are instantly recognizable as
well. The tried-and-true Fire/Fira/Firaga, Blizzard/Blizzara/Blizzaga,
Thunder/Thundara/Thundaga, and Cure/Cura/Curaga have stuck around in
various guises in every game. You'll also see Raise to revive your
characters, Esuna to cure their status ailments, Haste, Slow, and Stop
to manipulate time, Libra to scan enemies' weaknesses, Gravity to chop
off a fraction of enemies' HP, Poison and Bio to debilitate them, Quake
to shake them up, Shell and Protect to keep them safe, and Flare and
Ultima to blow them away.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Music</span><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"The world is veiled in darkness. The wind stops, the sea is wild, and
the earth begins to rot. The people wait, their only hope, a
prophecy... 'When the world is in darkness Four Warriors will come...'
After a long journey, four young warriors arrive, each holding an ORB."
This apocalyptic script was the first thing greeting Final Fantasy
pioneers after popping the first game into their NES. However, the
impact of these words would have been negligible if it weren't for the
soaring arpeggios of the Prelude theme washing over us. This theme
became as familiar as Chocobos as it began or ended, in some way,
almost every game in the series (with the notable exception of FFVIII).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Chocobo theme itself has been reimagined in practically every game
since its inception in FFII; mambos, electronica, pop tunes,&nbsp;brass
band, or Hawaiian ukeleles. Likewise, whenever Moogles appear, their
own signature tune usually plays as well. And who can forget the
grandiose tune known only as "Final Fantasy"; often illustrating the
ending, it was first heard when your party crossed the Northern Bridge
in the original game.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Summary</span><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Final Fantasy is quite difficult to pin down as an idea. Games
featuring the name have varied from traditional Japanese RPGs to
tactical RPGs, first-person shooters, and MMORPGs. Stories, characters
and worlds come and go. But they all have familiar features which greet
us like old friends when we encounter them. A world which mixes fantasy
and technology; Chocobos and Moogles; Ifrit and Shiva; Firaga and
Ultima; Excalibur and Ragnarok; a man named Cid; Prelude and Final
Fantasy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's hoping for another twenty years of memories.<br>
