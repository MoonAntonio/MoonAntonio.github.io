        <dt><b>Auron</b>[HERO]</dt>

        <dd>[FF10] Originally a high-spirited, naive guardian
        assigned to Lord Braska. Auron accompanied Braska and Jecht
        all the way to Zanarkand, where he learned the truth about
        the Final Summoning. He attacked Yunalesca and was killed,
        but was never Sent. His last promise to Jecht was to
        protect Tidus, Jecht's son, so he traveled to the
        dreamworld Zanarkand. Jecht as Sin visited Zanarkand and
        brought Tidus into Spira. Auron fulfilled his vow to Jecht
        by protecting Tidus and Yuna throughout Yuna's pilgrimage.
        Auron became somewhat of a legend after Braska's
        pilgramige, and other guardians (such as Dona's Barthello)
        revere him. At the end of FFX, Auron allows himself to be
        sent and rests on the Farplane. Auron's original good
        spirits and high ideals were dashed down after death, and
        he became a rather morose straight-shooter. He doesn't
        speak often, but he has a piercing sight into matters and
        usually sees deeper than most people do. He doesn't beat
        around the bush; when he has something to say, he'll say
        it... and he's usually right. He gets all the cool lines,
        too. 8p He's intensely shamed about his actions with Braska
        and avoids the issue among company. In battle he's the
        strongest character in the game, with armor-piercing
        weapons, but rather slow. He carries a flask of sake (rice
        wine) and keeps his sword arm in his shirt; these are both
        signs of a ronin - a samurai without a master - which he
        adopted once Braska was killed. (See also <a href="kingdomhearts2.html">Ex-Crossover:Kingdom Hearts 2</a>,

        <dd>[FFX-2] Lian's more taciturn friend, who runs away with
        him on a journey through Spira to search for a cure for
        Kimahri's horn. He doesn't find it, but does find
        insight.<br>

        a member of the Crimson Squad. Although he's noble, he
        tends to guard Yevon's secrets a bit too closely, causing
        much acrominy between him and his former compatriot, Nooj.
        Shuyin eventually possesses him and takes him to the
        Farplane.<br>

        Hypello barkeeper of the Gullwings' Celsius airship is a
        funny little fella, just like everyone else of his race. He
        has a sweetie-pie who comes on board in chapter 5

        <dt><b>Barthello</b></dt>

        <dd>
            [FF10] Dona's bullish guardian who also doubles as
            her... I dunno, what's the word for "lover" if you take
            out the "love"? 8p He idolizes Auron (and degenerates
            into a slobbering mess when he meets him) and almost
            never speaks. Good thing, too, since he's never been
            known to say anything intelligent. 

            <p>[X-2] Barthello later joins New Yevon - which
            conflicts with Dona's joining the Youth League. Much
            to-do is made of their tiff and (hopefully) subsequent
            reuniting.</p><br>

        Besaid to train up the lackadaisical Aurochs for Youth
        League duty. It's an uphill battle for him. He's an old war
        buddy of Chappu, who constantly praised Wakka, so when he
        actually meets Wakka he's sorely disappointed. He does have
        some respect for him, though, and appreciates his desire to
        protect those he's close to, although he insults his actual
        ability to do so.<br>

        find out her home is in Remiem Temple, and she's yet
        another Unsent. Yuna agrees to Send her after she's
        defeated all of her Aeons.<br>

        can't call him a sore loser - he accepts defeat with grace
        and dignity. He is later killed by Seymour along with many

        Although an honorable, magnanimous, high-class individual,
        Braska was a bit of a maverick; he had a sense of humor.
        Yuna's mother was an Al Bhed, a fact that would have proved
        deeply embarrassing had the church of Yevon found out about
        it. Braska was protected on his pilgrimage by Auron and

            ball and speaks like Yosemite Sam. He cares deeply for
            his niece Yuna and his daughter Rikku, and is fiercely
            protective of them. He's a whiz with machina, like all
            Al Bhed. Strong, cynical, and quite the hard-liner. He
            was the brains behind the "kidnap the summoners so they
            won't kill themselves" movement, a cause which he feels
            quite close to, since Yuna's on the same quest.. 

            <p>[X-2] For some odd reason, Cid finds it useful to
            parade the Zanarkand Ruins as a tourist attraction; he
            hires Isaaru to be the main event. Naturally, Yuna gets
            annoyed by this and (if you like) tells him off. He
            spends most of the game sulking in the Thunder Plains,
            at which point he has to get rescued by his daughter
            and niece from a nasty monster. After this, he comes
            onboard the Celsius and makes a pain out of himself

        First they demand that he slaughter Yuna, which he tries to

        installed there to try to put some order into it. Perhaps

        <dd>[FF10] Tidus's father is, quite frankly, a boor. He's
        the star blitzball player in Zanarkand, but unfortunately
        he's well aware of it. Jecht's encounter with Sin shoved
        him from Zanarkand to Spira where he unexpectedly ended up
        guarding Braska on his pilgrimage after being thrown in
        jail due to a Drunk And Disorderly charge. During the
        journey, though, we realize certain things about him - that
        he wasn't as mean a lout as he used to be, that he can
        actually control himself when he needed to, and that he
        really did care about his son, though he had no idea how to
        show it. Tidus always has a burning hatred for his father
        (whom he really blames for his mother's death of "broken
        heart") which is never fully assuaged. Jecht surrendered
        himself to become Braska's Final Aeon and therefore Sin...
        when Tidus has to fight him in that form, the swirling
        emotions of love, hate, and sorrow are almost too much for
        him. Jecht has a <a href="../misc/jechtlogo.jpeg">large
        tattoo</a> on his chest, which also appears when he is in
        his aeon form; it also appears at the start of the game

            promise he made to Braska) just before Auron died.
            Kimahri complied, but Yuna begged him to stay with her
            and not to leave. He did, and eventually became her
            guardian. Kimahri barely speaks (in fact, it takes
            about ten hours before he says a single word), and when
            he does talk it's in the typical Ronso
            third-person-Neanderthal-speak. He's stolid and usually
            has something surprising to say when he does talk. In
            battle Kimahri's kind of a blank slate: you can make
            him do anything you want, but he'll invariably be worse
            at it than anyone else in your party. (See also

            his hands full keeping them at bay. Eventually Yuna
            (hopefully) manages to knock some sense into Garik,
            though, and Kimahri gets his own statue when people
            finally realize his leadership potential.</p><br>

        <dt><b>Lulu</b> [HERO]</dt>

        <dd>
            [FF10] Lulu has apparently made a business of being a
            guardian for summoners; Yuna's her third pilgrimage,
            the first being Lady Ginnem, who died, and the second
            being Father Zuke, who quit. She grew up in Besaid
            Island (though she seems extremely out of place with
            the islanders). She was romantically involved with
            Wakka's brother, Chappu, and after his death became
            fairly glum; she now rarely smiles. She takes a long
            time to get used to Tidus because of his resemblance to
            Chappu. Lulu has a jaded view of the world; she doesn't
            try to stop people from doing what they want to do, and
            they leave her the hell alone. She's very knowledgable
            and is usually the person who explains everything to
            Tidus. She shares Wakka's optimism in the Yevon church,
            but her world-weary approach means she's not quite as
            broken when she sees the truth. In battle, Lulu's the
            main Black Mage and attacks with cute widdle dolls.
            (See also <a href="jobs/blackmage.html#FF10">Jobs:Black Mage</a>) 

            <p>[FFX-2] Lulu marries Wakka, and she's pregnant for
            the majority of the game (although not visibly so,
            mainly due to programmer laziness). Eventually she
            gives birth to a son, Vidina.</p><br>

        the facade - his motto is keep your head down, always say

        of duty is impeccable, and he falls in battle with Sin
        during Operation Mi'ihen. (You can stop this from happening
        by convincing Gatta to fight in the front lines; then Gatta
        will die and Luzzu will survive and return to Besaid.) He
        was the one who convinced Chappu to join the Crusaders;

            death involving the Final Summoning, but only because
            he truly believes that there's no way to actually
            defeat Sin. He's fanatically opposed to anyone trying
            to pierce the dead beliefs of the church, however, and
            it takes a huge overthrow (i.e. Yuna) to make him Send

        <dt><b>Rikku</b> [HERO]</dt>

        <dd>
            [FF10] Rikku is the daughter of Cid, leader of the Al
            Bhed, which makes her first cousins with Yuna (or, as
            she insists on calling her, "Yunie"). She helps her dad
            out with his salvage operations and on one of them,
            searching for the legendary airship, she meets Tidus.
            She agrees with her father's insistance that the
            summoners' pilgrimages are bad, but when she tries to
            capture Yuna, she's thwarted by the five other
            guardians. After a short talk, though, she allows
            herself to accompany Yuna and accept her decision about
            her own life. Rikku is the token
            high-pitched-hyper-teenager type. She's very idealistic
            and a bit ditzy, but she can keep a cool head, except
            in the presence of lightning, which she has an
            irrational phobia about due to a childhood trauma. In
            battle she can't do much damage, but she's versatile
            otherwise, being able to dismantle robotic enemies,
            steal items, and use special items in battle. (See also

            <p>[FFX-2] Wearing even less than before (and sounding
            even dumber), Rikku now exists almost exclusively for
            comic relief. She's the one who got Yuna started on the
            whole sphere hunting thing, though. One thing of note
            is that she cured her fear of lightning by camping out
            in the Thunder Plains for a whole week. (See also

            truth: he uses it as part of a fund to rebuild the Al

        <dd>[FF10] In my opinion, the most annoyingly superfluous
        person in any RPG. He became the maester of the Guado by
        killing his father, Lord Jyscal, and amazingly, no one
        seems to care. (At least at first... his servant Tromell
        eventually regrets his glossing over of the fact.) Born the
        son of a Guado and a human, the resulting childhood
        problems had his mother turn herself into a fayth and
        therefore an Aeon (named Anima) in order to give him more
        power. (Maybe try to spend more time with him instead of
        killing yourself, eh?) Seymour likes the power, though, and
        eventually his demented mind decides that everybody in
        Spira is suffering too much, so let's just kill 'em all! He
        decides to become Sin. Oof. Yuna and co. actually kill him
        in their first fight, but Seymour doesn't let himself be
        Sent. He actually tries to marry Yuna several times
        (gross!) and somehow manages to get generic RPG-Villain Big
        Bad Bodies during subsequent battles until he's finally
        Sent inside Sin.<br>

        <dd>[FFX-2] The villain of the piece. Shuyin was a citizen
        of Zanarkand, who fell in love with Lenne during the war a
        thousand years ago. He tried to use Bevelle's secret
        machina Vegnagun to save Lenne from his own side, but both
        he and her were shot dead before he could reach it.
        However, his anger and hate were so strong that they lived
        on (in the Den of Woe, a cave below the Mushroom Rock
        Road), and he drove anyone who entered mad. However, the
        Crimson Squad survived his attack; he responded by
        "possessing" Nooj. In the ensuing years he manipulated his
        way up until he found his way into Baralai, and through
        him, into the Farplane where Vegnagun lay in wait. However,
        Yuna, channeling Lenne through her dressphere, confronted
        him and finally got him and Lenne to rest. It's just
        conjecture, but I believe Tidus was a "dream" of someone
        who was once a real person in Zanarkand. Perhaps the
        "dream" was a bit nicer than the reality, which is that
        Shuyin, who Tidus was based on, was not a very nice man at
        all.<br>

        is thrust from the dreamworld Zanarkand into Spira when Sin
        visits it. About 98% of the game is seen from Tidus's point
        of view; in fact, he narrates his own thoughts frequently
        as well. Tidus is an optimistic, good-natured young man
        with high ideals, but he's quite human and a bit of a
        crybaby, as it appears. Although his main goal is to return
        to Zanarkand, he soon finds that he cares deeply for his
        new friends, especially Yuna. The news that Yuna won't
        survive her pilgrimage hits him particularly hard. During
        most of the game Tidus feels like an outsider, not knowing
        anything about his surroundings, but eventually he gains
        leadership qualities and becomes a real get-goer. As for
        what happens to him once the fayth stop their dream... it's
        left completely up to conjecture. (See also <a href="kingdomhearts.html">Ex-Crossover:Kingdom Hearts</a>,

        perfect ending, the fayths somehow manage to bring him back
        from the "sort of dead" to meet Yuna in the waters near
        Besaid. And they live happily ever after.<br>

            his similarity to Chappu and approves of Yuna's
            decision to enlist him as another guardian. Formerly
            the captain of the Besaid Aurochs, his blitzball got a
            bit rusty after Chappu died and he found himself unable
            to concentrate; he's still quite a good player, though.
            A fierce believer in Yevon's teachings, he's
            incredulous as he slowly perceives the church's
            hypocrisy. Wakka is laid-back and cool; a neat Hawaiian
            accent accompanies his statements. He's also devout,
            though, which sometimes sounds a bit weird. He has a
            good sense of humor and sometimes likes to horse
            around. In battle, Wakka's blitzball throws are great

            <p>[FFX-2] Rikku claims he's pudgier, but he looks
            exactly the same. Oh well. Having married Lulu, Wakka
            is now going nuts worried about what he needs to do to
            be a father. At one point he searches for a sphere of
            his parents, whom he never met, to find out what
            parenting is all about; but he fails. Beclem, a war
            buddy of Chappu, is disappointed in Wakka's wimpiness
            and knocks heads with him a few times. In the end,
            Beclem gives Wakka a sphere of Chappu, who asks why he
            couldn't just be a brother instead of a surrogate
            father. Wakka realizes that he can't always make up
            molds for him to fit into, and decides to go along with
            his gut feeling (excuse the pun).</p><br>

        to actually inhabit the Aeons he summoned, and he
        transformed a particularly powerful one into Sin, a living
        armor doubling as a demon of terrible destruction.
        Bevelle's armies were blown away by Sin, though Sin's
        creation also caused the destruction of Zanarkand. The
        people of Zanarkand were turned into fayths, who kept
        Zanarkand alive through their dream. Yevon's daughter
        Yunalesca began the "spiral of death" with the first Final
        Summoning. Spira was so scared of Yevon that they
        constructed an entire church dedicated to his "teachings",
        which include laws against machina. Yevon remains in Sin
        throughout the spiral of death, continually summoning the
        dream of the fayth: Zanarkand.<br>

        <dt><b>Yuna</b> [HERO]</dt>

        <dd>
            [FF10] The daughter of High Summoner Braska and an Al
            Bhed (the sister of Cid) (which accounts for her having
            one green eye and one blue), Yuna was brought up in
            Besaid Island. She's childhood friends with Lulu,
            Wakka, and Chappu (at least until Chappu was killed).
            She's always had the good of Spira in mind, and
            resolved to become a Summoner as soon as she could, not
            caring about the consequences. She's priveleged with no
            less than six guardians before her pilgrimage is up.
            After Sin is defeated, she becomes something of an ad
            hoc leader in Spira. As Auron puts it, Yuna's "serious
            to a fault"; though she does laugh and cavort at times,
            you always get the feeling she's just doing it as a
            diversion from her pilgrimage, which is never far from
            her mind. She's quite strong-willed, though, and once
            she decides to do something, no matter what the
            consequences, it gets done. She's rather private as
            well, and doesn't always tell her friends everything on
            her mind. In battle, she's the sole summoner and acts
            as a White Mage as well. (See also <a href="jobs/whitemage.html#FF10">Jobs:White Mage</a>,
            <a href="jobs/summoner.html#FF10">Jobs:Summoner</a>) 

            <p>[FFX-2] Yuna's undergone a massive personality
            change, probably due to the newfound lack of purpose in
            her life. She's now a carefree sphere hunter, a member
            (and de facto leader, notwithstanding Brother's
            protests) of the Gullwings. Her wardrobe funds seem to
            have been depleted, though. She now packs two guns and
            kicks ass. She runs around Spira searching for Tidus,
            who she thinks she saw in an ancient sphere.
            Eventually, after finding out about Vegnagun, and
            hearing about the fiend attacks around Spira, she
            abandons her sphere hunting for a line of work closer
            to her heart - helping out people who need it. Still
            kicking ass along the way, though. (See also
