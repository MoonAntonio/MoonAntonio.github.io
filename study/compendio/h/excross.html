<h3><a name="square" title="square"></a>References in Other Square Games to Final Fantasy</h3>
<p>
Square just can&#39;t resist putting some Final Fantasy-isms in some of their other games. Here&#39;s a list of them (thanks to <a href="http://www.gamespot.com" target="_top">videogames.com</a> and <a href="mailto:mjohnson@carolnet.com">Jared Johnson</a> for some of the suggestions and information.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Dynami Tracer</strong> <em>(SNES - unknown release date)</em>: This extremely obscure Squaresoft game for the Satelliview (an SNES add-on only released in Japan) was some kind of cross between RPG and racing. In any case, good old Tonberry is one of the racers!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="../misc/dynamiav.gif" alt=""><img src="../misc/dynamifront.gif" alt=""><img src="../misc/dynamiside.gif" alt=""><img src="../misc/dynamiback.gif" alt=""><img src="../misc/dynamihappy.gif" alt="">
<p>
<strong>Final Fantasy Legends</strong> <em>(GB - released 12/15/89 JP, 1989 NA)</em>: Since the &quot;Final Fantasy Legend&quot; games are actually SaGa games with the names changed to cash in, any FF references in them would count as ex-series crossovers. (sent by Angry Turnip, Japanese FFL names sent by Gouki of Borg):
</p>
<ul>
	<li>One boss, the Machine, looks the same as FF1&#39;s <a href="espmon/bosses3.html#warmech">Warmech</a>. In the Japanese versions they both have the same name: Death Machine.
	</li>
	<li>Amongst the top tier monsters which can only be obtained as party members are FF1&#39;s four fiends. The strongest zombie is <a href="espmon/lich.html">Lich</a>, strongest octopus is Kraken, strongest dragon is <a href="espmon/tiamat.html">Tiamat</a>, and strongest snakewoman is Lilith (both Lilith and Kary share the Japanese name Marilith).
	</li>
	<li>He also notes that FFL uses a number of FF1&#39;s sprites.  It is likely that the town sprites are the same, and FF1&#39;s thieves look the same as FFL&#39;s male mutants.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Final Fantasy Adventure (Seiken Densetsu)</strong> <em>(GB - released 6/8/91 JP, 1991 NA)</em>: This Game Boy title has very little in common with other Final Fantasy games, which is why it is not in our canon game list.  One of the commonalities it does have are the Chocobos and Moogles which feature heavily in the storyline. This is actually the first time <a href="species/moogle.html">Moogles</a> were named in a Squaresoft game!  
</p>
<li>Also, the graphics are very reminiscent of FF3 and FF4 (even the menu screens!).
<p>
<strong>Secret of Mana (Seiken Densetsu 2)</strong> <em>(SNES - released 8/6/93 JP, 1993 NA, 11/24/94 EU)</em>: <a href="species/moogle.html">Moogles</a> make another appearance here (as a status ailment, and as a species in the northern part of a forest). 
</p>
<p align="center">

<img src="../misc/somoogle.jpeg" alt=""><img src="../misc/somoogle2.jpeg" alt="">
</li>
<li>Besides this, the secret Moai face mentioned in <a href="incross.html">In-Series Crossovers</a> makes an appearance here as well!
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p align="center">
<img image="/misc/som.jpg" alt=""> <img image="/misc/som2.jpg" alt="">
<p>
<strong>Live A Live</strong> <em>(SNES - released 9/2/94 JP, 1994 NA)</em>: This funny little RPG had a tiny FF reference: While playing as Akira in the &quot;Near Future&quot; chapter, you can play the organ in the orphanage he lives in. One of the songs you play is a truncated <a href="../midis/4chocchoc.mid">Chocobo theme</a>. (sent by <a href="mailto:tpowell@UCSD.Edu">Trevor Powell</a>)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Secret of Evermore</strong> <em>(SNES - released 1995 NA, 2/22/96 EU)</em>: The American copy of Secret of Evermore had some very blatant character crossovers. Firstly, Cecil from FF4 now runs a weapons/armor shop and inn in Ebon Keep. The music track for this area is called &quot;Cecil&#39;s Town&quot;.  
</p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p align="center">
<img image="/misc/evermore3.jpg" alt=""> 
</li>
<li>Secondly, in the Coliseum fight, several characters from FF6 (from left, Locke, Mog, Relm, Strago, Terra, and Umaro) make an appearance in the stands! Here are the exclusive photos of the events:
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p align="center">
<img image="/misc/evermore2.jpg" alt=""> <img image="/misc/evermore4.jpg" alt=""> 
<p>
<strong>Chrono Trigger</strong> <em>(SNES - released 3/11/95 JP, 9/27/95 NA)</em>: Biggs and Wedge (known here as Vicks and Wedge) make an appearance with their buddy Piette in Norstein Bekkler&#39;s lab. (See <a href="#starwars">Star Wars Crossovers</a>)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p align="center">
<img image="/misc/chrono.jpg" alt="">
<p>
<strong>Seiken Densetsu 3</strong> <em>(SNES - released 9/30/95 JP)</em>: Also known as Secret Of Mana 2. The &quot;Magician&quot; enemy from this game is identical to the &quot;Black Mage&quot; Job, right down to the crescent on his hat! 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="../misc/sd3wizard.jpeg" alt="">
</li>
<li>There&#39;s also a piece of armor called the &quot;Moogle Smock&quot;.</li>
<p>
<strong>Bahamut Lagoon</strong> <em>(SNES - released 2/8/96 JP)</em>: An only-in-Japan game. Obviously besides <a href="../misc/blbahamut.jpeg">Bahamut</a> himself, as a summon, there&#39;s also the <a href="../misc/blpresenter.gif">Presenter</a>, a sorta-secret monster who also happens to appear in FF6 as an optional mini-boss. One of the final forms of Thunderhawk, &quot;D.Chimera&quot;, looks very similar a monster of the same name from FF5.
</p>
<li>Also, certain of the forms of Salamand, the hero&#39;s dragon, appear similar to monsters from FF6.  Deboahan looks like the Allosaurus, White Warrior looks like the Buffalax. (pictures sent by <a href="mailto:ketshi@gmail.com">Ket Shi</a>) <br>
<p align="center">
<img image="/misc/vommamothbl.gif" alt="Vommamoth"> <img image="/misc/buffalaxbl.gif" alt="Buffalax"> <img image="/misc/allosaurusbl.gif" alt="Allosaurus"> <img image="/misc/chimerabl.gif" alt="Chimera"> <img image="/misc/hidonbl.gif" alt="Hidon">
<p>
<strong>Super Mario RPG</strong> <em>(SNES - released 03/08/96 JP, 03/09/96 NA)</em>: A hidden boss in Monstro Town - <a href="../misc/smrpg.jpeg">Culex</a>. Although this boss doesn&#39;t appear in any Final Fantasy, his cohorts, the four Crystals, should be familiar to everyone! His boss music is identical to that of FF4, and the victory music is the ever-loved <a href="../midis/fanfare.mid">Victory Fanfare</a>. 
</p>
</li>
<li>Also, there&#39;s a dragon-like monster called &quot;Bahamutt&quot; in the game. (sent by <a href="mailto:joeymartin64@yahoo.com">Joey Martin</a>) 
<p>
<strong>Tobal 2</strong> <em>(PSX - released 3/31/97 JP, 4/25/97 NA)</em> : Chocobo is one of the hidden characters .
</p>
<p align="center">
<img image="/misc/tobal2choc.jpg" alt="">
<p>
<strong>Xenogears</strong> <em>(PSX - released 2/11/98 JP, 1998 NA)</em> : Hanging on the wall in a house in the upper-class Solaris community is a poster of Tifa!
</p>
<p align="center">
<img image="/misc/xenotifa.gif" alt="">
</li>
<li>Also note that two characters here are named Roni and Rene, which are the same as the middle names of Edgar and Sabin from FF6. See <a href="nameChara.html#ronirene">Name Origins</a> for more info on that.
<p>
<strong>Parasite Eve</strong> <em>(PSX - released 3/29/98 JP, 1998 NA)</em> : The hanging banner in front of the Museum Of Natural History has a <a href="../misc/parasiteevechocobo.jpeg">Chocobo</a> on it.
</p>
<p align="center">
<img image="/misc/parasiteevechocobo.jpg" alt="">
</li>
<li>Also, inside the museum, in the prehistoric bird section, there is a display of a suspicious looking yellow bird.
<p>
<strong>Ehrgeiz</strong> <em>(PSX - released 1/17/02 JP, 4/30/99 NA, 2/9/00 EU)</em>: See <a href="ehrgeiz.html">sub-page</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Legend of Mana</strong> <em>(PSX - released 7/15/99 JP, 6/7/00 NA)</em>: If you go to the city of Geo and you go to the Magic Academy, look at the sign in front of the building; a small black mage can be seen clearly on the sign. (sent by <a href="mailto:jupiter_jazzer@yahoo.com">Jeff M.</a>)
</p>
</li>
<li>A bard named Gilbert (the JP name of FF4 Edward) is a minor character.
<p>
<strong>Parasite Eve II</strong> <em>(PSX - released 12/16/99 JP, 2000 NA, 8/25/00 EU)</em>: writes that one part of the game has Aya trying to find a cure for a computer virus known as &quot;Cloud&quot; - the antivirus is called &quot;Aeris&quot;. (sent by <a href="mailto:aqua_twister@yahoo.co.uk">Denisse</a>) 
</p>
</li>
<li>One of the central enemies in the game, No. 9, wields a gunblade.  One of Aya&#39;s secret weapons (a 12 gauge rifle) is also called a gunblade. 
<br>
<p align="center">
<img image="/misc/parasiteevegunblade.jpg" alt="">
<p>
<strong>Vagrant Story</strong> <em>(PSX - released 2/10/00 JP, 5/15/00 NA, 6/21/00 EU)</em>: This game was made by the same team who did FF Tactics, so of course they&#39;d stick some references to FFT in it. For starters, a lengthy quote in the stunning introduction sequence is attributed to &quot;A.J. Durai&quot; - better known as Alazlam from FFT. 
</p>
</li>
<li>Four of the items in the game are &quot;Agrias&#39;s Balm&quot;, &quot;Beowulf&quot;, &quot;Orlandu&quot;, and &quot;Altema&quot;. 
<p>
<strong>The Bouncer</strong> <em>(PS2 - released 12/23/00 JP, 3/5/01 NA, 6/22/01 EU)</em>: A character, Volt Krueger, has a Cactuar in a logo on his jacket. (sent by <a href="mailto:tommydang123@netzero.net">Cactuberry</a>)
</p>
<p align="center">
<img image="/misc/bouncervolt.jpg" alt="">
<p>
<strong>Kingdom Hearts</strong> <em>(PS2 - released 3/28/02 JP, 9/16/02 NA, 11/15/02 EU)</em>: See <a href="kingdomhearts.html">sub-page</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Star Ocean 3: Till the End of Time</strong> <em>(PS2 - released 2/27/03 JP, 8/31/04 NA, 10/01/04 EU)</em>: At the beginning of the game there is a terminal that gives the weather, predicting a possible squall.  The game then updates your in-game dictionary with the word &quot;squall&quot; which reads as such: 
</p>

<strong>Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories</strong> <em>(GBA - released 11/11/04 JP, 12/07/04 NA, 05/06/05 EU)</em>: This is something of a sidestory to Kingdom Hearts, although it incorporates a lot of elements that are seen in Kingdom Hearts II.  The storyline of the game is based on Sora&#39;s memories of Kingdom Hearts 1, so nearly all the same crossovers that showed up in the first game (including characters, magic, keyblades, etc.) show up here as well.  You can summon Cloud in battle where he can do Cross-Slash or Omnislash.  The enemy cards also have FF abilities: Maleficent - Overdrive, Hades - Berserk, Wight Knight - Float, Oogie Booge - Regen, Vexen - AutoLife.  <br>

<br><li>Item # 472 (a hint one can buy) has this description: Playing Reaper Creeper requires Matoya's spell, but "NEERC SEVAS EHT TARDNALD LOH" is a mouthful, so most folks don't bother. (if one does hold the L and R buttons at the save screen one is shown how much time one has used.) [This is a reference to the famous "TCELES B HSUP" message that the brooms in Matoya's cave said in FF1.]
<br><li>At a certain point in the game, a villain named Sho Minamimoto uses a super attack named "Level i Flare" a reference to the "level # Flare" spells. The letter i represents an imaginary number, one that can be found by drawing the square root of a negative number.

<h3><a name="chocobo" title="chocobo"></a><a name="chocobo" title="chocobo"></a><strong>Chocobo Games</strong></h3>
<p>
<a name="chocobo" title="chocobo"></a>These three games (Chocobo&#39;s Mysterious Dungeon 1 and 2, and Chocobo Racing) are almost part of the FF series, but not quite. Basically, everything is dumbed down and cutesied-up. Here&#39;s a list of what appears where (unfortunately, Chocobo&#39;s Mysterious Dungeon 1 was never translated into English, so my information is rather sketchy.) There are several more monsters which are direct from FF games, as well.
</p>
<p>
<a name="chocobo" title="chocobo"></a><strong>Chocobo no Fushigi Dungeion (Chocobo&#39;s Mysterious Dungeon)</strong> <em>(PSX - released 12/23/97 JP)</em>: Like any other RPG, the player takes on the role of an ever-changing Chocobo.  With his moogle companion Atra, they travel to a Chocobo gardener&#39;s house.  This gardener has uncovered a violet crystal in his garden and has become possessed by it.  When he invites you in, he kicks you down into his cellar, and thusly, the dungeon, where your adventure begins.

Chocobo is once again paired up with Mog, where they travel to a small beautiful village.  However, this village has many inpenetrable buildings, indecipherable ruins, and, of course, mysterious dungeons within.

<strong>Chocobo Racing</strong> <em>(PSX - released 3/18/99 JP, 7/31/99 NA)</em>: One day, Chocobo visits Cid at his laboratory, who provides him a new invention called the Jet-Blades CR, which increases Chocobo&#39;s speed greatly.  This results in a great many races, culminating in a showdown with Bahamut.
</p>
</li>
<li>There&#39;s a racing track called the FF8 Track. <a href="mailto:Simonammundsen@aol.com">Simon Ammundsen</a> provides this blurb, as well as all the music info for this game: 
<blockquote>
	&quot;On the FFVIII Circuit, you can see various monsters (the Malboro is the most prominent) and also a load of Glabadian Soldiers at one point. It also resembles the Bird&#39;s Eye View of Deling City a bit. What I mean by this is that whenever you seen Deling City from the President&#39;s microphone in FF8, there&#39;s a definite shape to the city. The FF8 circuit is almost the same shape. You can also see the front gate of the presidential residence, and there are screens showing the original <a href="jobs/fighter.html">Fighter/Warrior</a> and <a href="species/chocobo.html">Chocobo</a> sprites from the NES series. Gysahl greens are advertised all around the track.&quot;

<p>
<em>Others:</em> (NOTE: These are the names of the tunes in the Sound Room option.)
</p>
</li>
<li>&quot;Spooky-Wooky!&quot; Fear tune - This is how the <a href="../midis/3lastbatt.mid">FF3 Final Boss theme</a> opens up. 
(It plays twice then fires up the bit used for the Fantasia track).
</li>
<li>&quot;La-La Legend&quot;  - Plays at any time relating to the Magicite Crystal legend. The Crystal Prelude with a little kid going &quot;La la la&quot; over it.
</li>

<strong>Chocobo World</strong> <em>(PSX - released 12/31/99 JP)</em>: This little game was included in FF8, but could only be accessed by a peripheral called the PocketStation, a kind of memory-card device only available in Japan. However, it is playable on the PC version of FF8.  The basic gameplay is to take a baby chocobo and raise its strength, similar to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi" target="_top">Tamagotchi</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokemon" target="_top">Pokemon</a>.  The purpose of this game-within-a-game is to gain rare items, weapons, and even GF&#39;s that are harder to find elsewhere.  There are Moombas that give you Money, and Cactuars that give you items. When get into a battle, The battle theme is <a href="../midis/7faster.mid">&#39;Hurry Faster&#39;</a> from FF7. And when you die, and you rest up your HP, it is <a href="../midis/7goodnight.mid">&#39;Good Night, Until Tomorrow&#39;</a> from FF7. And lastly, you can find a fire, a beach, or picnic table (that&#39;s what it kinda looks like) and the music is just the beginning of <a href="../midis/7chocwaltz.mid">&#39;Waltz de Chocobo&#39;</a> from FF7.

The creator&#39;s name, Ryukishi07, is also a reference to Reina.  The &quot;07&quot; is pronounced &quot;reinana&quot; and Ryukishi means &quot;Dragon Knight&quot; (this is more of a reference to owning the dragon, than the job of <a href="jobs/fftactics.html#dragoner">dragon knight</a> or <a href="jobs/dragoon.html">dragoon</a>.

<li><a name="fftoother" title="fftoother"></a>The first game to ever have had the honor of being ridiculed by a Final Fantasy game is the one and only Dragon Quest. In the first FF, a gravestone reads &quot;Here lies Erdrick&quot;. The main competition for Final Fantasy was Dragon Quest (Dragon Warrior in North America); in fact, it came out before FF and some say it was even the inspiration for FF. The warrior (not the one you play, one that died a long time ago) featured in this game was Erdrick (Loto in Japan). In the original Japanese, this gravestone read <a href="../misc/link1.jpeg">&quot;May Link rest in peace&quot;</a> - referring to the Legend of Zelda series. The line references Link in most versions of the game; the only ones which have Erdrick are the American NES version, the European PSX version, and the PSP version.

<h4>Star Wars References</h4>
<p>
The entire series has had snippets of references to <em>Star Wars</em>, including the names of Biggs and Wedge which are used in nearly every Final Fantasy game and then some.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biggs_Darklighter#Darklighter.2C_Biggs" target="_top">Biggs Darklighter</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedge_Antilles" target="_top">Wedge Antilles</a> are the names of Luke Skywalker&#39;s wingmen in his run on the Death Star in <em>Episode IV: A New Hope</em>.  They show up in the following roles in the following Final Fantasies:
</p>
</li>
<li><strong><em>FF6</em></strong>: Vicks and Wedge are two imperial soldiers in MagiTek armor who accompany Terra in the beginning of the game. (NOTE: Vicks is a mistranslation of Biggs which translates as Bi-G-Gu-Su.  The B and V are interchangeable in Japanese)
</li>
<li><strong><em>FF7</em></strong>: Two minor members of AVALANCHE, under Barret&#39;s tutelage.  Killed in the plate drop.
</li>
<li><strong><em>FF8</em></strong>: A captain and subordinate of the Galbadian Army, who continually get demoted with all their screw-ups.
</li>
<li><strong><em>FF10/X-2</em></strong>: Two separate NPC&#39;s who double as recruitable Blitzball players.
</li>
<li><strong><em>FF12</em></strong>: The guards at Nalbina Town are named Deweg and Gibbs.
<p>
<strong>FF4:</strong> 
</p>
</li>
<li>The name of Baron&#39;s airship force is called the Red Wings, Luke&#39;s squadron from <em>Episode IV: A New Hope</em>.</li>
<li>The second airship that the party commandeers is named the Falcon, possibly after the Millennium Falcon.
<p>
<strong>FF6:</strong> 
</p>
</li>
<li>The scene where Locke rescues Celes from South Figaro.

<strong>FF7</strong>: 
</p>
</li>
<li>Nanaki (Red XIII&#39;s real name) is an anagram of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anakin_Skywalker" target="_top">Anakin (Skywalker)</a>. (sent by <a href="mailto:Snesman64@aol.com">Snesman</a>) 
</li>
<li>Red XIII itself is probably a dig at Luke Skywalker&#39;s Red squadron from the first Star Wars (Luke was Red Five). 
<p>
<strong>FF7: Before Crisis</strong>: 
</p>
</li>
<li>Tierce, Kyneugh, and Kanos, three of the Ravens, are named after minor characters in Star Wars.
<p>
<strong>FF8</strong>: 
</p>
</li>
<li>Piet is the name of one of the executors on the space station taking care of Adel&#39;s Tomb.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiral_Piett" target="_top">Admiral Piett</a> was one of the imperial officers of the Empire in Episode V and VI.  
</li>
<li>Nida is a minor character of FF8 who eventually becomes the pilot of mobile garden.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_villains_in_Star_Wars#Needa.2C_Lorth" target="_top">Lorth Needa</a> was a minor officer in <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>, then became Captain. 
</li>
<li>Martine, the headmaster of Galbadia Garden was called Dodonna in Japan.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Dodonna#Dodonna.2C_Jan" target="_top">General Dodonna</a> is the character who briefs the rebel alliance on the attack on the Death Star in <em>Episode IV: A New Hope</em>.  
</li>
<li>In the Star Wars expanded universe, there is a planet known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onderon" target="_top">Onderon</a> (featured in the game <em>Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords</em>). Onderon is unique because its largest moon, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dxun" target="_top">Dxun</a>, orbits so close to the planet at times that their atmospheres mix together and create a tunnel of air between the two. Dxun is filled with many vicious beasts, which take advantage of the tunnel of air to migrate down to the planet and terrorize the natives. It all bears too much resemblance to the &quot;Lunar Cry&quot; in FF8, where monsters all flood down to the planet, to be a coincidence. In addition, the tomb of the great dark Jedi Freedon Nadd is located on Dxun. This is similar to the fact that the Sorceress Adel&#39;s tomb orbits the planet in FF8. (sent by Shigmiya64)

<li>Part of <a href="espmon/bosses2.html#necron">Necron&#39;s</a> speech at the very end of the game is: &quot;Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate.
