<dt><a href="ff6characters.html">??????</a> (6) </dt>
<dd>[HERO] This name is given to two people in 6: Terra, before she remembers her real name, and a ghost who joins up temporarily in the Phantom Train. The ghost can Possess people, but you'll have to find another one to join when it does, because it disappears!
<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff9characters.html">288, No.</a> (9)</dt>
<dd>The ad hoc leader of the Black Mages, he seems wiser than most of them and carries a crescent staff. He has an immediate affinity to Vivi, who seems to him to be something more than any of the other Black Mages are.<p></dd>
<dt>Ace Cardians (11)</dt>
<dd>These cardians were created to manage other cardians with basic wrong/right logic.  There are only four of them.  Under Karaha-Baruha's guidance, they built the super strong cardian - Joker.  When he died during the Crystal War, they lost their sense of right/wrong morality, and everything began to seem gray.  Unknown to the Tarutaru, the Ace Cardians kidnapped Zonpa-Zippa, and became lost during Crystal War.  They then reappeared afterward to Ajido-Marujido and stole his work.   Ajido-Marujido discovered they kidnapped Zonpa-Zippa to prevent him from revealing their plan reactivating Joker.  What they didn't realize was that Karaha-Baruha had bound his life force to Joker, so in order to resurrect Joker, they would have to resurrect Karaha-Baruha.  <p>
<dt><a href="ff8characters.html#adel">Adel, Sorceress</a> (8) </dt>
<dd>[VILLAIN] A very not nice lady who kind of had this little reign of terror going in Esthar. She was sealed away by Laguna and a few other people and sent into outer space, but Ultimecia's people got her out.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="fftcharacters.html#adramelk">Adrammelech </a>(Tactics), Adramelk (PSX) </dt>
<dd>The The Wroth is the Zodiac Brave assosciated with Dycedarg.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="fftacharacters.html#adrammelech">Adrammelech</a> (TA)</dt>
<dd>The Bangaa Totema. You may recognize him from the original FF Tactics.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff7characters.html#aeris">Aeris Gainsborough</a>, Aerith Gainsborough (7j) </dt>
<dd>[HERO] The mysterious and happy-go-lucky daughter of a Cetra and a human seems almost too good to be true for Cloud... and it soon turns out that she is. Aeris's tragic history is cut all too short by Sephiroth, who makes sure she doesn't get in the way of his plan... Her magical powers are admired by all, and even she doesn't understand most of the things she feels. She shows up for a cameo role in Tactics as the Flower Girl. <a href="fftcharacters.html#aeris">Click here for pictures from Tactics.</a><p></dd>
<dt><a href="fftcharacters.html#agrias">Agrias Oaks</a> (Tactics)</dt>
<dd>[HERO] A lady Hokuten Knight (under the auspices of the Lesalia St. Konoe Knights) who is devoted to Princess Ovelia. She is her personal guard and lives to serve her. When she's kidnapped by Larg and then Delita, Agrias joins up with Ramza to try her best to free her.<p></dd>
<dt><i><a href="ffucharacters.html#ai">Ai Hayakawa</a> (FFU)</i></dt>
<dd>Yu's "big sister" (actually his twin). Ai is a bit of a whiner for a twelve-year-old, and tends to provide the comic relief in the party. She's innately suspicious of most things, and thinks everything in the Inner World is weird. She's right, of course (most of it ends up embarrassing her at one point or another). Chocobos have a fixation on pulling her pigtails. At one point, she meets up with Fabra, who gives her Pokepoche as a pet. An encounter with Kuria leaves her a good deal more thoughtful than earlier. However, both Ai and Yu are a bit more complicated than it seems...<p></dd>
<dt>Aishya (6) </dt>
<dd>Name of a girl in Maranda.<p></dd>
<dt>Ajido-Marujido (11)</dt>
<dd>The son of Zonpa-Zippa, brother of Apururu, head of the Ministry of Orastery.  He attempted to find the reason why the lands around Windurst were drying up and dying after the Crystal War.  He dug into the Horotoro Ruins and found the cardians lost long ago after activating mysterious power generators.  The cardians stole his work and fled.  Later, he bought a book of magic from Nana Mihgo and met with the Yagudo out of the Star Sybil's jurisdicition to uncover the mysteries of the book.  He was captured after this and sentenced to prison in the Horotoro Ruins.  His sister saved him, but just as he was escaping he saw a strange figure and a flash of light.  He fell unconcsicous.  Later, he revealed to everyone the existence of the 6th ministry - the Ministry of Animastery, set up by Karuha-Baruha to twist fate and save the Tarutaru.  Also, Ajido-Marujido told of the cardians' master - Joker.  After he discovered that the mysterious figure that appeared to him was the life force of Fenrir and Karuha-Baruha, tied together, he came up with plan to save the kidnapped Star Sybil, lure Fenrir back to existence, and re-energize the Full Moon Well using the caridan's power.  Using the three Kuluu songs to lure the mysterious figure, he then overloaded the cardians and merged Joker and the mysterious figure, hoping the life force of Fenrir would prevail.  The plan succeeded, and words returned to the book of magic.  <p>
<dt>Ajora, St. (Tactics) </dt>
<dd>See St. Ajora.<p></dd>
<dt><i><a href="fftswcharacters.html#aki">Aki Ross, Dr.</a> (TSW)
</i></dt><dd>The protagonist of the movie is a strong-willed scientist entirely devoted to saving the human race from the Phantoms overrunning the planet. Her research led her to be infected with a Phantom particle, but she managed to contain it by using the wave patterns of the Spirits. Her search for the other Spirits are not just to save the world, but also her life - the Phantom keeps getting stronger and the Spirits are required to keep it where it is. Aki is dearly close to her mentor, Professor Sid, and finds herself strangely drawn to Captain Gray of the Deep Eyes.
<dt><a href="ff8characters.html#aki">Aki, Instructor</a> (8) </dt>
<dd>A very strict instructor in Balamb Garden who apparently gives hard tests. You can see him in a one-time-only scene in Disc 3 in Balamb Garden, floor 2, when he berates Squall if he uses magic in the hall.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="fftcharacters.html#alazlam">Arazlam Durai, Alazlam J.D. (PSX)</a> (Tactics)
<dd>The historian and narrator of the game. His search for an explanation of the long-hidden Durai Writings led to confrontation by the Murond Gladabos Church. The "D" stands for Durai...<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff11characters.html#aldo">Aldo</a></dt>
<dd>The hume leader of the Tenshodo, helping to sneak illegal weapons from the Far East to Bastok and Jeuno.  He was an escapee from Tavnazia during Crystal War as a child.  (He's the guy we see in the opening movie.)  He is one of the three heroes, along with Lion and Zeid.  In Rise of the Zilart, he plays a major role when his sister, Verena, is kidnapped to open the doors of the floating city, Tu'lia.  In Chains of Promathia, he secures a tavern.<p>
<dt><a href="fftcharacters.html#argath">Argath Thadalfus</a> (Tactics) </dt>
<dd>A snotty cadet who's rescued by Ramza and Delita, on his way to Eagrose to inform Dycedarg of the kidnapping of Marquis Elmdore. His family used to be aristocratic, but a story which leaked out regarding Argath's grandfather during the Fifty Year War (he betrayed his friends to save himself, but was stabbed in the back by a Hokuten Cadet before he went free) caused the Sadalfas family to lose their class. Perhaps because of his tenuous cling to his status, he hates all commoners intensely, to the point where he believes them to be only animals. He has a vendetta against the anti-aristocratic Corpse Brigade and eventually kills Teta through his disregard of lower classes. Delita avenges her soon after.
<p></dd>
<dt>Alleyway Jack (9)</dt>
<dd>See Gilgamesh.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff3characters.html#allus">Allus, Prince</a> (3) </dt>
<dd>The son of King Gorn of Salonia was banished from the castle when Gigames took control. He enlists the help of the Heroes to regain his father and his rightful place. He ends up taking the throne himself, as circumstances would have it.
<p></dd>
<dt><a href="fftcharacters.html#alma">Alma Beoulve</a> (Tactics) </dt>
<dd>Ramza's sister is closest to him out of her brothers; they share the same mother as well as Barbaneth as their father. Alma attends the Aristocratic School in Eagrose with Teta. She's uniquely suited (though she doesn't know it) for the Murond Glabados Church's evil schemes to revive the Bloody Angel.
<p></dd>
<dt>Alphollon Tavnazia (11)</dt>
<dd>A royal vassal of San'doria.  He was given the task of constructing a city on the newly discovered peninsula so the San'dorians could push south.  This was Tavnazia.  He was the keeper of a second tablet discovered underground, that turned out to be the "Lay of the Immortals".<p>
<dt>Alois, Senator (11)</dt>
<dd>An embezzling senator of Bastok.  Gumbah reveals his corruption which results in his removal from office, and Gumbah's recognition as the Talekeeper of the Galka.<p>  
<dt>Altana (11)</dt>
<dd>The supreme goddess, higher than all others.  According the Vana'diel creation story, her tears created the five races upon finding Vana'diel in ruins.  Evidence later uncovered shows the creation a little closer to reality - someone stole the energy of the mothercrystal to create five races, which split the crystal into five and the realm of the gods from the higher plain.  She soars on wings of freedom, while Promathia is bound in chains.  <p>
<dt><a href="ff9characters.html#amarant">Amarant Coral</a> (9), Salamander Coral (9j)</dt>
<dd>[HERO] A large and mostly silent warrior. His fighting style is a mix of Monk and Ninja, but his outlook is samurai - his mind is filled with rules of fighting, the biggest one of them being Look Out For Number One and let the rest go hang. He starts off life as a security guard for Treno's auction house, but a chance encounter with Zidane of Tantalus changes his whole ideal. He searches Zidane out, only from curiosity, looking for the thing which so fascinated him, something he just couldn't understand. After challenging Zidane to a fight and losing, and yet not being killed by him, his confusion just grows. He's curt and never has a nice word to say, but sometimes what's not said is even more important than trying to speak your emotions. Even at the end, he never veers from his morals, but he does grow to respect the fact that other morals do exist.<p></dd>
<dt>Amidatty (CC)</dt>
<dd>Leader of the Caravan from Shella, Amidatty is a Yuke researcher. He, along with the caravan, travels the world in search of the mysteries behind the miasma plaguing the world. As they uncover these 'truths', Amidatty devises a theory on how the world is like a loaf of Bannock bread - it was fresh when he put it in his bag, but over time, began to mold and decay. The party can really shock this caravan if they choose to take a bite out of the model. Amidatty is apparently quite a popular Yuke as he has a devoted girlfriend in Shella named Eleanor who will extoll on his discoveries and theories. The other members of the Shella caravan are named: Yufina (female), Bessamzan (male), and Leonamiel (female).<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff4characters.html#anna">Anna</a> (4) </dt>
<dd>Tellah's daughter elopes with Edward (whom Tellah thinks is just a lowly bard). She is killed when Golbez's Red Wings strafe Damcyan Castle, and she protects Edward with her body. She serves as Edward's inspiration to be brave in battle.<p></dd>
<dt>Apururu (11)</dt>
<dd>Sister of Ajido-Marujido, head of the Ministry of Maunastery.  She enlisted the help of Shantotto after her brother was captured.  Using the five rings of the ministers to form a gauntlet.  She succeeded in freeing her brother, but when he was saved he fell unconscious.  <p>
<dt><a href="ffmqcharacters.html#arion">Arion</a> (MQ) </dt>
<dd>Reuben's father, a miner who knows all about strange rocks.<p></dd>
<dt>Ark Angels (11)</dt>
<dd>Also known as the crystal warriors.  They were created by Promathia to represent the central vice of each of the five races - the arrogance of the Elvaan, the apathy of the Hume, the envy of the Mithra, the cowardice of the TaruTaru, the rage of the Galka.  The Zilart reconsructed them to protect the mother crystals, but they were warped into something different after the Meltdown.  They were summoned by Kam'lanaut to fight for him while he enacted his plan to open the gates to paradise, and were eventually defeated by Lion, Zeid, and Aldo.<p>
<dt><a href="ff9characters.html#artania">Artania, Minister</a> (9)</dt>

<dd>A purple moogle who runs the Mognet mail service. His coat is looking unaccountably shiny lately, and people are wondering why Mognet has stopped working...<p></dd>
<dt>Artemecion (cc)</dt>
<dd>Either a crossover or simply a homage to another inky-coated moogle from Final Fantasy IX, Artemecion is the moogle member of the Striped Brigands band of thieves. He's still self-centered and accident prone, and makes a perfect addition to the incompetent team of bandits. Occasionally, this team manages to steal some fruit from the caravan.<p></dd>

<br>Originally a high-spirited, naive guardian assigned to Lord Braska. Auron accompanied Braska and Jecht all the way to Zanarkand, where he learned the truth about the Final Summoning. He attacked Yunalesca and was killed, but was never Sent. His last promise to Jecht was to protect Tidus, Jecht's son, so he traveled to the dreamworld Zanarkand. Jecht as Sin visited Zanarkand and brought Tidus into Spira. Auron fulfilled his vow to Jecht by protecting Tidus and Yuna throughout Yuna's pilgrimage. Auron became somewhat of a legend after Braska's pilgramige, and other guardians (such as Dona's Barthello) revere him.
<br>PERSONALITY:
<br>Auron's original good spirits and high ideals were dashed down after death, and he became a rather morose straight-shooter. He doesn't speak often, but he has a piercing sight into matters and usually sees deeper than most people do. He doesn't beat around the bush; when he has something to say, he'll say it... and he's usually right. He gets all the cool lines, too. 8p He's intensely shamed about his actions with Braska and avoids the issue among company. In battle he's the strongest character in the game, with armor-piercing weapons, but rather slow. He carries a flask of saki (rice wine) and keeps his sword arm in his shirt; these are both signs of a ronin - a samurai without a master - which he adopted once Braska was killed. Auron is voiced by Matt McKenzie.<p></dd>
<dt>Ayame (11)</dt>
<dd>A hume samurai, one of the Mythril Musketeers.  Daughter of Ensetsu.  She competes with Iron Eater and Naji to be leader.  It was revealed that she formerly held loyalty to Gilgamesh when she was sent to Norg to negotiate trade.  Her role is representative of the Republic in negotiations.  <p>
<dt>Ayde (X-2)</dt>
<dd>Lian's more taciturn friend, who runs away with him on a journey through Spira to search for a cure for Kimahri's horn. He doesn't find it, but does find insight. Voiced by Dee Bradley Baker.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="fftacharacters.html#babus">Babus Swain</a> (TA)</dt>
<dd>The faithful nu mou retainer to Prince Mewt, who's held the position for many years (despite the fact that he hasn't even existed for that long). A Runeseeker by class, and a stuff-shirt by disposition. He fights Marche a few times, but after the game's over he'll join your clan.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff1characters.html#bahamut">Bahamut</a> (1; 3-8 plus Tactics as Summon) </dt>
<dd>The king of dragons gives the honor of a class change if you bring him a Rat's Tail. See <a href="espmon/bahamut.html">Summons</a> for more info.<p></dd>
<dt>Bahamut (11)</dt>
<dd>Also known as the wyrmking and lord of the skies.  Promathia awoke him to attack the Zilart when they opened the gateway to paradise.  He awoke the other avatars and they fought a gigantic battle in sky, during which the dawn maidens and Kuluu enacted their plan to sabotage the magic reactor.  After the magic explosion, he was still at large, terrorizing the land.  A young boy (later revealed to be Nag'molada) made a mysterious deal with him, and he left.  He returns somehow later in the Chains of Promathia storyline.  His plan is to destroy Vana'diel so that if Promathia is resurrected, there will be no life left for him to envelop.  <p>
<dt><a href="ff4characters.html#Baigan">Baigan</a> (4) </dt>
<dd>The Captain of Guards of Baron, Baigan is a snitch, a faker, and not a very nice-looking person either. He squeals on Cecil, getting him demoted, then he attacks him when he makes his way into the castle to defeat the king.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff11characters.html#bakgodek">Bakgodek, Overlord</a> (11)</dt>
<dd>Orc leader who appears in the Monastic Cavern in Davoi, the base of the Orcs.<p>
<dt><a href="ff9characters.html#baku">Baku (9)</a></dt>
<dd>The hearty, bearded leader of the Tantalus troupe. His bark is worse than his bite - or rather, he usually holds back to those he loves, which includes Zidane (his adopted son), despite what he might say to him. He respects Zidane's motives, but doesn't want to show it. He plays King Leo in the play "I Want To Be Your Canary".<p></dd>
<dt><a href="fftcharacters.html#balbanes">Balbanes Beoulve</a> (Tactics) </dt>
<dd>The leader of Eagrose and the Order of the Northern Sky during the Fifty Year War achieved the highest order of Heavenly Knight. His bravery and battle prowess helped to instigate the treaty which ended the War. He was poisoned in the latter part of the war (by his son Dycedarg as we later find out) and dies soon after the War ends.
<p></dd>
<dt>Bal Dat (CC)</dt>
<dd>The leader of the Striped Brigands, Bal Dat is a red-haired Selkie who travels the world, not for Myrrh, but for fame and fortune as a skilled thief. His band of followers is small (only three, including himself), but he's dedicated. His code of morals doesn't seem too greatly different from most Selkies, but he's the only one in the game who actually takes part in thievery of any sort.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="fftcharacters.html#balk">Barich Fendsor</a> (Tactics)</dt>
<dd>An Machinist from the Clockwork City of Goug who joined the Knights Templar. He was blacklisted by the royal knights for anti-aristocratic actions. He was killed in the Beddha Sandwaste, but is later brought back to life to guard Murond Death City.
<p></dd>
<dt><a href="fftcharacters.html#balmafula">Valmafra Lenande</a> (Tactics)</dt>
<dd>A magician sent by the Glabados Church; firstly, to help Delita with his goals, and secondly, to spy on him. If Delita's ambitions turned against the Church (as they ultimately did) she was to kill him. However, she found herself falling for him, and could not raise the blade to strike.
<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff6characters.html#banon">Banon</a> (6) </dt>
<dd>[HERO] The leader of the Returners is surprisingly weak in battle, but he's got some nice healing powers. He's very intelligent and kind-hearted, and sees Terra as more than just a tool to use agains the Empire.<p></dd>
<dt>Balias (Tactics)
<dd>The first disciple of St. Ajora, he was chased by the Holy Empire of Yudora and eventually was executed on Baraius Hill.<p>
<dt><a href="ff10characters.html#baralai">Baralai</a> (X-2)</dt>
<dd>The young leader of New Yevon also used to be a member of the Crimson Squad. Although he's noble, he tends to guard Yevon's secrets a bit too closely, causing much acrominy between him and his former compatriot, Nooj. Shuyin eventually possesses him and takes him to the Farplane. Baralai is voiced by Josh Gomez.<p></dd>
<dt>Baram (6) </dt>
<dd>Clyde's former ally, he was struck down in battle. He begged Clyde to end his pain, but Clyde ran away. Ever since, Clyde, a.k.a. Shadow, has been haunted by dreams of his deceased compatriot.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="fftcharacters.html#barinten">Barrington, Grand Duke Gerrith (Tactics)</a>/ Barinten, Grand Duke Gelkanis (PSX)</dt>
<dd>The leader of Fovoham and owner of Riovanes Castle, Barrington is known as the "Weapon King" for his eagerness and prowess in all types of weapons. He brought up Marach and Rapha, but both of them eventually turned against him after finding out his past atrocities. During the Fifty Year War, he headed a band of assassins called Ryomoku; Marach and Rapha were the strongest members of the group. He sides with the Glabados Church, but after trying to steal a Holy Stone, he is killed by Folmarv.
<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff10characters.html#barkeep">Barkeep</a> (X-2)</dt>
<dd>[X-2] The Hypello barkeeper of the Gullwings' Celsius airship is a funny little fella, just like everyone else of his race. He has a sweetie-pie who comes on board in chapter 5 (maybe).<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff7characters.html#barret">Barret Wallace</a> (7), Barrett Wallace (7j) </dt>
<dd>[HERO] The dark-skinned leader of AVALANCHE is a trash-talkin', go-get-'em type of leader. The gun-arm he got grafted onto him makes him a powerful force in battle. He harbors deep hatred towards Shinra for needlessly torching his town, North Corel. He cares deeply for his daughter Marlene.<p></dd>

<dt><a href="ff10characters.html#barthello">Barthello</a> (10/X-2)</dt>
<dd>Dona's bullish guardian who also doubles as her... I dunno, what's the word for "lover" if you take out the "love"? 8p He idolizes Auron (and degenerates into a slobbering mess when he meets him) and almost never speaks. Good thing, too, since he's never been known to say anything intelligent. Barthello is voiced by John DeMita.
<br>[X-2] Barthello later joins New Yevon - which conflicts with Dona's joining the Youth League. Much to-do is made of their tiff and subsequent reuniting.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff5characters.html#butz">Bartz Klauser (5)</a></dt>
<dd>[HERO] Hailing from the town of Rikks, Bartz is the son of Drogan and Stella Klauser. Drogan was a Warrior of the Dawn, and Bartz has been chosen as one of the four Crystal Warriors. He's an easygoing guy with an unfortunate fear of heights, and a propensity to get crushes on any female he meets.<p></dd>
<dt>Bayra (X-2)</dt>
<dd>The serious leader (and harpist) of the Macalania musical troupe. Voiced by Phil Proctor.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff9characters.html#beatrix">Beatrix, General (9)</a></dt>
<dd>A powerful and noble knight, the head of the female Alexandrian troops. She works for Queen Brahne without compunctions, disdaining the weakness of her enemies, until Kuja's works begin to really show themselves and she begins to have doubts. Eventually she goes over to the right side. Although almost completely oblivious to Steiner's feelings for her, she doesn't mind in the least once he finally says something about it.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff10characters.html#beclem">Beclem</a> (X-2)</dt>
<dd>A hard-talking Youth League member who arrives in Besaid to train up the lackadaisical Aurochs for Youth League duty. It's an uphill battle for him. He's an old war buddy of Chappu, who constantly praised Wakka, so when he actually meets Wakka he's sorely disappointed. He does have some respect for him, though, and appreciates his desire to protect those he's close to, although he insults his actual ability to do so. Voiced by Adam Paul.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff10characters.html#belgemine">Belgemine</a> (10)</dt>
<dd>A summoner (looking rather like Princess Leia) who's great at using her Aeons in battle. She constantly tests Yuna's ability to fight with her Aeons. Eventually we find out her home is in Remiem Temple, and she's yet another Unsent. Yuna agrees to Send her after she's defeated all of her Aeons. Voiced by Cree Summer.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff9characters.html#benero">Benero</a> (9)</dt>
<dd>One of the three Nero brothers, members of Tantalus. He has a kind of dog-head and claw grips, and apparently says everything with an exclamation mark.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ffmqcharacters.html#benjamin">Benjamin</a> (MQ) </dt>
<dd>[HERO] The generic boy hero of MQ. Not much to say, really. He's got a decent sense of humor but nowhere to practice it.<p></dd>
<dt>Benzo (X-2)</dt>
<dd>The Al Bhed translator living in Bikanel; the only guy who can understand Cactuar language. Voiced by Dee Bradley Baker.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="fftcharacters.html#beowulf">Beowulf Kadmas</a> (Tactics) </dt>
<dd>[HERO] The former leader of the Lionel Holy Knights was branded a heretic by Priest Bremondt, who was jealous of his bond with Reis. Bremondt's curse turned Reis into a dragon and sent Beowulf forever searching for her, finally to find her at the Mining Town of Gollund.
<p></dd>
<dt><a href="fftcharacters.html#besrodio">Besrudio Bunansa</a> (Tactics)/Besrodio Bunanza (PSX) </dt>
<dd>Mustadio's father found a Holy Stone while poking around the Clockwork City of Goug Mines. Baert Trading Company got wind of this and began chasing him, trying to get ahold of the Stone. Mustadio called in the cavalry of Ramza and co. and saved his father. Besrudio later found two strange machines in the Clockwork City of Goug - one of them was Construct 8, and the other was a device to summon Cloud from his world.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff7characters.html#bigbro">Big Bro</a> (7) </dt>
<dd>A cross-dressing macho guy who owns the gym in Wall Market, and apparently people compete in squats competitions to receive his wigs as prizes. Don't ask me...<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff6characters.html#wedbig">Biggs</a> (6), Vicks (6a) </dt>
<dd>A generic soldier for the Empire who gets wasted by Tritoch.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff7characters.html#biggs">Biggs</a> (7) </dt>
<dd>The karate dude in AVALANCHE, he's a real decent guy. Too bad he kicks the bucket.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff8characters.html#biggs">Biggs</a> (8) </dt>
<dd>Major Biggs of Galbadia reporting! This guy offers some nice comic relief, but he tends to send massive mechanical things after you once he's done.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff1characters.html#bikke">Bikke</a> (1)</dt>
<dd>A pirate who terrorizes the port town of Pravoca, and who gives you his ship when you beat him.<p></dd>
<dt>Bilghen (10/X-2)</dt>
<dd>The pioneer who, long ago, constructed lightning towers to allow passerby to actually, er, pass by the Thunder Plains. Unfortunately he got a bit too close to a big 'un and got friend. RIP.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff10characters.html#biran">Biran Ronso</a> (10)</dt>
<dd>An old foe of Kimahri; he was actually the one who broke his horn years ago, forcing Kimahri to leave in disgrace. When Kimahri returns and beats Biran, though, you can't call him a sore loser - he accepts defeat with grace and dignity.<p></dd>
<dt>Black Knight (CC)</dt>
<dd>A Lilty warrior trying to get back the memories of his lost family. He travels the world, mad with confusion, fighting against 'imaginary' monsters. It's said that he has the strength of 20 Lilty warriors and battles in a frenzy. At one point, he is hired by a priest named Hurdy to investigate a swamp that might have clues involving the missing memories. When the party finally comes across him, he is in the midst of finding his answer with his inner demons, before a young Lilty ends his life to avenge his father.<br>* Leon Esla, the Lilty who finally killed the Black Knight to avenge is father, was in fact, the Black Knight's son.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff9characters.html#waltz">Black Waltz 1, 2, 3</a> (9)</dt>
<dd>Big, buffed-up versions of Kuja's Black Mages, with wings. They're "programmed" to chase after Princess Garnet and capture her alive by any means necessary.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff9characters.html#blank">Blank</a> (9)</dt>
<dd>Marcus's brother and another member of Tantalus. He wears some kind of band across his eyes (whoo, Geordie!). His bravery in the Evil Forest ends up in his petrification, and Marcus searches the world over for an item called Supersoft to restore him. He wields a sword and can steal from enemies.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="fftcharacters.html#blansh">Blansh</a> (Tactics)
<dd>An aide to Prince Goltana.<p></dd>
<dt>Bobba (10)</dt>
<dd>One of those two damn annoying announcers in Luca.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff5characters.html#boco">Boco/Boko</a> (5, 8, Tactics) </dt>
<dd>Bartz's cute chocobo from the First World who carries on a romantic relationship with Koko. Boko also shows up as a generic fighting Chocobo in both 8 and Tactics.<p></dd>
<dt><i><a href="ffucharacters.html#bolbol">Bolbol</a> (FFU)</i></dt>
<dd>A weird (and possibly gay) clothier living near Telos who has the ability to make Flight Water clothes for exorbitent prices. Ru befriends him when she finds him.<p>
<dt><a href="fftcharacters.html#bolmna">Bolmna</a> (Tactics)

<dt><a href="ff2characters.html#borgan">Borghen</a> (2), Borgan (2j)

<dt><a href="ff9characters.html#brahne">Brahne, Queen</a> (9)</dt>
<dd>The obese, green-skinned ruler of Alexandria was supposedly a kind creature before Kuja gave her an overweening sense of greed. She proceeds to exploit everyone and everything, even her adopted daughter's eidolons, to reach her goals. She's not destined to win her war, though.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff10characters.html#braska">Braska, High Summoner</a> (10/X-2)</dt>
<dd>Yuna's father ended up being the last summoner to call the Final Aeon and lose his life in the process. Although an honorable, magnanimous, high-class individual, Braska was a bit of a maverick; he had a sense of humor. Yuna's mother was an Al Bhed, a fact that would have proved deeply embarrassing had the church of Yevon found out about it. Braska was protected on his pilgrimage by Auron and Jecht. Braska is voiced by Andy Philpot.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff10characters.html#brother">Brother</a> (10/X-2)</dt>
<dd>Rikku's Al Bhed brother... no, apparently he doesn't have a name. ^^; He's rather brash, but a decent blitzball player and a good airship pilot. He even makes a half-hearted attempt at learning English, such as it is. Voiced by David Rasner.
<br>[X-2] The "leader" of the Gullwings (although no one really listens to him), Brother has become a parody of himself with his ridiculous animations and voices. He's learned English to some extent, mainly in an attempt to impress the newly babe-arific Yuna.
<p></dd>

<dt><a href="ff10characters.html#buddy">Buddy</a> (X-2)</dt>
<dd>A dark-skinned Al Bhed, he pilots the Celsius and puts up with Brother's antics as the straight guy in the Gullwings. He's also one of the founders of the group; he and Brother were the ones who discovered the Celsius in the first place. Voiced by Ogie Banks III.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff7characters.html#elderbugah">Bugah, Elder</a> (7) </dt>
<dd>One of the two wise men in Cosmo Canyon. Him and Hargo make up Bugenhagen's name.<p></dd>
<dt>Buremonda/Bremondt, Priest (Tactics)
<dd>The jealous priest who put a curse on Reis, turning her into a dragon, and sentenced Beowulf as a heretic. Does not appear in the game.<p>
<dt><a href="ff7characters.html#bugenhagen">Bugenhagen</a> (7), Buugen Hagen (7j) </dt>
<dd>Good old Bugen is the resident wise man, although it's unnerving to hear him go "Ho Ho Hoo!" about everything. He has kind of a weird sense of humour. He's Red XIII's grandfather, which raises a lot of questions, let me tell you. He enjoys both nature and machinery, an anomaly in RPGs.<p></dd>
<dt>Butz (5j)</dt>
<dd>See Bartz Klauser (5).<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff11characters.html#byakko">Byakko</a> (11)</dt>
<dd>A "god" tiger that appears when you trade the Gem of the West and an Autumnstone.<p>
<dt><i><a href="ffucharacters.html#cactuar">Cactuar</a> (FFU)</i></dt>
<dd>Cute, lovable Cactuar! The Cactuars all live in a village in a desert where they try to defeat the "wandering ocean" who keeps them from seeing the sun. As you might expect, they can shoot needles from their bodies and are extremely fast (running without actually moving their limbs) - and they hate water. The sound they make is a kind of squeak that sounds like "geKA!".<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff4characters.html#cagnazzo">Cagnazzo</a> (4), Kainazzo (4a) </dt>
<dd>The Emperor/Fiend of Water looks like a giant blue turtle. He was the one who took over the kingdom of Baron by killing the king, Odin, and disguising himself as the king. He then let Golbez come in and wreak havoc. His name comes from Dante's Inferno, an ancient work.<p></dd>
<dt>Cain (4j)</dt>
<dd>See Kain (4).<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff7characters.html#caitsith">Cait Sith</a> (7) </dt>
<dd>[HERO] This cute little guy is described as a "Toysaurus" which doesn't mean anything at all. He's a toy cat riding a giant Mog. (See the <a href="species.html">Species</a> page for an explanation of this.) He starts out talking normally, but at the end of the game degenerates into southern drawl. He uses a megaphone and his Mog to attack in battle. He enjoys fortune telling. In reality, he's Reeve, head of the Shinra Urban Development Section. He originally joined Cloud to spy for Shinra, but he joins him wholeheartedly later. The name Cait Sith is taken from an enemy (a palette swap of Cuar) from 4; it was also used as the name of a Summon from 6. Lulu from 10 could use Cait Sith dolls to attack the enemy!<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff10characters.html#calli">Calli</a> (10/X-2)</dt>
<dd>A little girl met by Tidus and Yuna while on Mi'ihen Highroad.
<br>[X-2] All grown up now, Calli hangs around the Mi'ihen Highroad and yearns to ride Chocobos along it again. Voiced by Cree Summer.<p></dd>
<dt>Cararu/Cara (5j)</dt>
<dd>See Krile Maia Baldesion.<p></dd>
<dt>Caraway, General (8) </dt>
<dd>Rinoa's stern father who's all but disowned her. He's a top brass in the Galbadian army and she's a dissenter. Go figure.<p></dd>
<dt>Carbuncle (11)</dt>
<dd>One of the avatars, keeper of the world and keeper of rainbows.  Involved in the side quest for Summoner's artifact armor.<p>
<dt>Card Queen (8) </dt>
<dd>A gameplay element who flits from place to place, often not telling you where she's going, and forcing you to follow her doggedly to pick up a few almost-not-worth-it cards.<p></dd>
<dt>Cardians (11)</dt>
<dd>Dolls brought to life by the strange fruit of the trees on the Windurst Walls.  They became grunts for work and war, and held loyalty only to Zonpa-Zippa.  Eventually, they grew out of control, so Zonpa-Zippa made the Ace Cardians to manage them.  <p>
<dt><a href="ff4characters.html#cecil">Cecil</a> (4) </dt>
<dd>[HERO] Cecil was raised with his friend Kain by the king of Baron. The king taught Cecil the art of the Dark Sword. His skills eventually became so great that he was appointed the leader of Baron's Red Wings airship squad. However, the king's orders to him become more and more erratic, and Cecil begins to have doubts about his king's honor when he is ordered to torch a peaceful Mysidia and steal the Water Crystal. Cecil is dogged by his own sense of morals throughout the game, until he becomes a Paladin and leaves his dark art. We find out much later that Cecil is the son of KluYa, a Lunarian (which makes FuSoYa his uncle) and the brother of Golbez. Rosa is his lover.<p></dd>
<dt>Cecil (CC)</dt>
<dd>The Clavat Elder of Marr's Pass.  He seems to think he's quite the ladies' man, despite his age. His granddaughter, Rashe, thinks he's a little senile.<p></dd>
<dt>Cefca Palazzo (6j)</dt>
<dd>See Kefka (6).<p></dd>
<dt><a href="fftcharacters.html#celia">Celia</a> (Tactics)</dt>
<dd>An Assassin who aids Marquis Elmdore; later found out to be an Ultima Demon summoned by Zarela, Elmdore's Lucavi alterego.
<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff6characters.html#celes">Celes Chere</a> (6) </dt>
<dd>[HERO] A pure knight who defected from the Empire to join the Returners. Celes' beauty is astonishing for a warrior, and Locke is infatuated with her when he decides to rescue her from the Empire's hands. She has a very good heart and will take the right path no matter what the consequences.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff1characters.html#chaos">Chaos</a> (1) </dt>
<dd>[VILLAIN] The ultimate evil, a big guy with wings. Incidentally, one of Vincent's Limit Breaks in 7 allows him to turn into Chaos. Kind of cheap, isn't it? 8-)<p></dd>
<dt><i>Chaos (FFU)</i></dt>
<dd>See Earl, Tyrant.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff10characters.html#chappu">Chappu</a> (10/X-2)</dt>
<dd>Wakka's little brother was also Lulu's sweetheart, if you can believe it. One day Luzzu convinced him to join the Crusaders. When he went into battle with the fiends, he was using an Al Bhed machina weapon instead of the tried-and-true Brotherhood sword... he never came back. Wakka never forgave the Crusaders or the Al Bhed, and his Blitzball was shot to hell after that. Tidus apparently looks just like Chappu (I can't see the similarity, meself).<p></dd>
<dt>Chebukki Triplets (11)</dt>
<dd>Makki, Kukki, Cherukiki.  These trouble-making Tarutaru triplets are on a constant search for their father.  Through the events of Chains of Promathia they wind up fighting alongside and against the heroes, making their alliance to good or evil ambiguous.  After Promathia is destroyed, they are thrown off a ship for stowing away, and find their real father.  They are currently under the care of Prishe.  <p>
<dt><i><a href="ffucharacters.html#chobi">Chobi</a> (FFU)</i></dt>
<dd>A wacko Chocobo picked up by Yu on his first outing in the Inner World. Chobi is full of idiosyncrasies: the tendency to grab Ai by her pigtail and run around with her; an illogical affinity for the giant, super-spicy Dead Peppers, which cause it to breathe fire and run around screaming; and the ability to jump at an enemy and kick it to bits (just like the Chocobo Kick summon!) He wears Isabel, the Inner World clock made by Sid, around his neck; it was apparently placed there by Oscar as a tracking device. The clock also allows Yu, Ai, and Lisa to anticipate when and where the interdimensional subway will go next. At one point, he encounters the ancient Ciel ruins, which gives him the power to transform into the legendary Ciel Chocobo, which can fly. Incidentally, he's voiced by the same person as Earl Tyrant.<p>
<dt><a href="ff9characters.html#choco">Choco</a> (9)</dt>
<dd>Zidane's chocobo friend, who goes on a long quest to find the Chocobo Paradise, only to decide he likes Zidane better. Go figure.<p></dd>

<dt><i><a href="ffucharacters.html#chocobaba">Chocobaba</a> (FFU)</i></dt>
<dd>An extremely whacked-out old lady riding a chocobo, whose repertoire of conversation consists of "So the rumours say" and "It never ends..."<p></dd>
<dt><i><a href="ffucharacters.html#chocoimo">Chocoimo</a> (FFU)</i></dt>
<dd>Chocobaba's younger sister (if you can believe that). She's just as wacky as her sister, and her own conversation is "I don't know..." and "or something like that". 8p She's even voiced by the same person as her sister.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff7characters.html#chocobosage">Chocobo Sage</a> (7) </dt>
<dd>A strange purple old man who lives in a secluded hut, he knows everything there is to know about special chocobos... that is, if he can remember it, durnit...<p></dd>
<dt>Chocoboy (8) </dt>
<dd>A little kid who runs the Chocobo Forest puzzles.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff7characters.html#chole">Chole</a> (7) </dt>

<dd>The creator and owner of the world's only airship, the Dreadnought, lives in Poft. He gives rides for overblown charges. Much later in the game, after an attack by Paramecia's Whirlwind, he gives the airplane to the heroes with his last breath.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff3characters.html#cid">Cid</a> (3) </dt>
<dd>The funny-looking engineer is the mastermind of airships on the Floating Continent. This overblown little man works for the king of Argass and utilizes the Time Gear to make airships. He was stuck in Kazus under the spell of Jinn (causing him to become a two-dimensional ghost), but was helped out by the Heroes.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff4characters.html#cid">Cid</a> (4) </dt>
<dd>[HERO] The mastermind behind Baron's Red Wings airship squadron, he's a crusty man, fairly old, who nevertheless has the work ethic of an entire anthill. He overworks himself several times throughout the game, risking his life, but he's tough as nails. He lives with his daughter in Baron Town.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff5characters.html#cid">Cid Previa</a> (5) </dt>
<dd>A mechanical genius, Cid was the one who built Karnak's Fire Ship. Because the Crystal began to fail, they locked him up. Bartz (who was locked up in an adjacent cell) escaped with his help. Later, Cid and his grandson Mid (who followed in his footsteps) take up residence in a Ranka ruin called the Airship Base; they were the brains who got the Airship up and running.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff6characters.html#cid">Cid</a> (6) </dt>
<dd>The brains behind the Magicite operation, he works wonders for the Empire before realizing just what they're planning on doing with it. After meeting Locke and the gang, he quits his day job and joins the Returners. He's known Celes since she was a child and sees her as a daughter or granddaughter.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff7characters.html#cid">Cid Highwind</a> (7) </dt>
<dd>[HERO] A rough, crusty middle-aged aviator. His dream was always to go into space, but thanks to a bit of extra spot-checking by his underling Shera, who put herself in danger to make sure the launch went through, he ended up scrapping the whole project. He never really forgave her. His technological prowess, like all Cids, is unmatched. He can pilot anything. He uses a spear in battle and he's never without a cigarette.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff8characters.html#cid">Cid Kramer</a> (8) </dt>
<dd>He looks too nice to head a military academy, but there he is. He can be quite forceful when push comes to shove, but he's a bit of a coward. He started the orphanage with his wife Edea, but was forced to transform it into Garden when she was possessed by Ultimecia. Having to live with the fact that he might have to order his wife's death is not a nice feeling. When danger from Galbadia threatens, he runs.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff9characters.html#cid">Cid Fabool IX</a> (9)</dt>
<dd>The ruler of Lindblum and airship genius extraordinaire... well, he would be, except that his wife Hilda turned him into an oglop because he carried on an affair. An attempt at restoring him midway through the game just turns him into a frog. Shame, because he can't think well without his human brain. He's still an expert at Tetra Master, though. Don't worry, eventually he does get turned back to a human.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff10characters.html#cid">Cid</a> (10/X-2)</dt>
<dd>The leader of the Al Bhed is bald as a billiard ball and speaks like Yosemite Sam. He cares deeply for his niece Yuna and his daughter Rikku, and is fiercely protective of them. He's a whiz with machina, like all Al Bhed. Strong, cynical, and quite the hard-liner. He was the brains behind the "kidnap the summoners so they won't kill themselves" movement, a cause which he feels quite close to, since Yuna's on the same quest. Cid is voiced by Michael McShane.
<br>[X-2] For some odd reason, Cid finds it useful to parade the Zanarkand Ruins as a tourist attraction; he hires Isaaru to be the main event. Naturally, Yuna gets annoyed by this and tells him off. He spends most of the game sulking in the Thunder Plains, at which point he has to get rescued by his daughter and niece from a nasty monster. After this, he comes onboard the Celsius and makes a pain out of himself fighting with Brother et al.
<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff11characters.html#cid">Cid</a> (11)</dt>
<dd>An engineering genius (like all Cid's before him), and figured to be the smartest man in the world.  He originally made his fortune from studying ancient Zilart technology and using it in his inventions.  When he found a mysterious crystal in the Northlands, he sent the ill-fated mission there to see if there was more.  This piece actually turned out to be a chunk of the Star of Tavnazia.  Using the knowledge he gained from his studies, he developed a crystal engine that would eventually power airships.  During their development, he worked with figures in hooded robes that may have been Zilart.  The Archduke of Jeuno commissioned him to build a fleet of airships to be used in the Crystal War, but only one was ever publicly used or needed.<p>

<dd>Mewt's father IRL becomes the Judgemaster in Ivalice. It's just what he needs to perk his spirits up after his wife died, because back in the real world he cuts a pretty pathetic figure. However, his ethics are superb, and he goes as far as to cut himself off from the palace (and his "wife" and son) to ensure that no one is above the law. After finishing all 300 missions, Cid will join Marche to sock it to a bunch of renegade Judges.<p></dd>

<dt><i><a href="ffucharacters.html#cid">Cid</a> (FFU)</i></dt>
<dd>This version's Sid is a cheerful, optimistic, and energetic technician, a wizard at anything electronic. He carries around weird high-tech equipment and inventions wherever he goes (some of them can pack quite a punch!) He names his inventions after females and has a way-too-close connection with them. He has his own insignia, and wears neato specs. He's the brains behind the Comodin. You DON'T want to be around him when he gets mad (he pulls all kinds of crazy gadgets out of his backpack and gets medieval on whosever's ass is around). A rather hilarious episode in which he gets turned into a frog ends up with a kiss between him and Mireth, and their relationship has been rather strained since then. 8p<p></dd>

<dd>The last hapless Chocobo Knight, who's great with Chocobos but is a wimp in battle. He (possibly) ends up becoming a Chocobo Breeder instead of a Knight. Voiced by Matt Miller.
<br>[X-2] With the rest of the Chocobo Knights joining the Youth League, Clasko does as well, though he's still unhappy. After tailing around Yuna for a while, he finally realizes his true calling as a Chocobo breeder and makes a ranch where the Monster Arena used to be.

<dd>[HERO] The very dedicated hero of 7 (although to what, he's not always entirely sure). He sports a wacked hairdo and a purple SOLDIER outfit. He likes using big swords. He starts out being kind of a loner, but for some reason all the ladies find him sexy and he comes out of his shell a bit. He's bent on a) destroying Sephiroth and b) finding out just who the hell he is. He also makes a surprise appearance as a playable character in Tactics, after finishing a complicated optional sequence of events. <p></dd>

<dt><a href="ff7characters.html#corneo">Corneo, Don</a> (7) </dt>
<dd>I think Don is his first name, because he doesn't quite strike you as a Godfather type of guy. He loves cigars and women (getting a good picture yet?) He likes asking people inane questions and then dropping them down into sewers. I think the Corneo part comes from the word "carnal".<p></dd>

<dd>A fairy marionette brought to life by Oscar and sent to spy on Kaze and friends, and report to whichever of Earl Tyrant's minions happens to be around. Her entire vocabulary seems to be "kukuruyu", which sounds like a dove's cooing. She's not quite mindless, though... in fact, if it weren't for her the series would have ended quite differently. Incidentally, she's voiced by the same actor as Fabra.<p></dd>
<dt>Curilla, General (11)</dt>

<dd>[HERO] A throwback from another era, Cyan speaks and acts like a knight out of Victorian times. His ancient talk and practices throw some people off sometimes. Retainer to the king of Doma, he was forced to watch as Kefka poisoned his king, and his wife and child. Burning with vengeance, he vows to avenge their deaths. His prudent values sometimes turn out to be a bit embarrassing for him.<p></dd>
<dt>D'Oraguille, Achefagais (11)</dt>
<dd>The ninth king of San'Doria.  He ruled from 558-567.  He received the crown after he personally assassinated his stepbrother, who had more claim to the throne than he did.  Called "The War King" for his ferocity in battle, he was loved as a warrior, but hated as an aristocrat.  He died on the throne.<p>
<dt>D'Oraguille, Lanfeaur (11)</dt>
<dd>Elvaan.  The ruling party at the time of the discovery of a small peninsula at western edge of Quon continent.  This peninsula would eventually become Tavnazia.  He also held one of the tablets that told where Lightbringer was. <p>
<dt>D'Oraguille, Marelinne R (11)</dt>
<dd>The ruler of San'Doria after Acheufagai D'Oraguille.  Her claim to the throne was discovered just before a bloody civil war broke out.  Disgusted with the deception and schemes around her, she left the kingdom and journeyed the land, ruling from afar by messenter.  She vanished after a twenty-year reign.<p>
<dt>D'Oraguille, Ranperre R (11)</dt>
<dd>Nicknamed the "dragon king".  With his dragoons, he led the final assault on the San'doria.  He discovered the secret of Lanfeaur D'Oraguille's tablet, revealing the location of Lightbringer, a powerful sword.  The presence of this weapon caused the royal knights to surrender without it ever being brought out and ended the civil war threatening to plunge San'doria into bloody conflict directly after their defeat by Bastok.  Believing Lightbringer was too much power for him to wield, he sent it to Tavnazia and had it locked away in its caverns.  Ancient lore says that he saved a black dragon from death, and as a result a dragon would protect his tomb.<p>
<dt><a href="ff9characters.html#dagger">Dagger</a> (9)</dt>
<dd>[HERO] That's the name Princess Garnet chooses for herself when she travels with Zidane and his ragtag bunch. Born to the name Sarah in the summoner village of Madain Sari (and born with a horn), Garnet escaped the horror which destroyed Madain Sari (by Garland's Invincible) and floated to Alexandria in a boat. She bore an incredible resemblance to the recently-deceased Princess Garnet, and was adopted by the king and queen; her horn was subsequently removed. As her sixteenth birthday approaches, she becomes more and more fidgety and resolves to leave Alexandria and her brocade prison. She implores Zidane to capture her (funny, that's what he was gonna do anyway!). A fairly naive and kind-hearted person, Dagger tries hard to fit in wherever she can (and eventually succeeds, more or less). Her feelings for Zidane initially waver between attraction and annoyance, but eventually resolve themselves. She uses rackets and rods in battle, and can use both white magic and summon eidolons.<p></dd>

Somehow, though, they always get the job done, and if you visit them after they've completed for the year, they'll ask you to join in on their dancing festivities, which is always fun. Dah Vis plays the instruments while Mana Kohl leads the dancing.<p></dd>

<dd>[HERO/VILLAIN] Born to a poor farmer on a fief on the Barbaneth' land, Delita became friends with Ramza. Barbaneth appointed Delita to be Ramza's assistant and used his pull to get him into the Gariland Military Academy. Delita is very close to his sister Teta, and her death by Argath's hand sends him into a smoldering rage. Delita's low rank continually irks him, especially from the jibes Argath gives him; after Teta's death, something snaps in him and he vows never to be manipulated again. He's extremely crafty and clever, and ends up using everyone and everything for his own will. He assassinates Goltanna and blames it on Orlandeau; his ingratiation to anyone currently in power eventually gains him the title of Holy Knight, then leadership of the Order of the Southern Sky, then the throne. He harbors true feelings for Ovelia, however. Although he does not agree with the Glabados Church, his goals nevertheless coincide with theirs for a time.<p></dd>

He turns about to be the real mastermind behind the present day plan to open the path to paradise, including starting the Crystal War from behind the throne of the Shadow Lord, and also using his ability to read minds.

<dd>[VILLAIN/HERO] Edea's original motives were all for the best. A very high-class woman, she started an orphanage with her husband, Cid. However, that all changed when she inherited the powers of Sorceress Ultimecia (via a bend in time) and became a sorceress herself. She realized the problems this could cause.

In an effort to stop the bloody war between nations, he conspired with the leaders of Bastok to dethrone his brother in exchange for a ceasefire.

The soldiers of Bastok and Fellenant's temple knights succeeded in taking the castle up to the point of seizing King Raigegue, when Fellenant had a vision from the Scepter and surrendered.

However, she goes about it by running away and travelling the world in disguise, much to the chagrin of her Lilty protector, Knocfelna, and his loyal dog. As a half breed, she's quite interesting, with Lilty characteristics such as flower-petal-like hair and steel-gloved arms along with a mostly-Clavat like face and body. When she returns home, she gives the party 1000 Gil each for helping her reach her conclusions.<p></dd>

<dt><i><a href="ffucharacters.html#fungus">Fungus</a> (FFU)</i></dt>
<dd>The second of the Deathlords working for Earl Tyrant; a mushroom man whose attacks deal with fungae/poison and the like. He always has a pipe in his mouth (apparently it blows out steam). He spends most of his time losing to Kaze, dying, being reincarnated at one-tenth the size, then embarrasingly waiting till he's full-size again to do anything. He's technically immortal as long as his world still exists. Part of it was absorbed by the Inner World, so when he ends up back there he uses its energy to (e.g.) grow to giant-size and try to pound things. However, the whole thing ends up being a trap by a disgruntled Count to finally kill Fungus and his world via a destructive mold, and feed him to Chaos.<p></dd>

<dd>The naive apprentice of the Besaid cadre of Crusaders, who looks up to Luzzu as a role model and is devastated when he is killed in Operation Mi'ihen.

O_o He ends up back in Besaid, leading a new batch of Crusaders (very new; most of 'em are kids).

<dt><a href="ff6characters.html#gau">Gau</a> (6) </dt>
<dd>[HERO] A wild boy living off the Veldt, he helps out Sabin and friends only when they give him some meat. Very unpredictable and extremely uncouth, Gau is nevertheless a breath of fresh air.

At one point he tries using a sword he THINKS is Excalibur against you; it's really called Excalipur and does single-digit damage. 8-) He's dressed in a wild-colored red robe thingy; he later morphs into a many-armed Kali-like menace. He's got a good heart, though - after X-death exiles him to the N-Zone, he begins to like Bartz and company. He returns in 8 (the only real cross-over character in the series) as a random Summon; Odin's Zantetsuken opens the breach to the N-Zone, allowing him to return equipped with the Excalibur, Masamune, Zantetsuken, and Excalipur. 8-) In FF9 he's a four-armed treasure hunter and card player extraordinaire, also known as Alleyway Jack.<p></dd>

<dd>One of the only real crossover characters, Gogo's kind of an intentional enigma. He's a Mimic: he repeats everything others do. He wears flashy clothes and his face is hidden in his robes. In 5, defeating him yielded the Mimic job; in 6, you could actually make him join up. In 5, he lived underwater in the fallen Walz Tower; in 6, he lived in surroundings even stranger than himself: the insides of a giant Sand Worm-like creature called the Zone Eater. The truth is that the two characters don't look and act all that alike; perhaps they come from the same world of Mimics?<p><p></dd>

A no-nonsense man who never believed in any of the spiritual mumbo-jumbo conjured up by Aki and Sid, but finds himself eventually going along with them, partly because of his observations, and partly because of his feelings for Aki.

His power goes to his head soon enough, and he begins to believe that he's some kind of messiah, and that nothing he can do goes wrong. He finds out his mistake when a "demonstration" of the Phantoms' power ends up destroying the entire New York Barrier City. He does feel intense remorse, but true to his nature, decides that action and destroying the Phantoms is a better penance. He completely shuts out anything Aki and Sid say to him, dismissing Aki as a traitor because of the Phantom inside her (whether he actually believes that or is only using it as an excuse is never quite shown). Brute force is the only method he understands.<p>

<dd>Tidus's father is, quite frankly, a boor. He's the star blitzball player in Zanarkand, but unfortunately he's well aware of it. Jecht's encounter with Sin shoved him from Zanarkand to Spira where he unexpectedly ended up guarding Braska on his pilgrimage after being thrown in jail due to a Drunk And Disorderly charge. During the journey, though, we realize certain things about him - that he wasn't as mean a lout as he used to be, that he can actually control himself when he needed to, and that he really did care about his son, though he had no idea how to show it. Tidus always has a burning hatred for his father (whom he really blames for his mother's death of "broken heart") which is never fully assuaged. Jecht surrendered himself to become Braska's Final Aeon and therefore Sin... when Tidus has to fight him in that form, the swirling emotions of love, hate, and sorrow are almost too much for him. Jecht has a <a href="../misc/jechtlogo.jpeg">large tattoo</a> on his chest, which also appears when he is in his aeon form; it also appears at the start of the game (above the words "Final Fantasy X Project"), and is on a chain worn by Tidus.

He organized a plan to explore the ancient secrets of the Tarutaru in the Horotoro Ruins, and asked Zonpa-Zippa for control of the Ace Cardians to do this.  Under his direction, he had the four Ace Cardians build Joker, a super strong Cardian, and bound his life force to it.  While in the ruins, he saw Fenrir and received a vision of Windurst in ruin.  He later built a secret Ministry of Animastery in the canals under Windurst.  He and the Star Sybil, who was with him when he received his vision, hatched a plan to try and avert this premonition, althought Karaha-Baruha secretly made his own agenda to suck the life force out of Fenrir.  He and Fenrir disappeared when this happened and was never seen again.  Until much later, at the battle of Odin's Gate in Windurst in the middle of the Crystal War.  He rode in on Fenrir, beat the Shadow Lord's forces back, then vanished forever.  Today he is thought to be a great hero.  Secretly, he is the pupeeteer siphoning the souls of avatars.

<dd>The victim of a tragic past, Kaze has been turned into a complete introvert. He barely speaks except when there's something he wants (he never replies to anyone). But he's not one to get close to - he holds unimaginable power; Oscar and Fungus both call him the "Unlimited", the one with the power to destroy the gods (hence the title of the series). He carries around two weapons; a regular red gun which can still destroy most things out there, and a Demon Gun attached to his arm. He has a strange relationship with it; he variously calls it his "heart" and his "life". It uses Soil (the crystals of those killed by Chaos) to combine three magical colored bullets into a shoukanjuu (Summoned Creature), which then decimates the enemy in various ways. Kaze's only goal (and the only thing he shows any emotion about) is to obliterate Shroi Kumo, his archenemy, who apparently headed the attack on his home world. Apparently their first battle created the dark tunnel to Tokyo, and ended up with Kaze being put to sleep for twelve years. Although Kaze generally ends up saving Ai, Yu, and Lisa from some monster, he most definitely doesn't actually care about them...with the possible exception of Lisa, whom I think reminds him of Aura, a woman in his past. He also has an uncanny ability to be where they are before they get there, even if it's technically impossible for him to do so. I believe he follows them around because Earl Tyrant is after them and Shroi Kumo works for Earl Tyrant. Oh: and he has a perfectly good eye under the patch(actually half a pair of sunglasses), a perfectly good arm under the gun, and is actually pretty scrawny under the cloak. Image is everything. 8p He also has a strange relationship with Moogle...<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff6characters.html#kefka">Kefka</a> (6), Cefca Palazzo (6j) </dt>
<dd>[VILLAIN] Possibly the most popular character in the entire series, this guy's got a plethora of complexes and one-liners which put even the most aspiring mad dictator to shame. Some of those complexes involve wearing fluorescent clothes and feathers, laughing maniacally, running away from battles he can't win, and destroying the known world. His "self-help booklet" line is one of the only real classics in the history of RPGs.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff5characters.html#kelgar">Kelga Vlondett</a> (5)</dt>
<dd>A werewolf from the Second World, Kelga was one of the Four Warriors of the Dawn. He has a suspicious nature, but he's very powerful and very brave.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff10characters.html#kimahri">Kimahri Ronso</a> (10/X-2)</dt>
<dd>HISTORY:
<br>After a tussle with Biran broke his horn off, Kimahri left Mt. Gagazet in disgrace. Auron discovered him near Bevelle and told him to take Yuna to Besaid (a promise he made to Braska) just before Auron died. Kimahri complied, but Yuna begged him to stay with her and not to leave. He did, and eventually became her guardian.
<br>PERSONALITY:
<br>Kimahri barely speaks (in fact, it takes about ten hours before he says a single word), and when he does talk it's in the typical Ronso third-person-Neanderthal-speak. He's stolid and usually has something surprising to say when he does talk. In battle Kimahri's kind of a blank slate: you can make him do anything you want, but he'll invariably be worse at it than anyone else in your party. Kimahri is voiced by John DiMaggio (same as Wakka).
<br>[X-2] Kimahri is now the Ronso Elder. Lian and Ayde, two young Ronso, have run away from home. The Ronso youth (led by Garik) are itching to fight the Guado, and Kimahri has his hands full keeping them at bay. Eventually Yuna manages to knock some sense into Garik, though, and Kimahri gets his own statue when people finally realize his leadership potential.

<dd>Originally a fighter in the Yevonite's ranks, this ingratiating, double-crossing little man weaved his way up the ranks to become Maester of Djose. He looks quite comical with a machine gun in his hand, but of course ends up being double-crossed right back by Seymour. Voiced by Roger Jackson.

<dd>[VILLAIN] A Genome from Terra, who was born with a fierce will, amazing power, and a huge ego. Garland imbued him with a soul and sent him to Gaia to wreak havoc and cause wars using his Mist-powered Black Mages. However, Kuja disdains his origins (even hiding his tail) and aims to overthrow Garland and those who would stand against him. He first tries hijacking the eidolons, and when that fails he turns to Garland's Invincible airship and its wellspring of Gaia's souls. However, the shocker Garland throws him that Kuja will soon die, drives him over the edge and he resolves that nothing in the world should survive without him. Kuja has some of the crazed theatricality of Kefka and the debonaire charm of Sephiroth, but pays homage to neither.<p></dd>

<dt><a href="ff8characters.html#laguna">Laguna Loire</a> (8) </dt>
<dd>[HERO] Not what you'd really think of being hero type, actually. Laguna's more bent on journalism, telling the world about the horrors of violence, war, and alcoholism. Although he did a stint for the Galbadian army, he spent the rest of his life righting wrongs in his own shy way. His bungles and cock-ups are legendary. 8-) He doesn't like getting too close to battle; his gun does all the damage he needs. Events point to him being the father of Squall. No one could predict the final outcome of his life: being elected President of Esthar! His name comes from the famous sword-cum-spaceship Ragnarok (or is it the other way around?), which when spelled out in Japanese sounds like Ra-gu-na-rok.<p></dd>

She goes all melty whenever anyone mentions her "Noojy-woojy" (barf).

<dd>[HERO] A young, blue-haired girl, Linaly is a direct descendant of Bartz. Although a very naive and wide-eyed youth, she nevertheless has as much bravery as her companion Prettz. This is either offset or enhanced (I haven't decided which) by the fact that her skirt is of negligble length, a fact which is taken advantage of when the Crystal of Wind decides to use her body as a summer home. She's a novice Summoner, but can't do anything besides Chocobos. Her elderly grandfather, who starts the whole anime off, communicates to her via her Ying-Yang earring.

<dt><i><a href="ffucharacters.html#lisa">Lisa Pacifist</a> (FFU)</i></dt>
<dd>A rather interesting character. Lisa jumped on the subway to the Demon World along with the Hayakawa twins. She's an "agent" sent to find the Hayakawas as well, though she doesn't reveal this till the very end of the series. In the meantime, Ai believes she's looking for her boyfriend in the Inner World. In any case, unlike Kaze, Lisa consents to travel with the twins and shows a genuine affection for them. Lisa controls a unique power called Kigenjutsu (Defender of Life), which allows her to harness the energy of nature, and she uses it to great effect whenever she can, usually to protect Ai and Yu... being careful not to overuse it, because doing so would result in her death, just like her mother did. However, she's of no use against Count's Deathlords or their stronger creatures, so Kaze usually has to step in.<p></dd>

Featuring a bandanna and heroic streak, Locke always comes to the rescue when someone's in trouble - if he's not being seasick, that is. He has pretty good morals for a thief, and a strong sense of purpose. His carefree demeanor hides an old pain - that of his girlfriend Rachel's death by accident at his hands.<p></dd>

After Kaze saves her from Omega (albeit unintentionally... I think), she develops a huge crush on him, flying in the face of all logic, and vows to search after him through the Inner World. She eventually gets a cape made of Flight Water, which lets her fly around. At the very end, her love for Kaze finally breaks through to him...<p>

<dt><a href="ff10characters.html#lulu">Lulu (10/X-2)</a></dt>
<dd>HISTORY:
<br>Lulu has apparently made a business of being a guardian for summoners; Yuna's her third pilgrimage, the first being Lady Ginnem, who died, and the second being Father Zuke, who quit. She grew up in Besaid Island (though she seems extremely out of place with the islanders). She was romantically involved with Wakka's brother, Chappu, and after his death became fairly glum; she now rarely smiles. She takes a long time to get used to Tidus because of his resemblance to Chappu. Apparently after FFX ends she becomes pregnant, but we don't know from who. *^_^*
<br>PERSONALITY:
<br>Lulu has a jaded view of the world; she doesn't try to stop people from doing what they want to do, and they leave her the hell alone. She's very knowledgable and is usually the person who explains everything to Tidus. She shares Wakka's optimism in the Yevon church, but her world-weary approach means she's not quite as broken when she sees the truth. In battle, Lulu's the main Black Mage and attacks with cute widdle dolls. Lulu is voiced by Paula Tiso.
<br>[X-2] Lulu marries Wakka, and she's pregnant for the majority of the game (although not visibly so, mainly due to programmer laziness). Eventually she gives birth to a son, Vidina.

<dd>A hardened veteran of the Crusaders, Luzzu heads the Besaid regiment, with Gatta as his sidekick. Although he comes off as a serious, hard worker, it's actually quite the facade - his motto is keep your head down, always say "sir", and nobody bothers you much. ^^; However, his sense of duty is impeccable, and he falls in battle with Sin during Operation Mi'ihen. (You can stop this from happening by convincing Gatta to fight in the front lines; then Gatta will die and Luzzu will survive and return to Besaid.) He was the one who convinced Chappu to join the Crusaders; Wakka mostly forgave him for it, though it took a lot of work. Voiced by John DeMita.<p></dd>

<dd>The first president of Bastok.  He stowed away on a ship to Bastok lands during the gold rush.  This is where he gained the nickname "Ironman Mayer" for his tireless mining.  He fought against the San'dorian army after his wife was killed and became a hero for a brilliant strategem.

<dd>An aging Selkie who, along with Bal Dat and Artemecion, forms the team of the Striped Brigands, who rob and plunder unsuspecting crystal caravans.

<dd>A rather soppy kid, who hangs on to the teddy bear his mother gave him before she died. Neither he nor his father Cid have really come to terms with it, but being bullied at school doesn't help either. Marche's dreams form the basic structure of Ivalice when it's created, and he's installed as the prince; his mother (or something that looks quite like her) comes back from the dead to watch over him. He's pretty stubborn, but eventually he does come around to realize that no matter how nice the dream is, it's not the real world.<p></dd>

He's almost as smart when it comes to machines, too. <i>Mid returns in the anime as a spirit - after Ra Devil needlessly killed him while stealing Cid's brain, Mid hides away in the Wind Crystal until he should become useful, which is during the scope of the anime. He sounds like he's on helium and is a lot smaller than he should be. He's also lost his glasses somew Being a ghost, he can't do much but give advice and banter angrily with Prettz.

<dt><a href="ff10characters.html#mika">Mika, Grand Maester</a> (10/X-2)</dt>
<dd>He's older than he looks - in fact, he's dead. Yet another Unsent. He's the head of the church of Yevon, and quite odd... he subscribes to the spiral of death involving the Final Summoning, but only because he truly believes that there's no way to actually defeat Sin. He's fanatically opposed to anyone trying to pierce the dead beliefs of the church, however, and it takes a huge overthrow (i.e. Yuna) to make him Send himself.
<br>[X-2] Mika shows up as an Unsent in the Via Infinito. Guess he wasn't really Sent after all.

<dd>The only Genome, besides Zidane and Kuja, who was given a soul by Garland. Unlike them, she has no fire in her voice or mood; the best she can do is free choice, but even in that department she is loyal to Garland and the leaders of Terra. Zidane shows her a whole other option, though, and she's initially overwhelmed by the possibilities.<p></dd>

He also likes to cast spells to help you out, depending on what color he's been painted. Apparently, moogles like to have their fur painted (and sheared).

His little boingy bobble has funky powers - it can protect from evil waves, for one thing, and can repair or enhance the Demon Gun. He can also fly around all over the place. His face and attire resemble a mini-Kaze in many ways. ^^; As you might expect, everything he says ends in "-kupo" (emphasis on "po"). He claims his given name is Kupo-Kupo. 8p<p>

<dd>A former member of the Crimson Squad and the current leader of the Youth League, where he's constantly fighting with his former buddy Baralai.

<dt><a href="ff8characters.html#norg">NORG</a> (8) </dt>
<dd>A fat and rich Shumi reminiscent of Jabba the Hutt, he was the one who financed SeeD. However, his cowardice caused him to want to do anything to appease the new sorceress, so he decided to give her Cid's head on a platter. Squall didn't like that idea too much.<p></dd>

<dt><a href="ff10characters.html#oaka">O'aka XXIII</a> (10/X-2)</dt>
<dd>A merchant with a Cockney accent and a backpack who trails around Yuna. At first it seems he's just out to make a quick buck (although if you donate to his cause his prices will be lowered), but it seems he's generally looking out for Yuna - although not enough to give her stuff for free. He's actually captured by the church and imprisoned for helping her, and his brother Wantz takes over the family business. Voiced by Dwight Shultz.
<br>[X-2] O'aka buys up Rin's travel agency near Macalania Temple, but when the temple falls into the lake, the shop goes belly-up. His Al Bhed creditors chase after him, but he's finally rescued by Yuna. He reopens his shop with her contributions, and finds Wantz come back home. After a bit of a fight, the two brothers open up shop together.

<dt>Odine, Dr. (8) </dt>
<dd>An extremely idiosyncratic personage, he has a scientific mind like a broken mirror - brilliant, but fractured. He tends to have absolutely no feelings for anything besides his research. His dress is ridiculous, looking sort of like a clown with that huge striped collar. He is a famous researcher of magical artifacts, and has taken a special interest in the sorceresses. He was the one who invented Junctioning and discovered GFs, and who extracted Ellone's powers into a machine. His lab is in Esthar City.<p></dd>

<dd>Orlandeau's adopted son is a magician and an astronomer. He's very brave and quite curious, the combination of which gets him wrongly dumped into the Zeltennia Castle dungeon by Delita for knowing too much. He later published the Durai Writings, which was soon confiscated by the Murond Glabados Church, but brought to light 400 years later by Alazlam, who narrates the game.

<dd>The ruler of Ivalice is a weak-willed man and completely unfit to rule. All the real decisions are carried out by his wife, Louveria. He's the son of King Denamunda II. After his second son died, he adopted Ovelia, his much younger sister, as his daughter. However, a third son, Orinus, was born to him from Louveria, which upset the entire political spectrum. After Ondoria's death, the War of the Lions was begun between Larg, Orinus's guardian, and Goltanna, a cousin of Louveria.

<dt><i><a href="ffucharacters.html#omega">Omega</a> (FFU)</i></dt>
<dd>Named after the ultimate optional boss fight in FF5 and 8, this boss is no longer optional! A devouring creature apparently made of antimatter... its mere existence destroys things. It was torn into pieces which were spread around the Inner World, but it's still alive! It can exist in crystal form when it's inert, or in rather more interesting forms, such as Kuria. The power source for Elizabeth, the subway, was a piece of Omega.<p>
<dt><a href="fftcharacters.html#orinas">Orinus Atkascha, Prince</a> (Tactics)/Orinas Atkascha, Prince (PSX) </dt>

<dt><i><a href="ffucharacters.html#oscar">Oscar</a> (FFU)</i></dt>
<dd>Apparently the most intelligent of the four Guardians. Oscar resembles a jester with no arms (he's quite bendy though). Actually, he does have arms, but they're usually absorbed into his body. His face is covered by a white mask. The only time I've seen him confront Kaze he used a complicated machine as his Monster-Of-The-Day. I've never seen him surprised by *anything*.<p></dd>

<dd>Isaaru's second guardian and brother, even though he can't be more than seven years old. Maybe he can guard him from really small fiends. Voiced by Candi Milo.
<br>[X-2] The leader of the Kinderguardians, a small-time sphere hunting group that sometimes blunders into situations way past their abilities, like the Via Infinito. Still, they pack a nice punch for such runts.

<dd>Paine is the third Gullwing - the strong, silent type, who doesn't like to talk (even though, as Yuna notes, she gets all the best lines). She was originally a sphere recorder with the Crimson Squad, but after they broke up she went to find her own path, which eventually led to the Gullwings. Yuna and Rikku soften her up a bit eventually. Paine is voiced by Gwendoline Yeo.<p></dd>

<dd>[VILLAIN] Ah yes, the evil of evils, head of the super-evil empire. At first it seems like he wants to rule the world, but no! Of course he'll eventually want to destroy it. He signed a pact with Satan to allow him to come back after he's killed.<p></dd>

<dt><i><a href="ffucharacters.html#pisto">Pist Shaz XI</a> (FFU)</i></dt>
<dd>Look up "slimy bastard" in the dictionary and you'll find his portrait. Quite literally. A freaky fish-man with a mouth in the back of his head, he rides around in a souped-up '50s car with a *pool* in the middle of it. Incorrigibly arrogant, boastful, and unfortunately more intelligent than the other three Deathlords living in Gaudium. He relies on speed and the analyzing of previously obtained data to actually plan out his fights other than just going in there and hitting people with monsters like Herba or Fungus. His first encounter with Kaze began with the keen observation that it takes him about a minute and a half to actually fire his gun. 8p Talk about breaking down the fourth wall! He's also got a showbiz streak in him, and is the mastermind behind the giant Ocean Puzzle. He has an incredibly annoying laugh ("shashasha!").<p>

His instant and only reaction to anything which bothers him is humorous aggression; aided by his constant companions - a samurai sword and spiked bombs which pull a strawberry before blowing up - it allows for some almost dangerous moments. He has a fixation for Linaly, of course without admitting it. However, his daredevil foolhardiness gets him and his friends out of several jams which normal people would blanch at even contemplating. He also rides a motorbike to help him get around. Voiced by Matt K. Miller.</dd></i><p>

<dt><a href="ff11characters.html#prishe">Prishe</a> (11)</dt>
<dd>Leader of the Tavnazian safehold.  Known as the "Abhorrent One", she is known for being brutally honest, but has unequalled intelligence.  Childhood friend of Ulmia, although she remains a child-like figure.  She explains that a darkness is plaguing the land, and is the central hero in Chains of Promathia.  She was discovered to be the Keeper of the Apocalypse, through which Promathia may be reborn.  When undergoing this rite, a freak accident prevented its completion, causing her immortality and embedded the dark magicite in her chest.  She wears an amulet that, unbeknownst to anyone, is one of the amulets the Zilart made the Kuluu wear to control them, given to her by the Cardinal. Her child-life figure is later revealed to be the result of her immortality, brought on by the Star of Tavnazia, which was later found to be the Eye of Altana, through which the Zilart King could know the thoughts of the Kuluu.  After Promathia was defeated, her mortality returned.<p>
<dt><a href="ff11characters.html#promathia">Promathia</a> (11)</dt>
<dd>Also known as the Lord of Chaos.  Another god, possibly on par with Altana, who bound in chains for some reason.  There are two possible origins - 1) At the time of Vana'diel's creation, He created the ark angels, which represent darkest attributes of the five races.  He also created beastmen to challenge the people of Vana'diel, to make sure they would never open the path to the gods.   He cursed the ancients (assumably the Zilart) and thusly, the people of Vana'diel, for attempting to open the gates of paradise.  This curse is the emptiness inside them, and their division amongst each other.  Ancient lore and several prominent figures in Chains of Promathia say the only way Vana'diel people can rid themselves of curse is to forget about the curse.  2) When the Emptiness, the absolute manifestation of death, threatened His life, Altana took the Mother Crystal and split it into five parts.  This changed the realm of the gods to Vana'diel.  He was chained in the city of Al'taieu.  To complete his reign, Promathia seeks his own resurrection and death, in which every sould in Vana'diel will return to Him when he dies.  He uses black magicite to kill members of Northland Expedition.  Through the efforts (some conscious and purposeful, some not) of those in the present day (during the Chains of Promathia storyline), He is resurrected.  The person most responsible for this is Nag'molada who wished the knowledge of the truth of creation.  Promathia absorbed his life essence and rose to finalize his dominion, when through the efforts of Prishe, Ulmia, Sehl'teus, and others, He was defeated.<p>

<dt><a href="ff10characters.html#rikku">Rikku</a> (10/X-2)</dt>
<dd>HISTORY:
<br>Rikku is the daughter of Cid, leader of the Al Bhed, which makes her first cousins with Yuna (or, as she insists on calling her, "Yunie"). She helps her dad out with his salvage operations and on one of them, searching for the legendary airship, she meets Tidus. She agrees with her father's insistance that the summoners' pilgrimages are bad, but when she tries to capture Yuna, she's thwarted by the five other guardians. After a short talk, though, she allows herself to accompany Yuna and accept her decision about her own life.
<br>PERSONALITY:
<br>Rikku is the token high-pitched-hyper-teenager type. She's very idealistic and a bit ditzy, but she can keep a cool head, except in the presence of lightning, which she has an irrational phobia about due to a childhood trauma. In battle she can't do much damage, but she's versatile otherwise, being able to dismantle robotic enemies, steal items, and use special items in battle. Rikku is voiced by Tara Strong.
<br>[X-2] Wearing even less than before (and sounding even dumber), Rikku now exists almost exclusively for comic relief. She's the one who got Yuna started on the whole sphere hunting thing, though. One thing of note is that she cured her fear of lightning by camping out in the Thunder Plains for a whole week.

<dd>A long-haired Al Bhed, who has set up Travel Agencies all over Spira in an effort to sell people things. He's always completely calm about everything and sees any crisis as an opportunity to make more money... although he never keeps any of it, to tell the truth: he uses it as part of a fund to rebuild the Al Bhed Home. He actively inquires into Tidus's bungling attempts to learn Al Bhed (or not so bungling, depending on how many Primers you've found). Voiced by Tom Kenny.
<br>[X-2] Branching into entertainment, Rin uses the coins found in the Bikanel Desert to start a new fad: Sphere Break. He's still keeping his hand in with the machina around Mi'ihen Highroad, though, and you might just find out that he's sabotaging them himself due to the reports of Mako - err... "planet energy" that could replace machina as the mode du jour of technology.

<dt>Semih Lafihna (11)</dt>
<dd>Mithra head of the Star Sybil's guards, she is considered the right hand of the Star Sybil.  She captured Ajido-Marujido after his secret meeting with Yagudo.  Later discovered the nature of Karaha-Baruha's current state, that part of his life force was in Joker, but a larger part was in Fenrir, and that the mysterious figure shown to Ajido-Marujido was the Fenrir/Karuha-Baruha combination.  <p>
<dt><a href="ff7characters.html#sephiroth">Sephiroth</a> (7) </dt>
<dd>[VILLAIN] The ultra-powerful genealogical son of Jenova (biological son of Hojo and Lucrecia), this guy has some major problems. His "mother" is a planet-devouring entity, his true father is a medical psychopath, and he's got enough firepower to down a few solar systems. Guess what happens when he meets up with our heroes? It's a shame, really - if he'd never met his real mother, he might have been quite a nice guy.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff7characters.html#seto">Seto</a> (7) </dt>
<dd>Red XIII's father and defender of Cosmo Canyon from the Gi tribe. He took their poison arrows and turned to stone, but still watches over the canyon. He let everyone believe he was a coward, but in truth he was the real hero.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff6characters.html#setzer">Setzer Gabbiani</a> (6) </dt>
<dd>[HERO] A high-flying gambler who's always in for a challenge, Setzer ends up helping the Returners almost by default. He's very cool and calm, but hides a tragic past: the only other airship in the world was owned by his girlfriend Daryl, who tried going too close to the sun and crashed. He's been brooding and vague ever since, and drowns his woes in gambling (he has an entire casino aboard his airship).<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff10characters.html#seymour">Seymour Guado, Maester</a> (10/X-2)</dt>
<dd>[VILLAIN] In my opinion, the most annoyingly superfluous person in any RPG. He became the maester of the Guado by killing his father, Lord Jyscal, and amazingly, no one seems to care. (At least at first... his servant Tromell eventually regrets his glossing over of the fact.) Born the son of a Guado and a human, the resulting childhood problems had his mother turn herself into a fayth and therefore an Aeon (named Anima) in order to give him more power. (Maybe try to spend more time with him instead of killing yourself, eh?) Seymour likes the power, though, and eventually his demented mind decides that everybody in Spira is suffering too much, so let's just kill 'em all! He decides to become Sin. Oof. Yuna and co. actually kill him in their first fight, but Seymour doesn't let himself be Sent. He actually tries to marry Yuna several times (gross!) and somehow manages to get generic RPG-Villain Big Bad Bodies during subsequent battles until he's finally Sent inside Sin. Seymour is voiced by Alex Fernandez.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff6characters.html#shadow">Shadow</a> (6) </dt>
<dd>[HERO] A mysterious assassin who nevertheless seems to like helping out the Returners, provided they have enough cash. His semi-rabid dog Interceptor is always with him, but not too many people can get close to the mutt... besides Relm, who thinks he's a cute puppy. Evidence points to Shadow, a.k.a. Clyde, being Relm's father...<p></dd>
<dt>Shadow Lord (11)</dt>
<dd>The lord of the beastmen.  From an obsidian throne in Xarcabard, he gathered the alliance of most of the beastmen races and attacked the three nations.  This began the Crystal War.  He was defeated by the shadow knight, Zeid, although Volker took the credit.  Through a conspiracy between the beastmen and the Archduke of Jeuno, the Shadow Lord was reborn.  After his second defeat by Zeid, the Shadow Lord was revealed to be Raogrimm.  It was found that he gave his soul to the dark forces of Vana'diel if he could have revenge for Cornelia.  Raogrimm found the Zilart princes in Delkfutt Tower and granted his wish, changing him unwillingly into the Shadow Lord.  Angry at being used by Kam'lanaut, he sacrificed himself to save his friend Zeid as he and the other heroes fled the castle.  After the fight, he found himself in Dynamis, the dream world, where he finds the other members of the Northland expedition.  They pledge to stay with him and he is finally reunited with Cornelia.  However, Raogrimm will not be free of Shadow Lord's control until Vana'diel is united and the hatred is gone.<p>
<dt>Shantotto, Professor (11)</dt>
<dd>Wacky professor of the Tarutaru.  She is known for his role in the Ajido-Marujido situation and helped Apururu clear her brother's name.  Known for making fun of people, having an outrageous laughter and attitude.  Some consider her a "super" mage, but she has a tendency not to be able to control her own magic.  Many people have different reactions to her.   <p>
<dt><a href="fftacharacters.html#shara">Shara</a>
<dd>A viera whose clan befriends Ritz in Ivalice. Although she seems sophistocated and suave, she's actually a bit of a baby when it comes to bugs. After Marche saves her from some antlion larva (after the game's over), she joins his clan.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff10characters.html#shelinda">Shelinda</a> (10/X-2)</dt>
<dd>A squeaky-voiced cleric of the Yevonites. She also follows around Tidus and Yuna, affirming her undying faith for Yevon. Eventually even she is shaken, though. She ends up being the captain of the guards in Bevelle due to nobody else wanting to do it. Voiced by Sherry Lynn.
<br>[X-2] Still working for anybody who orders her around, Shelinda is now a reporter for the (apparently) only sphere station on Spira, which is centered around Luca.
<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff7characters.html#shera">Shera</a> (7)</dt>
<dd>Cid's faithful helper tried a little too hard and earned his neverending wrath for making him destroy his dream of space travel to save her life. After that, she lives to serve him; taking all the verbal abuse he dishes out in an effort to atone for her botch-up. She eventually proves her self-worth, however, when her fears for the launch prove correct after all.<p></dd>
<dt>Shikaree Z (11)</dt>
<dd>Mithra who attacks Prishe.  Ally of Cardinal Mildaurion.  She fights alongside the heroes of Chains of Promathia, then retires from the Sinhunters.<p>
<dt><a href="ff7characters.html#shinpres">Shinra, President</a> (7) </dt>
<dd>President Shinra's a real SOB. He basically rules Midgar through his money and manipulation of the news; he's sucking the life energy out of the planet; and he wants all the good guys dead. He gets his, though - a nice big sword stuck in him ten hours into the game. His son Rufus takes over, and he's not much better.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff10characters.html#shinra">Shinra</a> (X-2)</dt>
<dd>The genius Al Bhed inventor who tags around with the Gullwings, Shinra is nevertheless "just a kid". He can get on your nerves, though, especially when he beats you senseless in Sphere Break. It's just conjecture whether he's related to the Shinra of FF7, but a scene near the end of the game does seem to confirm that. Voiced by Pamela Adlon.<p></dd>
<dt><i><a href="ffucharacters.html#cloud">Shroi Kumo</a> (FFU)</i></dt>
<dd>Kaze's epic archenemy, the Demon Swordsman... although he seems to have a reluctance to actually fight Kaze, mainly, I think, because he knows they're really on the same side. He's also very reticent, but I think it's for different reasons... Kaze really just doesn't care about people, but Shroi Kumo seems just to be too burdened to say anything. I think he's a basically good man, but he works for Earl Tyrant because he's been overpowered... and possibly because he doesn't have anything else to live for, his world having been eaten by Chaos. His attacks all look similar: he uses bottles of mist to summon a white dragon, using names of music (etude, quartet, symphony, etc.). The shade of his brother Madoushi ends up being killed by him, and he begins to be disillusioned with Earl Tyrant, even after being made a Deathlord of Gaudium. He starts to surreptitiously help the Comodin and Ai/Yu/Lisa and eventually comes out in the open, sacrificing himself to defeat Earl Tyrant.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff10characters.html#shuyin">Shuyin</a> (X-2)</dt>
<dd>The villain of the piece. Shuyin was a citizen of Bevelle, who fell in love with Lenne of Zanarkand during the war a thousand years ago. He tried to use Vegnagun to save Lenne from his own side, but both he and her were shot dead before he could reach it. However, his anger and hate were so strong that they lived on (in a cave below the Mushroom Rock Road), and he drove anyone who entered mad. However, the Crimson Squad survived his attack; he responded by "possessing" Nooj. In the ensuing years he manipulated his way up until he found his way into Baralai, and through him, into the Farplane where Vegnagun lay in wait. However, Yuna, channeling Lenne through her dressphere, confronted him and finally got him and Lenne to rest.
<br>Shuyin is identical to Tidus (and is voiced by the same actor, James Arnold Taylor). It's just conjecture, but I believe Tidus was a "dream" of someone who was once a real person in Zanarkand. Perhaps the "dream" was a bit nicer than the reality, which is that Shuyin, who Tidus was based on, was not a very nice man at all.<p></dd>
<dt><i><a href="fftswcharacters.html#sid">Sid, Professor</a> (TSW)
</i></dt><dd>The man who made bio-etheric energy possible, and then made it his goal in life, Sid is a gentle man dedicated to getting rid of the Phantoms with the minimal possible damage to the Earth itself. He has a great fondness for his assistant Aki, and a respect for the pain she goes through. He is deeply insightful into many things in life, and is seldom wrong. When he is, though, he admits it genially without a shred of ego.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff6characters.html#siegfried">Siegfried</a> (6) </dt>
<dd>The pompous swordsman who thinks he's all that, he's really nothing more than a thief who lets other people do the work. However, once you meet him in the Coliseum, he's apparently honed his skills to perfection. According to him, the one who dogged you until then was an impostor.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="fftcharacters.html#simon">Simon Penn-Lachish</a> (Tactics), Simon Pen Rakshu (PSX)</dt>
<dd>The head of Orbonne Monastery used to be a Pagan Examiner for the Glabados Church, but one incident had him resign from that job. He secretly researched the Germonik Scriptures; the Knights Templar killed him for that.
<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff10characters.html#sin">Sin</a> (10/X-2)</dt>
<dd>On the one hand, Sin is a giant water-bound demon who attacks everything and anything, and whose toxin causes weakness and amnesia. On a second hand, Sin is the living armor of Yu Yevon, made from the Final Aeon of a summoner. On the third hand, Sin is the fayth who became the Final Aeon... in this case, Jecht. His multiple personalities make him a very hard thing to gauge. Apparently he fights mindlessly, which is probably all the more painful for Jecht who has to watch it all.<p></dd>
<dt>Smilebringer (11)</dt>

<dt>Sol Racht (CC)</dt>
<dd>A brave and noble Lilty warrior who leads the caravan from Alfitaria. While he's a nice enough guy, he seems pretty prejudiced that only Lilties can handle themselves in a battle, and will give the party healing items whenever there aren't any Lilties around. His primary quest is to find and subdue the Black Knight, though his team finds time to collect Myrrh, too. <p></dd>
<dt><i><a href="ffucharacters.html#somosan">Somosan</a> (FFU)</i></dt>
<dd>A giant mermaid... her voice first sounds like she's almost crying, but she gets nastier. 8p She's one of the challenges inside the Ocean Puzzle; her riddles are designed to have no answer and confuse the players, sinking them closer into Chaos... but Lisa, with Kaze's help, finally pierces her illusion.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ffmqcharacters.html#spencer">Spencer</a> (MQ) </dt>
<dd>An eccentric old man and Phoebe's grandfather. He lives alone in a waterway beneath her house. He sometimes goes out adventuring on a whim.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff8characters.html#squall">Squall Leonhart</a> (8) </dt>
<dd>[HERO] The reclusive, antisocial hero of 8. Squall sports brown hair and a facial scar from a tussle with Seifer. An orphan, we later find out that he attended the Kramer orphanage. His parents, it is vaguely alluded to, are Laguna and Raine, which would make Ellone his adopted sister. (He called her "Sis" in the orphanage either way). During his escapades as a SeeD, he slowly falls for his first employer, Rinoa. His weapon of choice is a gunblade - not the most realistic of weapons, but definitely one of the coolest. He was supposedly called Squall because he was supposed to remind you of a passing storm, something that doesn't get very close up. "Leonhart" is supposedly reused from Leon, one of the heros from 2, although it's also a reference to his symbol, Griever.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="fftcharacters.html#stajora">St. Ajora Glabados</a> (Tactics) </dt>
<dd>A Jesus-like character who lived 1200 years before the game takes place. He lived in Bervenia Free City, in Lesalia; raised in Milodos. The then-church, Fara, began to feel some antipathy towards him (which was returned) when he began to prophesize about a new kingdom taking hold. He was executed by the Holy Empire of Yudora at the Golgollada Gallows, but soon afterwards, the Fara Church capital was submerged in the sea by a seemingly natural phenomenon and disappeared. Many people took this to be a miracle and the Glabados Church was formed. (The true Ajora was a spy who seeded rebellion; the Yudora Empire executed him partly for those crimes.) St. Ajora never really died; he struck a pact with the Zodiac Braves allowing him to come back to life if the Holy Stones were brought to Murond Death City. When that finally happens, he turns into the Lucavi, Ultima.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff9characters.html#steiner">Steiner, Adelbert</a> (9)</dt>
<dd>[HERO] Dagger's unbelievably loyal knight (head of the Knights of Pluto), he sticks by her side through thick and thin. However, his idea of what's good for her doesn't always agree with her idea. Zidane's good-natured intervention drives him crazy, and it takes him an inordinate amount of time to admit that Zidane's more than just a thief and a criminal. As some of his beliefs come crashing down during the story, his resolve begins to weaken. A side point of that is his hidden and growing feelings for Beatrix.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff5characters.html#stella">Stella</a> (5) </dt>
<dd>Drogan's wife and Bartz'z mother, she endured her husband's journeys as much as she could. She fell ill when Bartz was young and died soon after; Drogan lost the will to live and followed her in the same year.<p></dd>

<dt>Stiltzkin (CC)</dt>
<dd>A moogle who travels the world in search of the answers behind the miasma... and his own existance. Stiltzkin wonders, "If moogles can remain unaffected by the miasma like monsters, then does that mean that moogles are monsters?" His search takes him through the whole world and he ends up in Mag Mell, investigating the strange occurrences there. He's also a good teacher for battle, and the party can make use of his wisdom. Stiltzkin is almost certainly a crossover character, with the same name, clothing, design, and characteristics as the Stiltzkin that appears in Final Fantasy IX.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff6characters.html#strago">Strago Magus</a> (6), Stragus (6j) </dt>
<dd>[HERO] A codgy old sorceror who lives in a town of magicians and tries to hide his powers from the world.

<dd>[HERO] An old Sage who knows every magic there is to know... besides the ultimate Black Magic, Meteor. He's a hotheaded geezer who seldom thinks before rushing into things. His daughter Anna runs off with Edward, causing Tellah to angrily search after her. Finding out she was killed by Golbez sends him on a rage-filled quest to find Meteor and use it against him, even if it kills Tellah in the doing.<p></dd>
<dt>Tenzen (11)</dt>
<dd>A samurai from an unknown empire who comes to Vana'diel to do what he can to stop the emptiness and Promathia.  He discovers his sword is the Phoenix flame, which shakes to warn of danger.  He receives a vision of the fight between the Zilart and the avatars.  Near the end he mistakenly fights against those seeking to destroy Promathia, thinking it will end the world.  After Promathia is defeated, he apologizes for his actions and returns to his empire.  <p>

Her youth and memory loss mean that she has a lot of harsh lessons to learn along the way.<p></dd>

<dt><a href="ff10characters.html#tidus">Tidus</a> (10/X-2)</dt>
<dd>[HERO] The son of Jecht (whom he abhors and always tries to surpass, in blitzball and everything else), Tidus is thrust from the dreamworld Zanarkand into Spira when Sin visits it. About 98% of the game is seen from Tidus's point of view; in fact, he narrates his own thoughts frequently as well. Tidus is an optimistic, good-natured young man with high ideals, but he's quite human and a bit of a crybaby, as it appears. Although his main goal is to return to Zanarkand, he soon finds that he cares deeply for his new friends, especially Yuna. The news that Yuna won't survive her pilgrimage hits him particularly hard. During most of the game Tidus feels like an outsider, not knowing anything about his surroundings, but eventually he gains leadership qualities and becomes a real get-goer. As for what happens to him once the fayth stop their dream... it's left completely up to conjecture. Tidus is voiced by James Arnold Taylor; young Tidus (flashbacks) is voiced by Cree Summer.
<br>[X-2] Tidus hangs out in the Farplane. If you get the Good ending, the fayths somehow manage to bring him back from the "sort of dead" to meet Yuna in the waters near Besaid. And they live happily ever after.

<dt>Tobli (X-2)</dt>
<dd>This hyperactive midget entertainment manager has high aspirations for putting on his shows (and generally manages to meet them). He relies on a Spira-wide network of Hypello to advertise his stuff, and oddly enough, it works. Obviously Yuna's appeal helps a great deal to sell his venues. Voiced by Rob Paulsen.<p></dd>

<dt>Trema (X-2)</dt>
<dd>The founder of New Yevon, he aims to destroy people's pasts so they would look to the future. He's also the hardest enemy in the game, shuttered away in the bottom floor of the Via Infinito with all the other insane bosses. Trema is voiced by David Rasner (same as Brother).<p></dd>
<dt>Trion, Prince (11)</dt>
<dd>San'dorian prince, son of King Destin.  He is involved in the side quest for red mage artifact armor, and orders you to go to crawlers nest.  As a ruler, he is seen as overly aggressive, and not a good leader.  <p>

<dt><a href="ff10characters.html#tromell">Tromell Guado</a> (10/X-2)</dt>
<dd>The sycophantic retainer of Seymour, he follows everything Seymour does blindly - and not so blindly, destroying evidence of Seymour's patricide. He's a bit infuriating in his firm belief that Tidus is the Bad Guy, but eventually he regrets his deeds nonetheless. In fact, towards the end of the game he spends his entire time in the Farplane, apologizing. Voiced by Corey Burton.
<br>[X-2] Tromell and the other Guado hide out in Macalania Forest, depressed and saddened by their deeds. However, the other mystical Macalania residents save him with their music, and he accepts the responsibility of leading the Guado, returning them to Guadosalam and restoring relations with the Ronso.

<dd>The head of the Turks is super-cool; he's the only guy you never fight.

Sephiroth, of course. What a question.<p></dd>
<dt>Tukuku (11)</dt>
<dd>The star sybil at dawn of the age of magic.  She was blessed with powerful magic at a young age.  When she was chosen to be the next Star Sybil, no one attended her rite of ascension.  The magic power the Tarutaru had just gained plunged them into conflicts amongst each other.  Tukuku appeared at a battle site and cast a powerful spell, making both sides pay attention.  After three days and nights of negotiations, she united her people under the Federation of Windurst.  Unfortunately, she died shortly after.<p>
<dt><a href="ff5characters.html#tycoon">Tycoon, Alexander Highwind</a> (5) </dt>
<dd>The king of Tycoon had to choose between killing the last living Dragon and letting his life die; he chose the sorry death of his wife, and his daughter Reina had a very hard time forgiving him.

King Tycoon has a very strange relationship with Bartz and company; it's unclear whether he's originally from the Second World, or just a resident of the First World with great magical power.<p></dd>

<dt>Ulrich (11)</dt>
<dd>An elite hume musketeer who was sent on a mission to explore the Northlands.  The female monk Cornelia was sent with.  Ulrich was angered over the hume woman's affection for a Galka named Raogrimm and not himself.  Once in the north, he split the party, taking only Raogrimm with him, plotting to kill him.  Neither of them noticed Cornelia follow them.  Ulrich engaged Raogrimm in combat, and when Ulrich thrust the final blow, Cornelia jumped in front, taking the blade into herself instead.  Ulrich walked away with Raogrimm mourning over her.  He later returned to the rest of the party and explained Raogrimm and Cornelia fell off a cliff and were killed.  He was later found mysteriously murdered, as were all other members of the Northland expedition.  <p>

<dd>A large yeti whose vocabulary falls somewhere in the double digits, he's very big, very strong, and very slow. Apparently his race has an inbred subservience to moogles. Go figure.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff1characters.html#underhill">Underhill</a> (1) </dt>
<dd>The caravan master who bottles fairies for a living and sells them for ridiculous prices.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff1characters.html#unne">Unne, Dr.</a> (1) </dt>
<dd>A professor who's studying Leifinish.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff3characters.html#unne">Unne</a> (3) </dt>
<dd>One of the three students of Archmage Noah, she controls the Dream World. Unfortunately, that means she's asleep, and only Noah's Lute can wake her. She has great powers for good, like Dorga, and help the Heroes out even after she dies. She has a parrot who talks.<p></dd>
<dt><i><a href="ffacharacters.html#valkas">Valkas</a> (Anime)
<dd>[HERO] A bumbling general of the Tycoon air force, Valkas leads the Iron Wing airship. His tendency to get worked up about absolutely everything makes for some very awkward moments, especially when he suddenly finds himself in love with Rouge, who happens to be his captor at the time. Fairly agressive (made worse by the fact that he's almost a giant), he's nevertheless fiercely loyal to Queen Reina and eventually works for the greater good. He wears what looks like jeweler's lenses done in black and his uniform is way too tight. Voiced by John DeMita.</dd></i><p>
<dt>Valowa, King (Tactics)
<dd>The king of Ordalia who fought the Fifty Year War with Ivalice. He took over after his father, King Diwanu, died. His successor was Prince Lanard.<p>
<dt><a href="ff4characters.html#valvalicia">Valvalis</a> (4)</dt>
<dd>The Emperor/Fiend of Wind, she lives in her floating tower (which looks a lot like the Tower of Babel). She's the one who keeps Rosa captive during the game. Her name comes from Dante's Inferno, an ancient work.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff6characters.html#vargas">Vargas</a> (6) </dt>
<dd>Duncan's son and Mr. Jealousy. He thought Sabin was Duncan's intended successor, and so he makes the biggest (and last) mistake of his life in challenging Sabin to a death duel.<p></dd>

<dd>The other sister of Aldo.  She has the unique abilty to communicate with animals and beastmen, especially goblins.  In Rise of the Zilart, she disappeared.  Later, we find her being used by Eald'narche in activating the Delkfutt reactor.  After the events of Rise of the Zilart, she receives a vision that Lion may be alive.<p>

<dt>Vidina (X-2)</dt>
<dd>Wakka's and Lulu's baby son, born near the end of the game.<p></dd>
<dt>Vijortal Caphieux (11)</dt>
<dd>A royal knight loyal to King Raigegue and vehemently anti-bastok.  Raigegue told him to join the temple knights to uncover his brother's plot, then assassinate him.  However, Caphieux turned against his king and saved Fellenant, but was mortally wounded in the process.<p>
<dt><a href="ff7characters.html#vincent">Vincent Valentine</a> (7) </dt>
<dd>[HERO] A former Turk, he fell in love with Lucrecia while working with Dr. Gast and Hojo. He kept his feelings to himself, seeing her feelings for Hojo instead of him. However, when Hojo took her baby for the Jenova experiment, Vincent confronted Hojo and lost; his punishment was to be transformed into an undead. One of his hands is metallic gold; he wears a red cape and can transform into other monsters during battle. He uses a shotgun to attack normally. Perhaps because of his predicament, he's very quiet and only tags along to get rid of Sephiroth.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff9characters.html#vivi">Vivi Ornitier</a> (9), VIVI (9j)</dt>
<dd>[HERO] One of Kuja's Black Mages, who "malfunctioned" and began to think for himself. He was adopted by Quan, a Qu living near Treno, and fell in with Zidane completely by accident. He's still a child, both in size and outlook, and the constant doubts and soul-searching he entertains seem somehow out-of-place. His plight never fails to touch anyone, though, even the hard-knocking Zidane. His black magic can be devastating in battle.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff11characters.html#volker">Volker</a> (11)</dt>
<dd>Nephew of Ulrich, leader of the Mythril Musketeers.  He led the final attack on Xarcabard in the airship "First Ship" and stormed the Castle Zvahl with five heroes of the five races.  He is known to the people as the hero that defeated the Shadow Lord.  However, Zeid struck the final blow, and Volker took the credit.  Later, he was dispatched to watch over the situation in Bastok concerning the return of the Talekeeper.  When he received a letter from Zeid revealing the shameful truth about Ulrich and Cornelia, he returned to the castle and fought Zeid to a standstill.  They parted ways and he returned to Bastok to find no ill will beared towards him.  <p>
<dt>Vukki-Chebukku (11)</dt>
<dd>Father of chebukku triplets.<p>
<dt><a href="ff10characters.html#wakka">Wakka</a> (10/X-2)</dt>
<dd>HISTORY:
<br>Yuna's childhood friend, Wakka resolved to become a guardian full-time after the death of his brother Chappu. When he meets Tidus, he's astounded by his similarity to Chappu and approves of Yuna's decision to enlist him as another guardian. Formerly the captain of the Besaid Aurochs, his blitzball got a bit rusty after Chappu died and he found himself unable to concentrate; he's still quite a good player, though. A fierce believer in Yevon's teachings, he's incredulous as he slowly perceives the church's hypocrisy.
<br>PERSONALITY:
<br>Wakka is laid-back and cool; a neat Hawaiian accent accompanies his statements. He's also devout, though, which sometimes sounds a bit weird. He has a good sense of humor and sometimes likes to horse around. In battle, Wakka's blitzball throws are great against flying enemies, and he can cause status problems as well. Wakka is voiced by John DiMaggio (same as Kimahri).
<br>[X-2] Rikku claims he's pudgier, but he looks exactly the same. Oh well. Having married Lulu, Wakka is now going nuts worried about what he needs to do to be a father. At one point he searches for a sphere of his parents, whom he never met, to find out what parenting is all about; but he fails. Beclem, a war buddy of Chappu, is disappointed in Wakka's wimpiness and knocks heads with him a few times. In the end, Beclem gives Wakka a sphere of Chappu, who asks why he couldn't just be a brother instead of a surrogate father. Wakka realizes that he can't always make up molds for him to fit into, and decides to go along with his gut feeling (excuse the pun). 
<p></dd>
<dt>Wantz (10/X-2)</dt>
<dd>O'aka's similarly Cockneyed brother takes over the business when O'aka is unceremoniously imprisoned for helping Yuna. Originally he was the FFX equivalent of a photographer, grabbing sphere shots of the party at inopportune times; but when duty calls, he answers. Voiced by Tom Kenny.
<br>[X-2] After being effectively booted out of the family business by O'aka, he shows up two years later at the Macalania branch and, after some arguing, helps with the new shop.
<p></dd>
<dt>War Cloud (11)</dt>
<dd>A.K.A. Zeid, a friend and aid to Raogrimm. <p>
<dt><a href="ff8characters.html#ward">Ward Zabac</a> (8) </dt>
<dd>[HERO] The third member of Laguna's posse, Ward walks heavily and speaks very little - in fact, nothing at all, after he loses his voice in a battle with Esthar soldiers. However, you can always tell what he's thinking by the expression on his face. He can still do heavy damage with his anchor-like spear, though.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff8characters.html#watzon">Watts</a> (8) </dt>
<dd>Kind of a cheesy gopher working for Rinoa, his job is gathering information and getting chased by people.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff6characters.html#wedbig">Wedge</a> (6) </dt>
<dd>Another generic soldier for the Empire who gets wasted by Tritoch.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff7characters.html#wedge">Wedge</a> (7) </dt>
<dd>The roundish third member of AVALANCHE, he's the fireworks/explosives specialist. He's also the most vulnerable-sounding of the bunch.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff8characters.html#wedge">Wedge</a> (8) </dt>
<dd>Private Wedge of Galbadia at your service. A loserly little dude who always follows instructions and is just there for comic relief.<p></dd>
<dt>Werei (11)</dt>
<dd>A friend of Gumbah, who was apparently lost on his Journey of Rebirth.  He wrote a letter telling Gumbah that he was the new Talekeeper.  He succeeded in being reborn, but had no memories of his friend.  <p>
<dt><a href="fftcharacters.html#wiegraf">Wiegraf Folles</a> (Tactics) </dt>
<dd>The former leader of the Knights of Death and current leader of the Corpse Brigade. He became a Templar during the War of the Lions and eventually communed with Belias, a Lucavi demon. He was killed by Ramza in Riovanes Castle.
<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff11characters.html#wolfgang">Wolfgang</a> (11)</dt>
<dd>Hume general of the Duchy Army.  He is sent to investigate the shattering of crystals at the crags.  Also dispatched to attack Bahamut's wyrms.  Childhood friend of Dr. Monberaux.   <p>
<dt>Construct 7 (Tactics), Worker 7-new (PSX)</dt>
<dd>An identical clone to Construct 8, Construct 7-new has been guarding the Nelveska Temple (which used to be some sort of research center) even though all the residents have long been deceased. Once Ramza manages to destroy it, he receives the Cancer Stone which made it run.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="fftcharacters.html#construct8">Construct 8</a> (Tactics), Worker 8 (PSX)</dt>
<dd>[HERO] An Steel Giant long ago disused, Besrudio found it in the Goug mines. It requires the Cancer Holy Stone to operate, and once Ramza puts it in, it joins Ramza's party. (It claims that Ramza is its master.)<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff5characters.html#exdeath">X-death</a> (5)</dt>
<dd>[VILLAIN] Originally a malevolent tree born from the Great Forest of Moore, X-death lives to nullify. His ultimate scheme is to suck everything in the world into a power called the "Void" (or "Mu") and then disappear himself. Why? Who the hell knows? He makes a cool villain, though. His sidekick (at least until he exiles him) is Gilgamesh.<p></dd>
<dt>Xu (8) </dt>
<dd>Xu's Quistis's friend and another SeeD instructor. She's also great at the Triple Triad card game. She's always there for ya in a crisis. (If we're following the Chinese pronunciation, it should be pronounced "shoe".)<p></dd>
<dt>Yaibal (X-2)</dt>
<dd>A naive and principled member of the Youth League, who tends to get overexcited. Voiced by Scott Menville.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff4characters.html#yang">Yang</a> (4) </dt>
<dd>[HERO] The head Monk at Fabul, Yang is a pure-hearted and valiant warrior. His loving wife is quite patient as he gallivants around saving the world. He is attacked by Leviathan at one point; the next Cecil sees of him, he's under Golbez's control. He snaps out of it quickly. After a very brave and very stupid move which destroys the Tower of Babel, Yang is taken by the Sylphs to recover.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff10characters.html#yenke">Yenke Ronso</a> (10)</dt>
<dd>One of Kimahri's stupid taunters; he basically hangs around Biran and jeers at Kimahri. He's bigger but slower than his counterpart.<p></dd>
<dt>Yomi (11)</dt>
<dd>Dead wife of Ensetsu.<p>
<dt>Yoran-Oran (11)</dt>
<dd>A Tarutaru villager.  The Chebukki triplets thought he was their father, but this was disproved.  He has been to Tavnazia once to examine an artifact.  <p>
<dt><a href="ff7characters.html#yuffie">Yuffie Kisaragi</a> (7) </dt>
<dd>[HERO] Although born in the traditional Japanese-type town of Wutai, Yuffie's a twerpy, Clueless kind of kid who just happens to be a ninja. She has a spot of kleptomania when it comes to materia, and she'll steal even from friends. She's very disappointed in her father Godo's way of running Wutai; that's why she ran away. Her Pinwheels are pretty deadly in battle; she's stronger than she looks!<p></dd>
<dt><i><a href="ffucharacters.html#yu">Yu Hayakawa</a> (FFU)</i></dt>
<dd>Ai's more thoughtful twin brother, the kind of person who likes little animals. In fact, he befriends a rather hyperactive chocobo early on (whom he names Chobi), and wears one of its feathers, upon which time he realizes he can read Chobi's thoughts a bit. He tends to be a bit less annoying than his "big sister", and sometimes gets discouraged during their quest to find their parents.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff10characters.html#yuyevon">Yu Yevon</a> (10/X-2)</dt>
<dd>The very first summoner. Yevon had the ability to actually inhabit the Aeons he summoned, and he transformed a particularly powerful one into Sin, a living armor doubling as a demon of terrible destruction. Bevelle's armies were blown away by Sin, though Sin's creation also caused the destruction of Zanarkand. The people of Zanarkand were turned into fayths, who kept Zanarkand alive through their dream. Yevon's daughter Yunalesca began the "spiral of death" with the first Final Summoning. Spira was so scared of Yevon that they constructed an entire church dedicated to his "teachings", which include laws against machina. Yevon remains in Sin throughout the spiral of death, continually summoning the dream of the fayth: Zanarkand.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff10characters.html#yuna">Yuna</a> (10/X-2)</dt>
<dd>HISTORY:
<br>The daughter of High Summoner Braska and an Al Bhed (the sister of Cid) (which accounts for her having one green eye and one blue), Yuna was brought up in Besaid Island. She's childhood friends with Lulu, Wakka, and Chappu (at least until Chappu was killed). She's always had the good of Spira in mind, and resolved to become a Summoner as soon as she could, not caring about the consequences. She's priveleged with no less than six guardians before her pilgrimage is up. After Sin is defeated, she becomes something of an ad hoc leader in Spira.
<br>PERSONALITY:
<br>As Auron puts it, Yuna's "serious to a fault"; though she does laugh and cavort at times, you always get the feeling she's just doing it as a diversion from her pilgrimage, which is never far from her mind. She's quite strong-willed, though, and once she decides to do something, no matter what the consequences, it gets done. She's rather private as well, and doesn't always tell her friends everything on her mind. In battle, she's the sole summoner and acts as a White Mage as well. Yuna is voiced by Hedy Burress.
<br>[X-2] Yuna's undergone a massive personality change, probably due to the newfound lack of purpose in her life. She's now a carefree sphere hunter, a member (and de facto leader, notwithstanding Brother's protests) of the Gullwings. Her wardrobe funds seem to have been depleted, though. She now packs two guns and kicks ass. She runs around Spira searching for Tidus, who she thinks she saw in an ancient sphere. Eventually, after finding out about Vegnagun, and hearing about the fiend attacks around Spira, she abandons her sphere hunting for a line of work closer to her heart - helping out people who need it. Still kicking ass along the way, though.
<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff10characters.html#yunalesca">Yunalesca</a> (10/X-2)</dt>
<dd>The daughter of Yu Yevon was the first Summoner. Her husband Zaon was the first Final Aeon, as well... however, Yunalesca never died. She stayed on in the destroyed Zanarkand to complete the rite of the Final Summoning for all the other Summoners that came after. She's very powerful, and only Yuna (who was named after her) and her entire retinue of guardians was able to finally do Yunalesca in. Voiced by Julia Fletcher.
<br>[X-2] Yunalesca appears as an Unsent in Via Infinito.
<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff6characters.html#yura">Yura</a> (6) </dt>
<dd>He used to be the gatekeeper in Esperville; after Terra called the Espers out, he led the remnants to a magical place near Thamasa. He was willing to come to peace terms with humans, but Kefka once again strikes and Yura becomes nothing more than Magicite.<p></dd>
<dt>Yve'Noile (11)</dt>
<dd>Gatekeeper of the dawn maidens.  She conspired with Graviton to bring about the destruction of the Zilart.  Her "afterlife" allows her to exist immortally, and she continues to assist/interfere with important events.  She helped Zeid find the Curelean crystal, the event which starts the Chains of Promathia storyline, and shows herself to Eald'narche in his final hours, telling him that his efforts are futile.<p>
<dt><a href="ff7characters.html#zack">Zack</a> (7) </dt>
<dd>Cloud's alterego of a sort. He was the real SOLDIER; Cloud just THOUGHT he was one. A confused Cloud took over his job, so to speak, and his persona, after Zack was killed by Shinra soldiers. His parents live in Gongaga.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff11characters.html#zadha">Za'Dha Adamantking</a> (11)</dt>
<dd>King of the Quadav.  He rests in the inner part of Beadeaux, the Qulun Dome.  He is a white mage and can use "benediction" to recover all his HP.<p>
<dt><a href="fftcharacters.html#zalbaag">Zalbaag Beoulve</a> (Tactics), Zalbag Beoulve (PSX)</dt>
<dd>A Holy Knight of Eagrose, Zalbaag is Barbaneth' second son. A pure-hearted warrior, he leads the Order of the Northern Sky. Even when faced with the horrific treachery of his brother Dycedarg(which he naively refuses to believe until confronted with concrete evidence), he upholds truth and goodness.
<p></dd>
<dt><a href="fftcharacters.html#zalmo">Zalmour Lucianada</a> (Tactics), Zalmo Rusnada (PSX)</dt>
<dd>A Pagan Examiner of the Church, whose job it is to hunt out heretics. He chases after Ramza for a while. He was defeated at Zeltennia Castle.
<p></dd>
<dt>Zanar (10)</dt>
<dd>The announcer in Zanarkand way back at the start of the game; a huge Jecht fan.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff3characters.html#zande">Zande</a> (3) </dt>
<dd>[VILLAIN] Archmage Noah's third student was given life as a human, but it wasn't enough. Using his powers for evil, he summoned the Cloud of Darkness to give him power, but the plan naturally backfired. Zande took up residence at the top of the Sylx Tower, waiting for... something, I guess. The Cloud still remains a threat even after Zande is defeated.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff7characters.html#zangan">Zangan</a> (7) </dt>
<dd>The old martial arts master, who also taught Tifa. He helps out in the Nibelheim fire, but isn't seen after that. He cared for Tifa while she was in a coma from Sephiroth's sword.<p></dd>
<dt>Zaon (10/X-2)</dt>
<dd>Yunalesca's husband became the first Final Aeon and the first Sin way back when. Nobody really knows anything about him other than that.
<br>[X-2] Zaon appears as an Unsent in Via Infinito.
<p></dd>
<dt><a href="fftcharacters.html#zarela">Zarela</a> (Tactics) </dt>
<dd>The Dark Angel, Zarela is the Lucavi assosciated with Elmdore.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff11characters.html#zeid">Zeid</a> (11)</dt>
<dd>A Galkan dark knight.  As a dark knight, he wanders the land, holding no allegiance to anyone but himself, and plays a significant role in most of the events that shape the current state of Vana'diel.  He was a former Mythril Musketeer, but left for unknown reasons.  His position is yet to be filled.  The first time he fought the Shadow Lord and won, he was known as War Cloud.  He faced the Shadow Lord again upon his resurrection and defeated him.  When he revealed to Volker the truth about Ulrich and Cornelia, the two of them fought to a standstill in the tallest tower of Castle Zvahl.  They parted ways, neither opponent claiming victory.  In Rise of the Zilart, he strikes final blow unto Eald'narche.  He later instigated the events of the Chains of Promathia storyline when he went on a quest to retrieve multicolored crystals from ancient Zilart headstones.  This would form a seal in the ruins of Galkan homelands to grant access to all domains of the Zilart.  With Yve'noile's help, he managed to unlock the powers of curelean crystal.<p>
<dt><a href="ff8characters.html#zell">Zell Dincht</a> (8) </dt>
<dd>[HERO] Now here's someone whose mouth always goes before his brain. So full of energy he's sometimes slightly crazed, this youthful martial arts master somehow fails to endear himself to anyone around him besides for an unnamed pigtailed girl. His enormous affinity for the Balamb Garden hot dogs is only coupled with the complete inability to get any due to their demand. A resident of Balamb (he lives there with his mother, who actually adopted him), he joined the Garden at 13 but still, it seems, hasn't attained maturity. He attended the Kramers' orphanage as a child.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff4characters.html#zemus">Zemus/Zeromus</a> (4) </dt>
<dd>[VILLAIN] The true power behind Golbez's evil, Zemus was a Lunarian who wishes to destroy Earth and its inhabitants. He sleeps underground, only being able to control things through his powerful mind. His true power comes from Zeromus, the embodiment of his hate and anger.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff9characters.html#zenero">Zenero</a> (9)</dt>
<dd>One of the three Nero brothers, members of Tantalus. He has a kind of dog-head and claw grips, and apparently says everything with an exclamation mark.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff5characters.html#zeza">Zeza Matias Surgate</a> (5) </dt>
<dd>One of the four Warriors of Dawn, Zeza is an expert swordsman who bears a slight likeness to Odin. He is a selfless man and dedicated to righting wrongs etc. He dislikes being called "king".<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff9characters.html#zidane">Zidane Tribal</a> (9)</dt>
<dd>[HERO] Zidane is a Genome from Terra (with a tail), who was imbued with a soul by Garland and sent to Gaia in case Kuja failed. Unlike Kuja, however, Zidane has a good heart. He ended up being adopted by Baku and becoming a member of the Tantalus troupe. The thing first on his mind in any situation is wooing the opposite sex. Although he falls for Dagger as soon as he sees her (then again, he does that for any girl), it takes her a little longer to accept him. He uses knives and thief swords in battle, and can steal from enemies.<p></dd>
<dt>Zilart King (11)</dt>
<dd>Name unknown.  He created the amulets worn by Kuluu to monitor their thoughts and force them into slavery.  <p>
<dt><a href="ff5characters.html#zokk">Zok</a> (5) </dt>
<dd>An old man who lives in Tule, he was the one who built Torna Canal; he has the key to it. He's known Reina since she was a child and admonishes Bartz to watch over her.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff8characters.html#watzon">Zone</a> (8) </dt>
<dd>The third piece of Rinoa's rebel faction, the Forest Owls, who tends to get major stomachaches whenever real action has to happen. He also has an affinity for girlie mags.<p></dd>
<dt>Zonpa-Zippa (11)</dt>
<dd>Tarutaru responsible for creating the cardians.  When he found the many Cardians difficult to manage, he created four "Ace" cardians.  With this innovation, he became a hero of Tarutaru.  Before start of crystal war, he was kidnapped in a plot by the Ace Cardians to resurrect Joker.<p>
<dt><a href="ff9characters.html#zorn">Zorn</a> (9)</dt>
<dd>One of Brahne's two unspeakably annoying jester sidekicks, who later side with Kuja when he beats Brahne. They're the ones who cast the eidolon-sucking spell with Dagger and (later) Eiko. Like all RPG twins, they join to make a two-headed boss. Zorn is the blue-colored one who speaks in normal sentences.<p></dd>
<dt><a href="ff10characters.html#zuke">Zuke, Father</a> (10)</dt>
<dd>One of Lulu's previous pilgrimages had her follow Father Zuke; he quit, though, and ended up in the Calm Lands. He doesn't have much to do with the current story. Voiced by Andre Sojliuzzo.<p></dd>
