<p><b>12 Centuries Ago</b>
<p><ul><li>The current rulership is the Holy Empire Yudora. The current religion is the Fara Church.
<li>Ajora Glabados born in Bervenia Free City; raised in Milodos. He prophesizes that a well will bring "great trouble" and demands that it is sealed; as it turns out, the water from that well is tainted and anyone who drank from it died soon after. Thus Ajora's fame began to grow.
<li>Ajora begins to prophesize of the arrival of a "kingdom from a higher source". Ajora gains several disciples and the Fara Church begins to experience antipathy for him.
<li>Information comes to the Yudora Empire that Ajora is actually a spy, taking money from the highest bidder and spreading information around. They dispatch Germonik, their own spy, to verify the account.
<li>Germonik discovers several Holy Stones which he believes Ajora to be using to try to revive the Zodiac Braves. Although the spy allegations were never proved, the Empire fears that Ajora is trying to stir up some unknown chaos in the Empire.
<li>Germonik tells the Empire of Ajora's whereabouts. Ajora is captured and executed at Golgollada Gallows.
<li>Ajora's disciple Balias is chased by Holy Empire Yudora. He hides out at Balias Swale and is forced to Balias Tor, where he is killed.
<li>A giant wave submerges the Fara Church Capital. Believing this to be supernatural, the Glabados Church is formed and overtakes the old Fara Church.
<li>Germonik writes the Germonik Scriptures, detailing the truth about himself and St. Ajora.
</li></ul>
<p><b>The Zodiac Brave Legend</b>
<p><ul><li>Ivalice before its unification is divided into seven separate provinces: Zeltennia, Fovoham, Lionel, Limberry, Lesalia, Gallione, and Murond. Warring takes place over hundreds of years as to who will gain the upper hand. A particularly evil king summons a dark lord from the Lucavi Demons to help him, but the demon kills him. 12 heroes dubbed "Zodiac Braves" appear wielding the 12 Zodiac Stones and banish the demon back to Hell.
<li>The Glabados Church takes advantage of this story to say that a similar story happened to St. Ajora (a king of Limberry summoned a demon; Ajora and the 12 Zodiac Braves killed it).
</li></ul>
<p><b>The Fifty Year War</b>
<ul><li>The ruler of Ivalice is King Denamunda; the ruler of neighboring Ordalia is King Diwanu. The leader of the Ivalice Order of the Northern Sky is Barbaneth Beoulve; the leader of the Order of the Southern Sky is Cidolfus Orlandeau. There also exists a third group, the Touten Knights, a valiant member of which is Goffard Gaffgarion. Gustav Margriff is a Hokuten Knight.
<li>King Diwanu of Ordalia dies and is succeeded by his brother Valowa.
<li>Zelamonia is a territory of Ivalice running along the Ordalian border. Unrest there causes its nobles to appeal to King Denamunda. He declares war on Ordalia.
<li>While Ivalice's army marches on Bura, Ordalia's capital, King Denamunda falls ill and dies. He is succeeded by his son Denamunda II.
<li>A stalemate in the war is reached due to an invasion by Romanda. Romanda is a militant nation separated from Ivalice by the Larner Channel; its king is a blood relative to King Valowa of Ordalia.
<li>A bout of Bubonic Plague (Black Death) assails the Romandan army and they retreat after three years of war.
<li>Denamunda II dies (believed to be assassinated) and is succeeded by his son Ondoria. Ondoria is a weak-willed man and unfit to rule; all the decisions are made by his wife Louveria.
<li>King Valowa of Ordalia dies and is succeeded by his son Prince Lanard.
<li>Because of Ondoria's weakness, Ivalice is pressured to end the war. However, because of the fearful strength of Barbaneth and Orlandeau, the leaders of the Nanten and Order of the Northern Sky, Ivalice does not surrender but instead a mutual peace is agreed upon.
</li></ul>
<p><b>During the Fifty Year War:</b>
<ul><li>Gaffgarion is dismissed from the Touten Knights and Gustav is dismissed from the Order of the Northern Sky, both on true charges of contemptible conduct during battle. Gaffgarion becomes a mercenary, selling to the highest bidder.
<li>King Ondoria's two sons die. He adopts his much younger sister Ovelia as his daughter.
<li>Grand Duke Gerrith Barrington adopts Rapha and Marach Galthena. When they grow up, he puts them as leaders of his elite assassination group Kamyuja, which is later disbanded.
<li>The Knights of Death, an anti-aristocratic terrorist group, are disbanded. Their leader is Wiegraf Folles; his second-in-command is Gustav Margriff, after his dismissal from the Hokuten.
<li>Priest Bremondt of Lionel becomes insanely jealous at the love shared between Beowulf Kadmas, head of the Lionel Knights Templar, and his sweetheart Reis. In a fit of anger, he casts a curse on Beowulf, but Reis intercepts it, sacrificing herself. The curse turns her into a dragon form, in which all her memories are erased. She leaves in humiliation, and Beowulf quits the Knights Templar to begin searching for her.
<li>Barbaneth Beoulveallows Delita and Teta Heiral to live in Eagrose Castle with his family. Delita becomes fast friends with his son Ramza, and Teta and Alma (Barbaneth's daughter) also become very close.
</li></ul>
<p><b>The War of the Lions (beginning of the game)</b>
<ul>
<i>Chapter One: The Meager</i> (So called because of an exchange between Wiegraf and Ramza where Wiegraf claims that Ramza has never known "the meager" - living in poverty.
<li>Barbaneth Beoulvefalls ill and dies (poisoned by his son Dycedarg in a long-range plot to gain the throne). Zalbaag Beoulve becomes leader of the Order of the Northern Sky.
<li>Ramza Beoulve and Delita Heiral are sent to the Gariland Military Academy; Alma Beoulve and Teta Heiral attend the Eagrose Aristocratic School.
<li>King Ondoria and Queen Louveria have another son, Orinus.
<li>The Knights of Death resurface as the Corpse Brigade. Due to the turmoil caused by the war, they run rampant throughout Ivalice. Eagrose Castle concerns itself with ousting them.
<li>Ramza, Delita, and their group of Hokuten cadets have their first battle in Magic City Gariland with a band of thieves. They decide to travel to Eagrose Castle to await orders regarding the Corpse Brigade.
<li>On the way, they find Argath Thadalfus, a Hokuten cadet under Marquis Elmdore (the leader of Limberry), beset by Corpse Brigade soldiers. They rescue Argath, and upon his discovery that Ramza is a Beoulve, he begs them to let him accompany him to Eagrose. The Marquis has been kidnapped by Gustav, second-in-command of the Corpse Brigade, and a ransom is demanded. (Dycedarg and Prince Larg put him up to it, giving them an excuse to concentrate all their forces in destroying the Corpse Brigade.)
<li>Upon reaching Eagrose Castle, Dycedarg forbids Ramza, Delita, and Argath from chasing the Marquis, fearing that if they rescue him the Hokuten's excuse will be negated. However, Ramza finds out from Zalbaag that a spy searching for the Marquis was last seen in Dorter Trade City. He resolves to travel there; Delita and Argath accompany him.
<li>They pass through The Siedge Weald, where they are attacked by monsters.
<li>They explore Dorter until they happen upon the Dorter Slums. There, they find Wiegraf, leader of the Corpse Brigade, threatening a Corpse Brigade fencer until he divulges the whereabouts of the Marquis. (Wiegraf is angry that Gustav acted without his permission, giving the Hokuten an opening to attack the Corpse Brigade.) Wiegraf leaves, but the fencer and his group attack Ramza's cadets. After beating them, Argath gives a very harsh treatment to the fencer until he tells them that the Marquis has been hidden in the Sand Rat's Sietch in Zeklaus Desert. Ramza and Delita are shocked by Argath's ridiculously harsh views of commoners.
<li>Wiegraf beats Ramza to the Sand Rat's Sietch and confronts Gustav. Gustav pulls a sword, but Wiegraf kills him first. Ramza and his cadets fight through the guards of the Sand Rat's Sietch to find Wiegraf, a dead Gustav, and a tied up Marquis. Ramza lets Wiegraf go in exchange for the Marquis.
<li>Ramza and co. travel back to Eagrose Castle. Dycedarg is upset with them, but Prince Larg enters and commends Ramza's work. (Larg later tells Dycedarg that even with the Marquis alive, the Corpse Brigade' audacity would still have to be dealt with; and Ramza has proven his ability as a warrior.) Dycedarg sends Ramza to the Brigands' Den to deal with a cadre of Corpse Brigade there.
<li>Milleuda Folles, Wiegraf's sister, leads the cadre at the Brigands' Den. Ramza, although unwilling to fight her, must. She escapes, however, and declares her undying hatred for the Beoulves and all nobles.
<li>Gragoroth Levigne, a member of the Corpse Brigade, carries out an assassination attempt on Dycedarg which was foiled by Zalbaag, but not before he badly wounds Dycedarg. To allow his escape, Gragoroth takes Teta Heiral, Delita's sister, as a hostage. He escapes with her to the windmill on Fovoham Windflats.
<li>Ramza, Delita, and Argath return to Eagrose Castle to hear the news. Argath makes several disgusting remarks about commoners and Ramza dismisses him, demanding never to see him again. However, Argath tells them about the Corpse Brigade base at Ziekden Fortress before he leaves. Ramza and Delita head towards there.
<li>To get there, they pass through Lenalian Plateau, where Milleuda is stationed. They are forced to fight again, and Milleuda is killed.
<li>Ramza reaches Fovoham Windflats and is confronted by Wiegraf. He beats him, but Wiegraf escapes. Delita rushes into the windmill to find that Gragoroth and Teta are gone; they escaped to Ziekden Fortress.
<li>Ramza and Delita reach Ziekden Fortress to find Gragoroth holding Teta as a hostage. However, Zalbaag, Argath, and the Hokuten are also there. Argath, at Zalbaag's order, shoots Teta with a crossbow. With Gragoroth's hostage gone, he is also shot. Fatally wounded, he shuts himself in the fort. Delita's rage overflows and he and Ramza fight Argath, who dies. Delita rushes to Teta, who's badly wounded. However, Gragoroth ignites the huge store of explosives in the fort. Ramza turns tail and runs, but Delita cannot move from his grief. However, Teta shields him from the blasts with her last energy. (After the explosion and commotion, Ramza remains unaware that Delita is alive.)
<p><i>Chapter Two: The Manipulative and the Subservient</i> (So called because the true natures of the war come out: that of the manipulative Church and the unknowingly subservient Princes Larg and Goltanna.)
<li>King Ondoria falls ill and dies. A battle for the guardianship of Prince Orinus breaks out between Prince Larg, Louveria's brother, and Prince Goltanna, Ondoria's first cousin.
<li>Ramza, unsure of his state of life, changes his last name to Ruglia and joins Gaffgarion's mercenary group (which currently only has one other member, a squire named Ladd). Gaffgarion is now the only person who knows Ramza's real identity (besides Delita and Ramza's siblings).
<li>Delita, who escaped Ziekden Fortress thanks to Teta, meets with members of the Murond Glabados Church and convinces them that he wishes to join their cause. He starts a long string of double-crossing, first becoming a member of the Blackram Knights under Baron Grims, a Nanten Knight leader; he quickly rises to second-in-command. However, the Black Sheep and Baron Grims are wiped out by the Ryomoku, an assassin group led by Grand Duke Gerrith Barrington. Delita instead joins the Hokuten and rises to the rank of Holy Knight, while still allegedly being loyal to Goltanna behind Larg's back, being loyal to the Church behind even Goltanna's back, and planning on double-crossing even the Church at the end.
<li>Gaffgarion and group are hired by the Order of the Northern Sky to attend Agrias Oaks, the bodyguard of Princess Ovelia. She is stationed in Orbonne Monastery, under the auspices of Priest Simon Penn-Lachish. The monastery is given the Holy Stone Virgo, which is a royal keepsake, for proof of her status. The job of Agrias and her knights is to protect the Princess at all costs; Gaffgarion is hired to help her.
<li>Minister Gelwan, a close aide to Goltanna, defects to the side of Larg and Queen Louveria. Larg, who knows he will be named guardian to Prince Orinus, wants Ovelia dead; Gelwan suggests kidnapping her and taking her to Fort Besselat, where she is to be executed. At the same time, they can frame Goltanna for the crime by sending the kidnappers in Nanten dress. Delita is the backup for the disguised Hokuten; he is to carry out the actual kidnapping while the disguised Hokuten keep Agrias and Gaffgarion busy. They are then to meet at Zeirchele Falls, where they will continue to Bethla. (Then why hire Gaffgarion to protect her at all? My guess is to make a grand show of his desire to protect the princess, thus proving that it must have been Goltanna who kidnapped her. He purposely throws away the lives of the front-line Hokuten to Gaffgarion and Agrias, knowing that Delita will sneak through the back and accomplish his purpose anyway.) Queen Louveria gives the order for the kidnapping to take place.
<li>Gelwan's plan is carried out: The Hokuten meet defeat at the hands of Ramza, Gaffgarion, and Agrias, but Delita steals the princess away on a Chocobo. Ramza sees him and feels a need to find out what happened to him and why he's in Goltanna's army. He insists on following Agrias to rescue Ovelia. Agrias agrees and tells him that they must have taken her to the impenetrable fortress, Fort Besselat.
<li>On the way to Bethla, Agrias, Gaffgarion, and Ramza pass through Dorter Trade City. Folmarv of the Knights Templar tries to stop them by sending a band of thieves against them, but the thieves are surprised by the inclusion of Gaffgarion in the party, and fall easily.
<li>Ramza and company pass through Araguay Woods, where Boco the Chocobo is beset by Goblins. They save him and he joins them.
<li>Next stop is Zeirchele Falls. Delita refuses to hand over the Princess to the Hokuten, knowing that they'll kill her. He wants to take her back to Goltanna. Agrias, Ramza, and Gaffgarion come upon the scene, and the Hokuten command Gaffgarion to kill the Princess; he agrees, seeing as it's all to contract. Delita joins Ramza and Agrias in fighting Gaffgarion and the Hokuten. Gaffgarion escapes, however. After the battle, Delita, while not telling Ramza anything about his life other than the fact that Teta saved him, agrees to let Ovelia travel with Ramza and Agrias. He leaves to places unknown. Agrias and Ovelia decide to head to Lionel Castle, where Cardinal Draclau can offer protection. (They do not reach Fort Besselat in this leg of the game, by the way.)
<li>(Cardinal Draclau of Lionel Castle controls Baert Ludovich's Baert Trading Company. He orders Ludovich to find a Holy Stone, Taurus, which was rumored to have been discovered in the Clockwork City of Goug. (More about that later.) Ludovich finds the one who allegedly found the stone, named Besrudio Bunansa, and captures him. However, he won't talk, and Ludovich tries to find his son Mustadio, who'll definitely come to rescue his father and will tell the location of the stone in exchange for Besrudio's life.)
<li>The Castled City of Zaland is on the way to Lionel. Ramza and Agrias come upon Mustadio Bunansa, an engineer from the Clockwork City of Goug, being beset by agents from the Baert Trading Company. After rescuing him, he tells them that Baert Company is party to many illegal ventures behind the cover enterprises. His father, Besrudio, has been captured by them. He begs them to take him to Lionel, but won't tell them why Baert Company is chasing him.
<li>Ramza overhears Ovelia pouring her heart out to Agrias. He finds out that Ovelia and Alma were close friends in another monastery, where Ovelia was stationed before she went to Orbonne. Ovelia also wishes that she was never a princess, so people wouldn't have to die because of her...
<li>Ramza, Agrias, and Mustadio must pass through Balias Tor to reach Lionel. Baert Company is there, however. Mustadio still cannot tell Ramza why he's being chased.
<li>Dycedarg orders Gaffgarion to capture Ovelia at any cost, even Ramza's life. He claims that Ramza is a disgrace to the Beoulve name. Gaffgarion is dubious, but orders are orders.
<li>Ramza and co. reach Lionel Castle. Cardinal Draclau agrees to expose Prince Larg's plan, and also offers to rescue Mustadio's father, Besrudio, from the Clockwork City of Goug. However, he shows Mustadio the Scorpio Zodiac Stone and gets him to confess that that was the reason that Baert Company is chasing Besrudio. According to Mustadio, Baert Ludovich wants the Stone to make weapons with. Agrias and Ovelia stay with Draclau in Lionel Castle; Ramza and Mustadio head for the Clockwork City of Goug. (Draclau's soothing words ensure that Ovelia will stay at the castle, while Ramza and Mustadio can give the stone to Ludovich.)
<li>They pass through Tchigolith Fenlands and fight some skeletons, ghouls, and a Malboro.
<li>In the Clockwork City of Goug, Mustadio tells Ramza to wait for him while he checks out the situation. However, Mustadio is captured by Ludovich. He tells him the location of the Zodiac Stone he's looking for (actually a fake) in hopes that he'll let him go; but Ludovich sics his people on Ramza and Mustadio anyway. Before he leaves, he drops a hint that Cardinal Draclau was behind his search for the Taurus Stone. Ramza and Mustadio rescue Besrudio, then Mustadio shows the real Zodiac Stone to Ramza. They decide that they must rescue Ovelia from Draclau, but the main way is closed; they must go by sea.
<li>They reach the Port City of Warjilis. Ramza unexpectedly meets Delita, who warns Ramza to leave Ovelia alone and let Delita take care of things. Delita claims that Larg, Goltanna, and everyone else are unaware that they're being carried along by the same stream, which he is going against. He then exits, leaving Ramza in total confusion.
<li>Draclau gets a visit from Gaffgarion (who's still in Dycedarg's pay). A meeting between the Cardinal, Gaffgarion, and Ludovich takes place. Gaffgarion and Draclau agree to let Ovelia stay in the castle. That way, Ramza (who knows about Prince Larg being the one who actually kidnapped Ovelia) and Mustadio (who has the Taurus Stone) will both fall into their clutches. Draclau (and his alterego Cuchulainn), upset with Ludovich at failing him, kills him.
<li>Balias Swale is on the way to Lionel. Ramza and Mustadio find Agrias running away from the Lionel Knights, and they rescue her. She tells them that Draclau and his cohorts are planning to execute the Princess at the Golgollada Gallows nearby; they rush there.
<li>The executioner at the site turns out to be Gaffgarion; the Princess is a fake. Gaffgarion set a trap for Ramza at Draclau's request. Ramza and his band beat him, however, and rush to Lionel Castle to rescue the real princess.
<li>Delita visits Ovelia in her cell, but Folmarv, the leader of the Knights Templar, and Cardinal Draclau enter the cell before he can finish what he has to say. Folmarv informs her that she's not really Prinvess Ovelia, but a double. (I'm confused about this - the character information still seems to say she's the real Ovelia.) Then Folmarv, Draclau, and Delita leave.
<li>Wiegraf, mourning for his sister Milleuda on the Lenalia Plateau, is visited by Loffrey the Knight Templar. He is convinced to join their cause. Although Loffrey claims that their goals are the same, the Knights Templars' true purpose (and that of the Glabados Church) is to collect the Holy Stones and resurrect the Zodiac Braves.
<li>Another trap has been set at the main gate of Lionel Castle. Gaffgarion traps Ramza behind the gate, while his troops fight Ramza's in front of the gate. Managing to open the gate, the battle becomes a free-for-all, with Ramza finally beating Gaffgarion, who dies. Ramza rushes into Lionel Castle.
<li>(PSP Only) Delita and Ovelia, reaching Zeirchele Falls, are attacked by the Northern Sky. Ovelia finally realizes that her previous protectors are out to kill her, and willingly goes with Delita.
<li>Ramza confronts Draclau, who tries to dissuade him from rescuing the Princess, urging him to follow his brothers. Ramza adamantly refuses, and demands to see Ovelia. Draclau tells him that she's been taken to Zeltennia Castle, then he takes out his Holy Stone and calls the power of Cuchulainn, the Impure. Ramza and his band defeat Cuchulainn, who dies and disappears, leaving only his Scorpio Zodiac Stone behind.
<li>Goltanna holds a meeting: Gelwan, Kanbabrif (his aides), Orlandeau (leader of the Order of the Southern Sky), his adpoted son Orran, and Delita attend. Delita enters, telling Goltanna that he has the princess with him. He also has a prisoner, one of the Hokuten who originally helped kidnap Ovelia. He exposes Minister Gelwan, and Delita kills him then and there. Delita demands that Goltanna storm Lesalia Capital, depose Louveria and Orinus, and institute Ovelia as queen.
<li>Goltanna rushes Lesalia and imprisons Queen Louveria in Fort Besselat for the crime of kidnapping Ovelia. However, Larg declares himself Orinus's guardian and affirms him as king of Ivalice. At the same time, Goltanna claims that Ovelia has the real claim to the throne. Thus begins the "War of the Lions".
<li>The first battle occurs at Gulofavia, with heavy casualties to both sides, and over 400,000 wounded. In addition to this, a huge drought begins throughout Ivalice, crippling both sides.
<li>Both the Hokuten and the Nanten head to Fort Besselat to fight over Queen Louveria.
<li>Goltanna has a meeting in Fort Besselat. Attendees are Goltanna, Orlandeau, Bolmna, and Blansh (the latter two are aides to Goltanna). Goltanna decides to raise taxes for the farmers because of the high prices of grain due to the draught; Orlandeau dismisses this idea as ridiculous. He asks Prince Goltanna to try a peace treaty with Larg, seeing as both sides are being beset by the draught and lack of food, as well as heavy losses of manpower. Goltanna and his aides flare up at this and Goltanna declares that any more harsh words on Orlandeau's part will cost him his life.
<p><i>Chapter Three: The Valiant</i> (So called because Ramza, in a conversation with Rapha, finally realizes that he is not fighting for honor, but because he craves justice.)
<li>Ramza heads to Lesalia Capital to tell his brother Zalbaag that someone is manipulating the war.
<li>On the way he passes through the Mining Town of Gollund. There, Orran Durai (Orlandeau's adopted son) has stumbled onto a thieves' hideout. The thieves decide to kill Orran, but Ramza saves him (not that he needs too much saving!) He is surprised upon hearing that Ramza is a Beoulve but leaves him peacefully without telling him his true identity.
<li>Ramza reaches Lesalia. He tries to tell Zalbaag about the manipulation and that Dycedarg spearheaded Ovelia's capture, but Zalbaag refuses to believe him. Before he can be convinced, a Hokuten knight enters and brings news that Orlandeau and the Nanten have broken through Dugeura Pass. Zalbaag leaves.
<li>Alma, who's also in Lesalia, catches up with Ramza at the back gate of the castle. He tells her about Dycedarg and Delita, and she begs to come along; Ramza refuses. Their talk is cut short by the arrival of Zalmour Lucianada, a Pagan Examiner for the Glabados Church. He declares Ramza a heretic for the "murder" of Cardinal Draclau and demands that he comes with him. Ramza defeats Zalmour, who disappears. Alma tells Ramza that she's seen one of those Holy Stones he's dealing with, at Orbonne Monastery. However, as a heretic, Ramza can't get into Orbonne himself, so he's forced to bring Alma with him.
<li>At Orbonne, Ramza finds Simon wounded. Simon tells him that the Knights Templar have arrived looking for the Virgo Holy Stone. Isilud is leading them and is looking through the underground library to find the Stone. Ramza tells Alma to stay with Simon, and gives her his two Stones (Taurus and Scorpio). He chases Isilud.
<li>Isilud disappears, and grabs Alma on the way out. Ramza, chasing the Knights Templar, finds Wiegraf, now a Templar. Wiegraf still wants to get revenge on Ramza for killing his sister Milleuda. However, Ramza defeats him again. Fatally wounded, he teleports out of the monastery. 
<li>Wiegraf's despair and hate react with the Aries Stone and summon Belias, a Lucavi demon. Belias signs a pact with Wiegraf, giving Wiegraf Belias's body and power. Wiegraf/Belias disappears. Simon crawls out of the monastery and gives Ramza a book called the Germonik Scriptures; then he dies from his wounds.
<li>The Scriptures tell the true story of St. Ajora and dispel the Church's claims that he's a Son of God.
<li>Upon traveling back to Dorter, Ramza is confronted by Marach Galthena, a Netherseer. He tells Ramza that if he wishes to see Alma again, he must bring the Germonik Scriptures to Riovanes Castle.
<li>Delita finds Ovelia crying in the ruins of Zeltennia Church. She tells him that since she's a fake, she's worth nothing, not even to live; she wonders what all her suffering was for. Delita comforts her and promises her that she can trust him.
<li>(PSP Only) On the way to Riovanes, Ramza passes through the Zeklaus Desert, where he finds a young game hunter beset by Behemoths. He helps stave them off, and in return the young man, Luso, joins his party. (Luso is in fact a crossover from FF Tactics Advance 2.)
<li>Marquis Elmdore, who switched to Goltanna's side, dies in battle in the Fuse Plains.
<li>The Grogh Heights lies on the way to Riovanes Castle. There, Ramza stumbles on a group of Order of the Southern Sky who wish to desert and quit fighting. However, one of them recognizes Ramza and tells the group to kill him instead; that way, they can leave with an honorable discharge instead of hiding for the rest of their lives. After reluctantly vanquishing them, Ramza is visited by Orran and a group of Order of the Southern Sky. Orran tells Ramza that he's a sympathizer and would risk his life for Ramza and his cause. Ramza asks him if he knows Orlandeau (whom his father Barbaneth said was his only real friend); Orran replies that he's Orran's father-in-law (see <a href="#incon">Inconsistencies</a>). Orran tells Ramza that Orlandeau knows of the conspiracy by the Church but has no evidence; Ramza almost gives him the Germonik Scriptures but remembers his sister's needs. They part on friendly terms.
<li>Next stop is the Walled City of Yardrow. Here, Ramza finds Marach and his sister, Rapha, arguing. Rapha runs from Marach and begs Ramza to save her from him. Ramza does so, and decides to hide for the moment with Rapha in Yardow. Rapha tells Ramza about Grand Duke Barrington and his scheme to gain the Galthenas' Heaven and Hell skills; that he burned their entire village to gain hold of them. She also tells him that Barrington once raped her. Once Rapha discovered the truth about the burnt village, she ran away, but Marach refused to believe it. Rapha says that Barrington wishes to become the regent of Orinus and therefore king, by allowing Larg and Goltanna to kill each other. While they're speaking, a frog with Marach's voice shows up and tells Ramza that the ante has been raised: if he wants to see Alma, he must bring both the Germonik Scriptures <i>and</i> Rapha to Riovanes. Then the frog disappears, leaving Ramza bemused.
<li>(PSP Only) Delita finds Ovelia praying in the ruins of the Zeltennia chapel. However, they are attacked by two Northern Sky assassins, who fire a crossbow at Ovelia. Delita pushes Ovelia out of the way, though the bolt grazes him. The assassins attack him full on, and he slays them.
<li>Next stop is The Yuguewood; here, ghosts of warriors from the Fifty Year War plague Ramza and Rapha.
<li>Grand Duke Barrington is visited by Folmarv. He tells Folmarv that he wants to work with the Knights Templar, who have the Holy Stones, in an effort to bring Barrington to the throne. Folmarv asks why he should listen to Barrington; Barrington calls for Marach, who brings in Isilud (Wiegraf follows them in). Barrington tells Folmarv that he has the Taurus and Scorpio Stones and the Germonik Scriptures as well (although he doesn't technically have it yet). A Nanten Knight interrupts, telling of Ramza's arrival; Marach leaves to deal with him. Barrington threatens to expose the Church's lies if Folmarv doesn't go along with him. In response, Folmarv uses his Zodiac Stone and his alterego Hashmal
 to go on a rampage and kill Barrington's troops; he also fatally wounds Isilud for his incompetency.
<li>At the gate of Riovanes Castle, Ramza and Rapha fight Marach and his troops. When wounded, Marach disappears; Rapha also disappears to follow him. Ramza makes his way inside the castle.
<li>Alma, in her cell, hears horrific sounds of fighting above her. Suddenly, her cell door opens and a mortally wounded knight enters. He tells her to run away, that a dangerous monster is around; then he dies. Alma hesistates, then runs out of her now-open cell.
<li>Ramza enters the castle to find many dead Order of the Southern Sky... and Wiegraf, who challenges him to a duel. After beating him, Wiegraf uses his Aries Stone to turn into Belias. Ramza and friends defeat Belias, and he dies, leaving the Aries Stone behind.
<li>In the meantime, Alma finds her way into the main hall where Folmarv went nuts. She finds Isilud lying on the floor. Isilud tries to warn her about Folmarv but Alma doesn't get the point (she thinks he's talking about Wiegraf, who's already dead). Isilud gives Alma the Pisces Stone and dies. Folmarv then enters. He walks up to Alma, intending to kill her, but his Leo Stone reacts to her. He realizes that she is the embodiment of St. Ajora, and takes her away. She drops the Pisces Stone behind her.
<li>Rapha confronts Barrington on the roof of the castle. She draws her sword, but Barrington takes out a gun. Barrington taunts her, saying that she can't kill him because her body remembers the terror he caused her. Marach overhears him and demands to know if that's true; Barrington fires, but Marach pushes Rapha away and takes the bullet himself. Barrington demands that Rapha take the Taurus Stone (which Marach still has from Isilud) from Marach and give it to him, but before she can, Lettie (an assassin) climbs up behind Barrington and throws him off the roof. Marquis Elmdore (who's been resurrected as a Zodiac Brave) enters and demands the Stone. Ramza and Rapha refuse, and they fight Elmdore and his two assassins. The three foes disappear after the battle, but before they do, Elmdore tells Ramza that if he wants Elmdore's stone, he should come to Limberry Castle.
<li>Rapha, who has Marach's Taurus Stone, weeps over Marach's dead body. Suddenly, the Stone reacts and Marach is brought back to life.
<li>Ramza enters the main hall where Isilud died and finds the Pisces Stone.
<p><i>Chapter Four: In the Name of Love</i> (So called because of the many themes of love throughout this chapter: Delita and Ovelia, Ramza and Alma, Beowulf and Reis, and maybe even Cloud and Aeris.)
<li>Ramza tells Marach and Rapha that he believes that Folmarv is behind the plot of the Zodiac Stones; he tells them that he plans to go to Zeltennia Castle to meet Delita and advise him that he's being used by the Church. He also wishes to meet Count Orlandeau and show him the Germonik Scriptures, and try to convince him to join Ramza's cause.
<li>Prince Larg's Hokuten take an offensive stand and storm Fort Besselat. The war rages on.
<li>Valmafra Lenande, a female magician working for the Murond Glabados Church, is sent to keep an eye on Delita and help him as long as his aims coincide with those of the Church. However, if she finds out that he's double-crossing the Church, she is to kill him.
<li>In Zeltennia Castle, Orran returns to his adoptive father, Orlandeau. Orran unfortunately has nothing to report other than the existence of the Taurus and Scorpio Stones. Orlandeau takes out his own Libra Stone and says that when the truth does come out, the real war will start...
<li>On the way to Zeltennia, Ramza must get through Dugeura Pass, which is guarded by the Order of the Southern Sky.
<li>Next stop is Bervenia Free City. Ramza is surprised by a battle with Meliadoul Tengille, Folmarv's daughter and Isilud's sister. He tries to tell her the truth about her father, but she refuses to listen and disappears after being beaten by Ramza.
<li>(PSP Only) In Zeltennia, Delita overhears Ovelia trying to blow the reed whistle as taught to her by Alma. He shows her how to do it, and she notices a pendant around his neck. He tells her it's to remember his sister Tietra, and Delita swears he will not allow their foes to use Ovelia the way Tietra was used.
<li>Next is Finnath Creek, which is populated by wild Chocobos. Ramza defeats them and moves on.
<li>Ramza meets Delita secretly in Zeltennia Church. Delita tells Ramza the Church's real intentions: to stir revolt among the anti-nobilists, and then to assassinate all the leaders of the armies: Larg, Goltanna, Orlandeau, Zalbaag, and Dycedarg. With the leaders gone, Ivalice will embrace peace and the Church's ways. Delita admits that he's using Ovelia but he has also fallen in love with her. However, their conversation is interrupted by Zalmour, the Pagan Examiner, who has the Church surrounded and demands Ramza to come with him. Ramza and Delita (who refuses to let Zalmour live once he's seen Delita with Ramza the heretic) kill Zalmour.
<li>After the fight, Valmafra shows up. Delita introduces her to Ramza, and she tells Delita that Orlandeau has headed to Fort Besselat to deal with the revolts stirred up by the Church. This is Ramza's next destination.
<p><i>Balthier Subquest (PSP Only)</i>
<li>A rash of thefts against the Glabados clergy has stirred up rumors. Ramza responds to a call for guards to catch the perpetrator in Dorter Free City, but runs into a trap laid by the priests. Ramza aids the thief, Balthier, and fends off the guards. Balthier is looking for the Cache of Glabados, which he hopes can return him home (since it apparently brought him there to begin with). He teams up with Ramza in the hopes he'll find it with the other auracite.
<li>Agrias's Birthday Sidequest (PSP Only)
<li>If Ramza collects enough money and lands on a town on the first of Cancer, a scene will play where Mustadio gives Agrias a Tynar Rouge lipstick for her birthday. He has an obvious crush on her.
<p><i>Chapter 4, Continued</i>
<li>The Beddha Sandwaste lies between Bervenia Free City and Fort Besselat. Here, Ramza is confronted by Barich Fendsor, a Templar. Barich informs him that he has spread a deadly poison called Mossfungus throughout the Hokuten troops. In the confusion caused by it, the Knights Templar plan to kill Goltanna, Orlandeau, and Larg. Barich then infects Ramza and his troops with the poison (luckily Ramza has some Antidotes on hand) and proceeds to fight him. However, Barich is killed by Ramza during the battle.
<li>Count Orlandeau is accused by Prince Goltanna of conspiring with the Church to overthrow him. He is taken to the prison in Bethla, awaiting execution the following morning. Goltanna then appoints Delita the head of the Order of the Southern Sky in Orlandeau's place, and tells him to try to get an official edict from the Church approving Goltanna's position as king. (Goltanna obviously knows of the Church's Mossfungus scandal (the poison was only spread among Hokuten) and therefore thinks the Church is on his side.)
<li>Zalbaag finds Larg in a hill outside Fort Besselat, surrounded by dead and dying Hokuten. Larg, as well as Dycedarg, have been poisoned by Mossfungus, but not badly. However, Dycedarg, as part of his plot to take the throne, stabs Larg. An astonished Larg says that Dycedarg killed his father as well, before dying; Zalbaag is nonplussed. Dycedarg tells a horrified Zalbaag to put the knife in the hands of one of the dead Hokuten, claiming that that dead body was a spy of the Nanten and did the deed. Zalbaag complies, but his mind whirls...
<li>Ramza fights his way past the Nanten guard and manages to open the sluices in Fort Besselat, causing the water to rush out, paralyzing both sides of the battle. Ramza and Orran, accompanied by Valmafra (Delita wants both Ramza and Orlandeau to escape, so that they can defeat the Church after it has served his purposes), rescue Orlandeau from Bethla. Orlandeau sends Orran back to Zeltennia to protect Princess Ovelia, whom he claims is the true heir to the throne. (Orlandeau always believed in Goltanna's cause; otherwise he wouldn't have fought for him. However, the current situation, with Orlandeau being scheduled for execution, is less than favorable.)
<li>Delita confronts Goltanna and stabs him. A member of the Church named Grenados, who's a dead ringer for Orlandeau, dresses up in typical Orlandeau clothes and is stabbed by Delita (Grenados gives up his life for the Church's cause).
<li>With the leaders of both the Nanten and Hokuten gone or dead, High Priest Funebris suggests a mediator; however, the strength of both sides is still enough so that they (Dycedarg and Delita) refuse. Ramza then heads to Limberry Castle to look for Alma.
<li>On the way, they pass Mount Germinas (where they're accosted by bandits who decide to kill Ramza for the bounty) and Poeskas Lake (where ghosts demand his Holy Stones for a chance to rise "to a higher level".
<li>Loffrey Wodring, a Templar, meets with Dycedarg at Eagrose. Dycedarg repeats his refusal to accept the Church's mediation. Loffrey gives him the Capricorn Holy Stone as a "token of good will" - but in reality it's to give the Lucavi demon Adrammelech a host body. Loffrey also hints very strongly to Dycedarg that the Church knows that he poisoned his father with Mossfungus. He suggests that Dycedarg listen to the Church. However, the one who listened, to the entire conversation, was Zalbaag...
<li>Folmarv and Elmdore meet inside Limberry Castle. They comment on Adrammelech's new host, and we find out that they're trying to resurrect a demon called the "Bloody Angel". If the Angel is resurrected, all Lucavi can come and go at will on the real world, without needing hosts. Alma is to be the host for the Angel, but the Angel can only be summoned at a place called the "dead city". Folmarv leaves to look for it, leaving Elmdore and his assassin cohorts, Celia and Lettie (who are actually Ultima Demons in disguise) to fight off Ramza. Ramza defeats the Marquis and his assassins.
<li>(PSP Only) Before being able to reach him, Ramza is attacked by a zombie version of Argath. They taunt each other, but Ramza finally emerges victorious again.
<li>Elmdore retreats to an underground cemetary, then uses his Gemini Stone to turn into the Lucavi demon Zarela. Meliadoul (Folmarv's daughter) suddenly enters the room, astonished at finding out the true power of the Zodiac Stones. Meliadoul and Ramza defeat Zarela.
<li>Meliadoul has her own Holy Stone, Sagittarius, a treasure of her family. She gives it to Ramza for keeping. She now believes Ramza and needs to find out the truth about her father - is he human anymore? She tells Ramza that Folmarv's right-hand man, Loffrey, gave another Holy Stone (Capricorn) to Dycedarg; both she and Ramza want to find out why. (It was to give the Lucavi Adrammelech a body.) Meliadoul joins Ramza's troops.
<li>In Zeltennia, Ovelia (who had been appointed queen by Goltanna before he died) is visited by Orran, whom she seems to know. Orran tells her that Orlandeau did not kill Goltanna, but before he can tell her who it was, Delita, Valmafra, and two Order of the Southern Sky enter. Delita orders the Knights to leave, then tells Ovelia that he wishes to be the people's "hero", one who will restore peace to Ivalice. She's surprised; Delita then tells her to leave. He promises not to hurt Orran. (He thinks perhaps Orran might work for him against the Church.) Ovelia goes to the door (which is out of sight of the three others), opens and closes the door, but stays inside to hear. Delita and Orran have an argument, and Delita declares that all manipulators will die, including the High Priest. He then turns to Valmafra, who has let out a gasp. He tells her that he knows she was sent as an assassin if he turned against the Church. She takes out her knife, but realizes that she can't stab Delita because of her feelings for him; Delita overpowers her.
<li>Zalbaag takes a chemist to visit the grave of his father Barbaneth. The chemist confirms that Mossfungus is growing out of the grave, but the man seems urgent to leave. He tells Zalbaag that Mossfungused corpses are bad luck; they signify the end of that family's dynasty. Zalbaag flips him a coin and stands by Barbaneth's grave, shocked...
<li>Ramza and Meliadoul travel to Eagrose Castle to find the truth about Dycedarg, Loffrey, and the Capricorn Stone. 
<li>(PSP Only) In Dorter, Ramza is confronted by Cletienne. He is frozen by his magicks, but saved by Meliadoul. Meliadoul demands to know her father's true intentions, but Cletienne shrugs her off and disappears.
<li>Ramza reaches Eagrose Castle. There are no guards outside, but Zalbaag's Chocobo is there. Inside the castle, Ramza finds Zalbaag with his sword drawn, intending to kill Dycedarg for his actions against Larg and Balbanes. Dycedarg calls his Order of the Northern Sky to help, but Ramza saves Zalbaag, who kills Dycedarg. Suddenly, Dycedarg's Capricorn Stone begins to glow, and Dycedarg transforms into Adrammelech, the Lucavi demon. Adrammelech kills Zalbaag; his body disappears. Ramza then defeats Adrammelech. He decides to head to Mullonde, headquarters of the Murond Glabados Church, to look for Alma.
<p><i>Cloud Subquest</i>
<li>In the Clockwork City of Goug, Besrudio has found a strange steel device from many centuries ago. It bears the mark of Aquarius, and reacts to Ramza's Holy Stones.
<li>In the Mining Town of Gollund, Ramza hears a rumor about a strange, powerful monster living in the Goland Colliery.
<li>In the Royal City of Lesalia, Ramza overhears the same rumor again. He tells the bartender he might want to go and kill the monster. Beowulf Kadmas, a hunter, asks Ramza if he can join him on this quest; Ramza agrees.	
<li>The Goland Colliery is inexplicably guarded by Chemists and dragons. When Ramza and Beowulf reach the inner chamber, they find a Holy Dragon named Reis whom Beowulf seems to know. Reis, who holds the Aquarius Holy Stone, is being beset by an Archaeodaemon named Schinoeg, who demands the stone. Beowulf and Ramza rescue Reis from the Demon and Reis joins Ramza's fight.
<li>Back in Goug, Ramza puts the Aquarius stone in the steel device. It turns out to be a robot named Construct 8 who claims that Ramza is his master; he joins him.
<li>In the Trade City of Sal Ghidos, Ramza meets a flower girl named Aeris (from FF7). He buys a flower from her.
<li>Back in Goug, Besrudio has found yet another device. This one looks like some kind of heavenly chart mechanism. It also reacts to Ramza's Holy Stones, and the sign of Cancer is on it. Ramza leaves to look for this Stone.
<li>In Zeltennia Castle, a rumor circulates about Nelveska Temple. It's also known as "Cursed Island" and rumors of a Holy Stone and an iron guard are rampant. Ramza heads there from Zeltennia. 
<li>In Nelveska Temple, Ramza comes upon an Automaton named Construct 7-new, an identical clone of Construct 8. This Steel Giant is also powered by a Zodiac Stone, in this case the Cancer Stone. Construct 7-new, who appears to be guarding the now-empty temple without regard to the fact that there are no more inhabitants, attacks Ramza. Ramza defeats it and obtains the Cancer Stone.
<li>Beowulf gives Reis the Cancer Stone; the stone reacts to her and lifts her curse, transforming her back into a human.
<li>Returning once more to Goug, Ramza puts the Cancer Stone in the new device. It summons a very strange-looking young man (Cloud, also from FF7), who runs away.
<li>Back in Zarghidas, Cloud meets Aeris and notices something familiar about her. 8-) Then, a bunch of ruffians gang up on Aeris. Apparently she has to pay them a large amount of money for an undisclosed reason. They ridicule her, then Cloud comes to her rescue. They forget Aeris and attack Cloud, but Ramza shows up to save him. Cloud joins Ramza's party.
<p><i>Chapter 4, continued</i>
<li>In Mullonde, High Priest Funebris is cornered by the three head Knights Templar: Folmarv, Loffrey, and Cletienne. Folmarv stabs Funebris, but tells him that the wound would heal. Folmarv offers to save Funebris's life in exchange for the whereabouts of Murond Death City. Funebris finally blurts out the location - in a Magic Square in the deepest level of Orbonne Monastery. However, Funebris doesn't know how to open it - but it must mention it in the Germonik Scriptures. Folmarv nods to Loffrey as he leaves to look for Ramza and the Scriptures; Loffrey plunges his sword into Funebris's back and leaves him there.
<li>Ramza fights his way into Mullonde, but he is stopped by the three Knights Templar. They demand all of his Holy Stones and the Germonik Scriptures, in exchange for Alma. He gives them the Scriptures, but refuses to give them the Stones until they give him Alma. Loffrey reads the Scriptures and finds the chant to open the Magic Square; then the Knights Templar betray Ramza and attack him. Ramza defeats them and they disappear.
<li>Further into the Mullonde is (for reasons unknown) a room with a large coffin. Folmarv summons three Demons and a surprise attacker - Zalbaag! The Lucavi are controlling his body, which is now undead. Zalbaag begs Ramza to kill him. Ramza reluctantly does, and Zalbaag disappears in a flash of sound and color, never to return.
<li>Ramza finally reaches the innermost sanctuary of Mullonde, where Funebris lies with a sword in his back. Funebris is still barely alive, but can only twitch his hand and whisper one word before he dies: "Orbonne". Ramza heads to Orbonne for the final sequence of battles.
<p><i>Deep Dungeon Subquest</i>
<li>In the Port City of Warjilis, Ramza overhears a conversation about an ancient lighthouse called Deep Dungeon. The Dungeon holds lots of amazing treasure, and is home to many dangerous monsters. The Dungeon has ten levels, each harder than the next. When Ramza finally fights his way to the final level, he is confronted by another surprise: the wizard Elidibus. Elidibus (a former graduate of Gariland Military Academy who fought for Ivalice in the Fifty Year War) has yet another Zodiac Stone, Serpentarius. He transforms into a Lucavi demon and attacks Ramza. Ramza (aided by a mysterious monster called a Byblos) defeats Elidibus and takes his Serpentarius Stone.
<p><i>Disorder in the Order Subquest (PSP Only)</i>
<li>If Ramza goes to Zeltennia Castle, a scene plays where Agrias reunites with Ovelia. Delita walks in on the meeting, and despite Agrias's anger at him, she asks him to protect her. As Agrias takes her leave of Ovelia, she takes Ovelia's hand and slips her a knife, to protect herself.
<li>After this, rumors surface of Northern Sky deserters holing up in the Brigands' Den. Ramza can defeat these remnants as well.
<p><i>Lionel's New Liege Lord Subquest (PSP Only)</i>
<li>These events occur after finishing Nelveska Temple and Mullonde.
<li>When visiting Lionel Castle, Beowulf and Reis reminisce about their homeland. Beowulf leaves to help Ramza, but hears a scream. He rushes back to see Reis gone but Aliste standing there. Aliste tells him that he has kidnapped Reis on the orders of Celebrant Bremondt, the new liege lord of Lionel after the fall of Cardinal Delacroix, and if Beowulf wants to see her again he should come to the gates of Lionel Castle. In fact, however, Aliste has no intention of allowing the Cardinal to get away with this kidnapping. He drugs the guards inside the castle to ensure that if Beowulf overpowers him, he would have an easy passage to the Cardinal.
<li>Beowulf is attacked by Aliste at the gates. After a long battle, Aliste finally falls, at which point he tells Beowulf that he would have died anyway, of a malady. He is happy that his end was quick, and urges Beowulf to rescue Reis.
<li>Ramza and Beowulf confront Bremondt in the oratory of the castle. Bremondt, clearly nervous and overpowered, promises wealth to his guards if they defeat their foes. Beowulf tries to make Bremondt see reason - that Reis has never loved him, regardless of how much money he gives her, but Bremondt is half-crazed and refuses to listen to reason. As a last resort, Bremondt uses dark powers to turn into a Dark Dragon. Beowulf and Ramza defeat it. Bremondt reverts back to human form, dead. Beowulf finally rescues Reis, and thanks Ramza for his help.
<p><i>Chapter 4: Final Battles</i>
<li>Ramza fights his way past the hordes of Knights Templar guarding Orbonne Monastery. He meets Loffrey in the lowest reaches of the Monastery. Ramza defeats him, but Loffrey then opens the gate to Murond Death City, sucking Ramza's party and himself inside. He then destroys the entrance, trapping Ramza there. Loffrey tells him that his sister is waiting. Ramza demands to know where, but Loffrey dies. Ramza sees a flash of light and follows it.
<li>In the Murond Death City, Ramza is challenged by Cletienne. He defeats him and continues to the Lost Sacred Precincts, where he is again challenged, this time by Barich who has been brought back from the dead as a Zodiac Brave. Barich is defeated again, and Ramza continues to the Graveyard of Airships.
<li>This place is where St. Ajora's soul lives. Folmarv is attempting to use Alma's body to ressurrect St. Ajora, but the Virgo Stone is not responding. Ramza then arrives. Folmarv decides that Ajora needs more bloodshed to return; he transforms into the Lucavi demon Hashmal
 and fights Ramza. After being beaten, Hashmal
 decides to sacrifice himself for Ajora. Alma's body begins to glow and St. Ajora takes over her body.
<li>Somehow, Alma's will fights against Ajora and her real body appears beside Ajora. Ajora becomes enraged and summons four Ultima Demons, then transforms into Ultima, the Bloody Angel. Ramza's troops begin to prevail against him. The Ultima Demons disappear, and Ultima gathers even more power, but Ramza defeats him. Ultima's final death throes completely destroy the entire airship...
<li>A poignant funeral service is held for Alma (in the name of St. Ajora, no less). Ramza, being a heretic, was denied a funeral. Orran and Valmafra show up late and Orran lays flowers at Alma's grave. However, Orran is completely surprised when he sees Ramza and Alma pass by on Chocobos! He tries to chase after them, but they quickly ride out of his sight. No one ever sees either of them again, and history is unsure as to whether they truly died in Murond Death City, or whether he survived and remained in peace with his sister for the rest of his life.
<p><i>Epilogue</i>
<li>Delita marries Ovelia and becomes king of Ivalice.
<li>However, the apparent deaths of Ramza and Alma slowly eat away at Ovelia's sanity. Several years after she married King Delita, on her birthday, she hides away in the ruins of Zeltennia Church (where Delita once comforted her when she cried). Delita finally finds her and has a boquet of flowers for her, but Ovelia, crazed with grief, rushes at him with a dagger (the same one given to her by Agrias) and stabs him. She accuses him of killing Ramza, and that he plans on killing her as well. Delita, shocked, pulls the knife out and stabs Ovelia with it. Weak with pain, he limps a few steps, then wonders, "Did you get your end in all of this, Ramza? I...I got this..." before all goes black.
<li>Orran completes his work, the Durai Writings, chronicling the truth behind the Church, the Knights Templar, and Ramza's actions. He plans on presenting them to Prince Clemence on the occasion of his coronation. However, the Church apprehends Orran before he can do so, proclaims him a heretic, and burns him at the stake. The Durai Writings are confiscated and hidden away deep in Mullonde.
</li></ul>
<p><b>400 Years Later</b>
<ul><li>Alazlam J. Durai, a descendent of Orran, discovers the Durai Writings during his work as a historian. He attempts to piece together the truth of what happened during the War of the Lions... and thus the game begins.</li></ul>
<p><center><b><a name="incon">Inconsistencies</a></b></center>
<p>There are several things which aren't clearly defined or which contradict each other throughout the game. Here's a (very) short list of them.
<ul><li>Folmarv tells Princess Ovelia that she's not the real princess. However, the character info still lists her as Ondoria's sister whom he adopted, and no clarification of her "fake" status is ever made after this. She does call Orlandeau her "Uncle"...
<!-- <LI>The Record log says that Delita framed Gelwan for the kidnapping of Ovelia, but Rumors and other facts point to Gelwan actually doing it.-->
<li>When Orran meets Ramza in Yardow he tells him that he's Orlandeau's son-in-law; however, the "Person" information gives details on Orran being Orlandeau's adopted son; Orran later calls Orlandeau his stepfather.
<li>If you think of any others, <a href="feedback.html">E-mail me</a>.</li></ul>
