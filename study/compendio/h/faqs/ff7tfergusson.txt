VERSION HISTORY
---------------

v1.0 : 21/04/99 : Original Release
v1.1 : 05/09/00 : GameShark and GameHack Codes Added, plus additional Guides

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FOREWORD
--------

One of the many mysteries of FF7, has always been the Gold Saucer Date.
Numerous guides and FAQs have listed ways of how to date Yuffie, or Aeris, or
Tifa, or even Barret; but still, some of them have included unnecessary
tasks, or failed in execution.

To this end, I have compiled what I know of the date, and what determines
who you date.  You should be able to use this guide to end with any of the
four options you wish.  This is a generic guide; you can use it to decide
precisely what you want to do, and allow you to determine what the end
product will be.

Note: I am not sure whether I have tested *all* possibilities, but I am
certain I have gotten a large majority of them.  If you find something that
seems to have an effect on the date, and it is not listed here, then I will
be glad to hear it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE AFFECTION VALUES
--------------------

There are four values in the game, and I have termed them 'Affection' values
for the purpose of this document.  At the start of the game, they are set as
thus:
  Aeris:  50
  Tifa:   30
  Yuffie: 10
  Barret:  0

As the game proceeds, certain decisions or tasks you undertake will amend
them.  When you reach the date, whoever has the highest Affection value will
be the one chosen for the cutscene.  If, however, there is a tie for the
highest, then the priorities are thus: Aeris, then Tifa, then Yuffie, and
finally Barret.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
GAMESHARK/GAMEHACK CODES
------------------------

This table is for the PSX version, using a GameShark.

                           GameShark (US)    GameShark (UK)   
 Aeris' Affection Value:   3009D28B 00xx     3009D156 00xx
 Tifa's Affection Value:   3009D28C 00xx     3009D157 00xx
 Yuffie's Affection Value: 3009D28D 00xx     3009D158 00xx
 Barret's Affection Value: 3009D28E 00xx     3009D159 00xx



This table is for the PC UK version, using the software known as GameHack.
The Riva column is for those with the latest Riva patch installed (the one
that adds both Riva 128 and Riva TNT compatibility).  It's possible that
these codes will also work for the US version, but I cannot vouch for
them in that respect.

                           GameHack          GameHack (Riva)
 Aeris' Affection Value:   00DB1EC7          00DC08DF
 Tifa's Affection Value:   00DB1EC8          00DC08E0
 Yuffie's Affection Value: 00DB1EC9          00DC08E1
 Barret's Affection Value: 00DB1ECA          00DC08E2


Remember that whoever's Affection Value is *highest* will be the one
showcased on the 'date' sequence.

Due to the fact that I have little access to any version other than the UK
PC version, I cannot vouch for the accuracy of the codes listed here, nor
can I provide codes for other versions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE DECISIONS

Talking to Aeris the first time, no matter what you say (believe it or not),

    "Thanks anyway"         --
    "Looking forward to it" (-3 Tifa)

    If Tifa is in it:  (+1 Tifa)



Kalm
----
When Barret leaves, and tells you to get a move on:
    "Wait a sec"                     --
        "Beautiful, just beautiful!" (+3 Barret)
        "Is that all?"               (-1 Barret)

Fort Condor
-----------
When you first talk to the old guy in Fort Condor:
    "I guess so"     (+5 Barret, +3 Aeris, +3 Tifa, +2 Yuffie)
    "Not interested" (-5 Barret, -3 Aeris, -3 Tifa, -1 Yuffie)

After the old guy tells you about his problem:
    "All right"      (+5 Barret, +3 Aeris, +3 Tifa, +2 Yuffie)
    "Not interested" (-5 Barret, -3 Aeris, -3 Tifa, -1 Yuffie)



Meeting Yuffie
--------------
(You can fail this as many times as you like, and you'll still get the
points every time you meet Yuffie until you get her in your party)
    "All right"               --
    "Not interested"          (+2 Yuffie)

    "Petrified..."            (+2 Yuffie)
    "You're gonna lose again" --

    "Go ahead"                --
    "Wait a second!"          (+2 Yuffie)

    "That's right"            (+2 Yuffie)
    "You kiddin'?"            --

    "What's your name?"       --
    "Let's hurry"             (+2 Yuffie)



The Cargo Ship
--------------
On the Cargo Ship, if Yuffie asks you for Tranquilizers:
    "Here, use this" (+4 Yuffie)
    "Nope"           (-2 Yuffie)

When Aeris asks you about the Airship:
    "I'll take you someday" (+2 Aeris)
    "I dunno..."            (-2 Aeris)

When Tifa asks you about war:
    "Yeah..."      (+2 Tifa)
    "I don't know" (-2 Tifa)



Costa Del Sol
-------------
I'm *very* disappointed with Costa Del Sol; there are a lot of dialogue
options that you could choose, but none of them seem to alter 'Affection'
values at all; even the ones that seem to *really* annoy the girls.



Mt Corel
--------
Stealing the Phoenix Downs from the Cokatolis nest does nothing to alter
'Affection' values.  Neither does finding it but leaving it alone, for that
matter.  And no, it doesn't even matter who is in your party at the time.
Another wasted opportunity, in my opinion.



Gold Saucer
-----------
Depending on who you choose first to accompany you in the Gold Saucer:
    Aeris:    (+3 Aeris)
    Tifa:     (+3 Tifa)
    Yuffie:   (+3 Yuffie)
    Red XIII: --

Depending on who you choose first to accompany Barret to see Dyne:
    Aeris:    (+10 Aeris)
    Tifa:     (+3 Tifa)
    Yuffie:   (+2 Yuffie)
    Red XIII: --



Gongaga
-------
If, after either Aeris or Tifa (or both) meets Zack's parents then:
    Ignoring Aeris                  (-3 Aeris)
    Talking to Aeris                --
        "Poor guy"                  (+1 Aeris)
        "(...jealous...envious...)" (+2 Aeris)
    Ignoring Tifa                   (-3 Tifa)
    Talking to Tifa                 (+1 Tifa)
       (doesn't matter what
        you say to her)



Wutai
-----
After Yuffie gives back all your Materia in Wutai: (+10 Yuffie)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
MISC. NOTES
-----------
I have tested this thoroughly, and I am sure now; battles do not change
Affection values at all.  Using Cover or allowing a member of your party to
fall will not affect the date sequence, as previous guides may have
indicated.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
GUIDES TO DATING YUFFIE/BARRET
------------------------------
So, you picked up this guide to date Yuffie or Barret, and can't be bothered
trying to go through the above?  Well, in my opinion, that makes you a bit
lazy, but that's just my opinion.  In any case, what follows are two separate
guides; the first to date Yuffie, the second to date Barret.  Note the
differences by the way in what you have to do; it's really interesting....

Yuffie:
  1. Don't buy a flower from Aeris when you first see her in Sector 8.
  2. Talk to Jessie twice on the train home from Sector 8, and tell her
you're "Looking forward to it".
  3. Don't talk to Tifa while she's behind the bar.  If you do, decline her
offer for a drink.
  4. Say "...Sorry" when she asks you if you've forgotten your promise.
  5. Ignore Tifa the next morning; don't talk to her, and go straight to
Barret.
  6. Get caught by the Security Lockdown; do not reach the end of the train.
Force Barret and Tifa to jump out early this way.
  7. After defeating Airbuster, before Cloud falls, tell Barret to "Be
strong".
  8. When Aeris is fleeing the guards, climb up to the top level and tell her
to Wait each time.  Then, push the *wrong* barrel (so that she has to fight
the guard anyway).  Do this three times.
  9. When Aeris asks if Tifa is your girlfriend, say "Yeah, that's right."
  10.  When you get to the playground in Sector 6, tell Aeris that you'll
"Take her home."
  11. Get none of the best items so that Tifa is chosen for the Don's
date.  When you meet Aeris outside the Don's office, tell her "We gotta help
Tifa!"
  12. When everyone lands in the sewer, talk to Aeris first.
  13. When Marlene asks you how you feel about Aeris, tell her "I don't
know".
  14. When you first meet Red XIII, tell Tifa to take care of Aeris (keep
Barret in your party for *this* battle).
  15. After the battle with HO512, split up into a team of Cloud, Barret and
Red XIII.
  16. When Tifa asks if you can break out, tell her "(Kinda hard)"
  17. Think about Red XIII first, Barret second, and Aeris last while you're
in the cell.
  18. When you finally escape Midgar and have to choose your team, pick a
team with Cloud, Barret and Red XIII.
  19. In Kalm, after the flashback, tell Barret to "Wait a sec", then
"Is that all?"
  20. Make a party immediately afterwards with Cloud, Aeris and Tifa.  In a
house in Kalm, there's a woman who asks you about whether Mako energy is
convenient.  Tell her "Yeah, maybe".  Talk to the girl upstairs,
and when she asks you if the old life is better, say "No way".
  21. In Fort Condor, disagree twice to the old guy about his plight.  After
that, you can go into Fort Condor and agree then, but that's up to you.
  22. Find Yuffie in Junon Forest.  Get her into your party.  (Take as long
as you like, but this guide will assume you got her first time, and she
didn't run away....)
  23. On the Cargo Ship, give Yuffie a tranquilizer.  (Make sure you bought
one in Junon Town.)
  24. On the Cargo Ship, tell Aeris "I dunno..." when she asks about the
Airship.
  25. On the Cargo Ship, when Tifa asks you about war, say "I don't know".
  26. At the Gold Saucer, when you split up, talk to Yuffie first, and take
her with you (do not choose Aeris or Tifa).
  27. When you see Barret again in the Corel Prison, and you're about to go
after Dyne, you will be prompted to make a party.  Choose Cloud, Barret, and
Yuffie.
  28. Before entering Gongaga Town, make your party into Cloud, Aeris and
Tifa.  Then, when you meet Zack's parents, and Aeris and Tifa leave, ignore
*both* of them and leave town.
  29. Complete the Wutai subquest, and let Yuffie steal your Materia.  After
you get the Materia back, go straight to the Gold Saucer for the date
sequence.

Ending Affection Scores
  Yuffie: 37
  Aeris:  21
  Tifa:   16
  Barret: 0


Barret:
  1. Buy a flower from Aeris when you see her in Sector 8.
  2. Talk to Jessie twice on the train home from Sector 8, and tell her
you're "Looking forward to it".
  3. Give the flower to Marlene when you get the option.
  4. Don't talk to Tifa while she's behind the bar.  If you do, decline her
offer for a drink.
  5. Say "...Sorry" when she asks you if you've forgotten your promise.
  6. Say "Barret's snoring kept me up..." when she asks you how you slept the
next morning.
  7. Don't get caught by the Security Lockdown; get to the end of the train.
  8. After defeating Airbuster, before Cloud falls, tell Barret to "Be
strong".
  9. When Aeris is fleeing the guards, climb up to the top level and tell her
to Wait each time.  Then, push the *wrong* barrel (so that she has to fight
the guard anyway).  Do this three times.
  10. When Aeris asks if Tifa is your girlfriend, say "Yeah, that's right."
  11.  When you get to the playground in Sector 6, tell Aeris that you'll
"Take her home."
  12. Get *all* the best items so that Cloud is chosen for the Don's date
(not Tifa or Aeris).  Tell the Don that there's someone else, and when he
asks who, tell him "Yes, his name's Barret..."
  13. When everyone lands in the sewer, talk to Aeris first.
  14. When Marlene asks you how you feel about Aeris, tell her "I don't
know".
  15. When you first meet Red XIII, tell Barret to take care of Aeris (keep
Tifa in your party for *this* battle).
  16. After the battle with HO512, split up into a team of Cloud, Barret and
Red XIII.
  17. When Tifa asks if you can break out, tell her "(Kinda hard)"
  18. Think about Barret first, Red XIII second, and Aeris last while you're
in the cell.
  19. When you finally escape Midgar and have to choose your team, pick a
team with Cloud, Barret and Red XIII.
  20. In Kalm, after the flashback, tell Barret to "Wait a sec", then
"Beautiful, just beautiful!"
  21. Make a party immediately afterwards with Barret, Cloud and Red XIII.
In a house in Kalm, there's a woman who asks you about whether Mako energy
is convenient.  Tell her "You're full of it".  Talk to the girl upstairs,
and when she asks you if the old life is better, say "Yeah, maybe".
  22. In Fort Condor, agree twice to the old guy about his plight.
  23. You don't have to meet Yuffie; in fact, it's probably better if you
don't.  But you can if you want to.  Just make sure you get her the first
time, and don't make her run away.
  24. On the Cargo Ship, don't give Yuffie a tranquilizer.
  25. On the Cargo Ship, tell Aeris "I dunno..." when she asks about the
Airship.
  26. On the Cargo Ship, when Tifa asks you about war, say "I don't know".
  27. At the Gold Saucer, when you split up, talk to Red XIII first, and take
him with you (do not choose Aeris, Tifa or Yuffie).
  28. When you see Barret again in the Corel Prison, and you're about to go
after Dyne, you will be prompted to make a party.  Choose Cloud, Barret, and
either Red XIII or Cait Sith.  *DO NOT CHOOSE AERIS*!  She gets a heck of a
boost if she gets chosen, and will mess up everything you've worked for.
  29. Before entering Gongaga Town, make your party into Cloud, Aeris and
Tifa.  Then, when you meet Zack's parents, and Aeris and Tifa leave, ignore
*both* of them and leave town.
  30. Do not go anywhere near Wutai if you have Yuffie.  Instead, go straight
to the Gold Saucer for the date sequence.

Ending Affection Scores
  Barret: 47
  Aeris:  37
  Tifa:   35
  Yuffie: 14

There, that's it.  I would like to thank the makers of GameHack, without
which, I would never have been able to accomplish this task.  Also, heartfelt
thanks to those at alt.games.final-fantasy.rpg, who, as I write this, are
already going about seeing the Barret 'Date', testing this out.  I wish them
well.

Thanks for reading this, and I hope this document has helped you in some
small way.
