Welcome to the Game Mechanics FAQ of Final Fantasy XII(12). In this FAQ you  
will find many game mechanisms that are not mentioned by the game itself, or
the Official (Brady) Strategy Guide of FF12. Hopefully, this FAQ will help you
formulate more efficient strategies throughout the game, and make your FF12
experience more insightful and interesting.

Most of the information below is based on the Official (Square-Enix) Japanese
guide: Battle Ultimania (one of the Ultimania guides).

0. Important Notes

______________________________________________________________________________
==============================================================================

1: The game rounds down all decimals at the end of all calculations. For
   example, 99.99 = 99, not 100.

2: This game contains a lot of mechanics that are extremely repetitive,
   tedious and mind-degenerative in nature.

3: Don't forget to use Ctrl + F to search for your keywords.

4: Here is a list of abbreviated terms that I will use throughout the FAQ.

    =============================
   | ATK  | Attack (of a weapon) |
   |------|----------------------|
   | DEF  | Defense              |
   | MDEF | Magical Defense      |
   | EVA  | Evasion              |
   |------|----------------------|
   | STR  | Strength             |
   | MAG  | Magic Power          |
   | VIT  | Vitality             |
   | SPD  | Speed                |
   | Lv   | Level                |
   |------|----------------------|
   | DMG  | Damage               |
   |------|----------------------|
   | CT   | Charge Time Factor   |
   |------|----------------------|
   | acc. | Accessory            |
   | lic. | License              |
    =============================

5. We finally received some breakthrough information in the controller issue.
   See Appendix A for details.

6. If there is a conflict between this guide and another guide, it is likely
   that Ultimania is more accurate, unless I made a mistake in translation.

7. Thank you for reading!

______________________________________________________________________________
==============================================================================

1. Action Time

______________________________________________________________________________
==============================================================================

Let's start with the fundamental knowledge of battles - how each action takes
place. All actions in FF12 go through the following two stages: "Charge",
and "Action". The "Charge Stage" involves the filling of the charge bar. The
"Action Stage" refers to the actual action, which can be roughly broken down
into the "Animation" and "Stun" periods.

     1.Charge       2a.Animation   2b.Stun    Next Charge...
|---------------->|--------------|---------|------------------>

The total time required for any action is the simple sum of the three.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------
| "Total" Action Time  = Charge Time + Action Time                |
|                      = Charge Time + Animation Time + Stun Time |
 -----------------------------------------------------------------

In the following sections I will introduce them one by one.

______________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ 1a. Charge Stage ]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Charging is not a new concept in FFs. What's new this time is that different
actions require various length of Charge Time. There are quite a few factors
involved in the calculation of Charge Time:

 ---------------------------------------------------------------
| Charge Time = [CT x CS-MOD + RAN0.5] x L-MOD x B-MOD x ST-MOD |
 ---------------------------------------------------------------

 where      CT = Charge Time Factor (CT)
        CS-MOD = Character's Speed Modifier
        RAN0.5 = Random number between 0 and 0.5 (seconds)
         L-MOD = License "Swiftness" Modifier
         B-MOD = Battle Speed Modifier
        ST-MOD = Stats Modifier


o Charge Time Factor (CT)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All actions in FF12 come with its own Charge Time Factor(CT). Each type of
weapon comes with a standard CT, while some particular weapons have their own
unique CT. For example, the Wyrmhero blade comes with a very long CT of 99.

CT is almost directly proportional to the time required for the Charge Stage.
When all other parameters being equal (including the random number between 0
and 0.5 seconds), a weapon with 3 times more CT will require 3 times longer to
charge. CT = 0 means the action requires no charge at all.

Here come all CTs in the game:

* Better Daggers have shorter CT:
  Danjuro (21)
  Zwill Crossblade (22)
  Platinum Dagger, Orichalcum Dirk, Avenger (23)
  Gladius, Main Gauche, Chopper (24)
  Assassin's Dagger, Mage Masher, Dagger (25)

? So far, there has been no mentioning of CT for Unarmed. Based on the
  experimental data collected by Arthellinus (as in Power Walkthrough) and
  TimeMage (see 1c), the CT for Unarmed should be close to, or slightly lower
  than the CT of Spears, 26.


o Character's Speed Modifier (CS-MOD)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Character's Speed Modifier is solely influenced by, guess what, a character's
SPD stat. However, the relationship between the two is not very intuitive,
and quite surprising.

The Ultimania guide only supplied a graph of how a character's SPD relates to
the "basic time", which is defined as "CT x CS-MOD" in the context of this
FAQ. I have converted the graph to actual numbers below. The weapon used in
this graph is a CT=35 weapon.

 ================================
|   SPD |  CT x CS-MOD (seconds) |
|-------|------------------------|
|    23 |        ~4.75           |
| 24-25 |        ~4.65           |
| 26-28 |        ~4.55           |
| 29-31 |        ~4.45           |
| 32-35 |        ~4.35           |
| 36-40 |        ~4.25           |
| 41-46 |        ~4.15           |
| 47-56 |        ~4.05           |
| 57-72 |        ~3.95           |
| 73-93 |        ~3.85           |
| 94-99 |        ~3.75           |
 ================================

As you can see, the reduction of CT x CS-MOD is only obvious when SPD is
relatively low (below 46). The bonus becomes smaller and smaller as speed
increases.

Even for the extremes, the highest-possible SPD (99) only makes charging 21%
faster compared to the lowest-possible SPD (23) (relative CS-MOD = 0.79).
Contrary to public belief, SPD matters not very much in charge.


o License "Swiftness" Modifier (L-MOD)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each "Swiftness" License purchased results in a 12% reduction in the Swiftness
Modifier (L-MOD), up to a total of 3 licenses = 36% reduction in L-MOD.

So why is this different from the in-game description of "10%" reduction?

It is likely that the in-game description refers to the "Total Action Time",
which is the sum of "Charge Stage Time" and "Action Stage Time". Since the
Action Stage Time is not reduced by the Swiftness license, the "Total Action
Time" reduction is likely to be less than 12%. 10% is probably a good
estimation for the general public to comprehend.


o Battle Speed Modifier (B-MOD)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are 6 battle speeds one can choose from.

 =============================
| Battle Speed | B-MOD        |
|--------------|--------------|
| 1 (Slowest)  | 1/1.0 (100%) |
| 2            | 1/1.2  (83%) |
| 3            | 1/1.4  (71%) |
| 4            | 1/1.6  (63%) |
| 5            | 1/1.8  (56%) |
| 6 (Fastest)  | 1/2.0  (50%) |
 =============================

A fast Battle Speed (low B-MOD) reduces the Charge Stage Time, while keeping
the Action Stage Time the same. This means that by setting the battle speed
fast, you reduce the relative disadvantage of actions with long CTs (such as
guns), as the action stage length stays the same (see Section 1b).

On the other hand, when all you need to do is fleeing, setting the battle
speed to minimum prevents more enemies from finishing their charges and
attacking your happy-feet (fleeing) character.


o Status Modifier (ST-MOD)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are various statuses that make a character charge faster, slower, or not
charge at all. These statuses can stack upon each other by multiplication,
except in the case of Slow + Haste.

 =======================================
| Status                 | ST-MOD       |
|------------------------|--------------|
| Berserk                | 1/2.0  (50%) |
| Haste                  | 1/1.5  (67%) |
| Slow                   | 1/0.5 (200%) |
|------------------------|--------------|
| Berserk + Haste        | 1/3.0  (33%) |
| Berserk + Haste + Slow | 1/2.0  (50%) |
| Berserk + Slow         | 1/1.0 (100%) |
| Haste + Slow*          | 1/1.0 (100%) |
|------------------------|--------------|
| Sleep                  | Paused       |
| Stop                   | Paused       |
 =======================================

* In normal circumstances, Slow and Haste would "replace" each other, but when
  you get Slowed while equipping with the Hermes Sandals accessory, the two
  effects cancel each other.

It is obvious that status (berserk and haste) has far more influence on the
character's charge time than the character's SPD has. Therefore, it is
very beneficial to keep key damage dealer buffed at least with Berserk.

______________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1b. Action Stage]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Charge Stage is followed by the Action Stage, where a command is finally
executed. As mentioned earlier, this stage can be roughly broken down into the
"Animation" period and the "Stun" period.

Each action has its own animation with a fixed length. After the animation,
sometimes you would notice that the character does nothing for a few seconds,
and this is the stun period.

In some actions (such as using an item), the animation is very short, but the
stun is relatively long. In some other cases (such as regular attacks) the
stun almost does not exist compared to its lengthy charge.

The Ultimania guide does not differentiate between animation and stun, and
simply combines them into the "Action Time".

 ========================================
| Action Type    | Action Time (seconds) |
|----------------|-----------------------|
| Melee Attacks  |         1.2           |
|    if Blocked  |        +0.2           |
|      if Combo  |        +0.5 each      |
|                |     or +0.9 each      | <- Rare
|----------------|-----------------------|
| Ranged Attacks |         1.4           |
|    *exceptions |         1.6           |
|----------------|-----------------------|
| Magics &       |       3 ~ 5           |
| Techniques     |                       |
 ========================================

There are a few exceptions where ranged attacks will take longer (1.6s) to
execute than normal range attacks (1.4s). These exceptions are:

1. Balthier with Bow, Crossbow, Gun
2. Fran with Bow
3. Penelo with Crossbow, Gun

Surprisingly, it takes Balthier and Fran "longer" to use their favorite
weapons!

By the way, if the game config is set on "Wait", then only ONE action can be
executed at any time. If the game config is set on "Active", then multiple
actions can be executed at the same time. This explains why some magics with
long animation will put the other actions on hold to a noticeable level.

Note: While a long magic animation is being played, it seems that no other
magic can be casted before the long animation is over, even under the ACTIVE
mode. However, regular attacks / combos can be executed during a magic
animation.

The very long Action Time of magics and techniques make them less desirable
in fast-paced, especially active-time combats. Generally speaking, while
having all magics and weapons available to choose from, regular melee attacks
are more effective exactly because of this -- regular attacks get much shorter
Action Times.

o Delaying Monster's Action with Long Animation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If a monster's deadly move requires a certain animation (even a cutscene), you
can initiate some long-animation actions to put it on hold, while your melee
actors hack away freely during the long animation.

[1c. Users' Data]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now the mechanics are given to you, but it is still hard to grasp how they
actually convert to real time. Fortunately, two very professional in-game
swinging and timing experiments have been conducted, by Arthellinus and
TimeMage.

Arthellinus' (A) Data (source: Power Walkthrough):

Character: SPD = 35, 3 Swiftness Licenses
Battle Speed: Slowest
Timer Starts at: Charging
Timer Stops at: Damage Pops

TimeMage's (T) Data:

Character: Vaan Lv = 53, SPD = 31, 3 Swiftness Licenses
Battle Speed: Slowest
Timer Starts at: Charging
Timer Stops at: next Charging
Each test is averaged in 3 sets of 10 swings.

Basically, Arthellinus' data contains Charge and Animation,, while TimeMage's
Data contains additional Stun, a.k.a. the "Total Action".

                                               Damage Pops
                                               ^

| Dagger - Z.C. | 22 | 2.17 |      |

| Gun           | 51 | 4.43 | 5.65 |
 ==================================

Some of the toughest bosses in the game actually have 0 CT for their attacks,
so their Action Time is the only restriction on their attack speed. To make
these fights a little easier for us, we can adjust the battle speed to the
fastest. This way, our characters also execute their actions with short Charge
Stages.

Putting the game on Active will make the boss attack non-stop, but our
characters can also act without having to wait boss's attack is over. This may
also be beneficial, if you have a good set of Gambits.

2. Weapons

______________________________________________________________________________
FF12: The Attack, Attack, and Attack of the Character Clones (Frioniel2006) ==

In this section, I will cover the general mechanics of weapons, such as their
damage formula and combo / critical hit rate. Based on these data I will make
some recommendations at the end.

______________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2a. Damage Formula]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All weapons, except guns, deal damage depending on the character's stats. Some  
weapons depend on strength (STR) only, while some depend on strength and
a secondary stat, such as magic power (MAG), vitality (VIT), or speed (SPD). 

In terms of damage calculation formula, there are 8 categories of weapons in  
FF12. 

 = A1: Unarmed ==============================================================
|                                                                            |
| DMG = [11 x RANDOM(1~1.125) - DEF] x STR x (Lv+STR)/256                    |
|                                                                            |
 ============================================================================

After learning the license "Brawler", or equipping the accessory "Amber
Armlet" (enhanced unarmed damage), the formula becomes:

 = A2: Unarmed (with Brawler License) =======================================
|                                                                            |
| DMG = [(Lv+STR)/2 x RANDOM(1~1.125) - DEF] x STR x (Lv+STR)/256            |
|                                                                            |
 ============================================================================

Essentially, the ATK modifier changes from 11 to the average of Lv and STR
with the Brawler license.

Generally speaking, if you can find a weapon that has an ATK higher than your
STR and Lv average, then better use the weapon.

 = B: Swords (1H & 2H), Spears, Crossbows, Rods =============================
|                                                                            |
| DMG = [ATK x RANDOM(1~1.125) - DEF] x [1 + STR x (Lv+STR)/256]             |
|                                                                            |
 ============================================================================

Different from unarmed, all actual weapons have a basic damage of "1" in
front of the STR and Lv modifiers, which gives you a good bonus during
low levels.

1-H swords, 2-H swords, spears, crossbows and rods are all strength-dependent  
weapons. There are two rods that do not apply to this formula: the Rod of
Faith and the Healing Rod (see H. Guns).

 = C: Poles =================================================================
|                                                                            |
| DMG = [ATK x RANDOM(1~1.125) - MDEF] x [1 + STR x (Lv+STR)/256]            |
|                                                                            |
 ============================================================================

The only difference between poles and other strength-based weapons is that  
poles check against magical defense, instead of physical defense.

 = D: Maces =================================================================
|                                                                            |
| DMG = [ATK x RANDOM(1~1.125) - DEF] x [1 + MAG x (Lv+MAG)/256]             |
|                                                                            |
 ============================================================================

Maces are the only completely MAG-dependent weapons.

 = E: Katanas, Staves =======================================================
|                                                                            |
| DMG = [ATK x RANDOM(1~1.125) - DEF] x [1 + STR x (Lv+MAG)/256]             |
|                                                                            |
 ============================================================================

Katanas and Staves depend on both STR and MAG. The higher the character level,
the more weight is put on STR, and less on MAG, though.

 = F: Axes, Hammers, Handbombs ==============================================
|                                                                            |
| DMG = [ATK x RANDOM(0~1.111) - DEF] x [1 + STR x (Lv+VIT)/128]             |
|                                                                            |
 ============================================================================

Axes, hammers and handbombs offer very unstable damages. This is because that
the random number modifier of ATK starts from 0, not 1. However, the bonus
modifier is divided by 128, not 256. So these unstable weapon's average damage
output is still on-par with the other weapons. Note that both STR and VIT are
checked while using these weapons.

 = G: Daggers, Ninja Swords, Bows ===========================================
|                                                                            |
| DMG = [ATK x RANDOM(1~1.125)]- DEF] x [1 + STR x (Lv+SPD)/218]             |
|                                                                            |
 ============================================================================

Daggers, ninja swords and bows depend on both STR and SPD. Probably since SPD  
is usually significantly lower than other three stats later in the game, the  
bonus modifier is divided by 218, instead of 256. Since SPD grows slowly,
during low levels this category offers quite a distinctive edge in DMG.

 = H: Guns, Measures ========================================================
|                                                                            |
| DMG = [ATK x RANDOM(1~1.125)]^2 *                                          |
|                                                                            |
 ============================================================================

Guns and measures are unique weapons that deal damage solely based on its  
ATK rating, regardless of character's power and the target's physical or  
magical defense.

Based on some sources, the random numbers applied for guns and measures is
0~1.125, not 1~1.125. However, from my experiences guns never deal very  
little damage (except against the monsters with gun / measure resistance, see
section 8a), so I am inclined to think this is a typo and it should be
1~1.125.

There are certain modifiers that are added on top of the base damage, wherever
applicable:

 ============================================================
| Modifier               |  Damage Dealt   | Damage Received | 
|------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Critical Hit           |     x 2         |                 |
| Berserk                |     x 1.5       |                 |
| Bravery                |     x 1.3       |                 |
|------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Petrify                | 0.1 x Time Left | 0.1 x Time Left |
| Oil                    |                 |      x 3 (Fire) |
| Sleep                  |                 |      x 1.5      |
| Protect                |                 |      x 0.75     |
|------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| HP Full ATK Up license |     x 1.2       |                 |
| HP Crit. ATK Up lic.   |     x 2         |                 |
| HP Crit. DEF Up lic.   |                 |      x 0.5*     |
|------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Weapon's Element Bonus |     x 1.5       |                 |**
| Elemental Weak         |                 |      x 2        |
| Elemental 1/2          |                 |      x 0.5      |
| Elemental Null         |                 |      x 0        |
| Elemental Absorb       |                 | Heals, x 1 or 2 |
 ============================================================

Note: The above modifiers are accumulative, and stack up by multiplication.

* If the monster has this ability, their received damage is reduced to 1/3,
not 1/2.

** Weapon's Element Bonus is quite a special concept in FF12. Basically, when
a character equips a weapon that has a element "bonus", all damages associated
with this particular element is boosted by 50%, both physical and magical.

Note that this Bonus is independent of the weapon's own Element. The bonus
can usually exist on its own, and a weapon with an element usually does not
have a elemental bonus. For example, all of the staves that have the BONUS
does NOT have an element on themselves. The dagger Gladius has an element of
Wind, but it does not have an elemental "bonus" on its wind element, so the
additional 50% DMG does not apply.

Unfortunately, the game's short description on weapons completely omits this
element bonus information, so you won't see it until you actually own this
weapon.

There are a lot of weapons that have an element, but only 11 weapons and 2
armors that come with an elemental "bonus". Here is a complete list of them:

 =====================================================
| Weapon Type  | Name            | "Bonus"  | Element |
|--------------|-----------------|----------|---------|
| Pole         | Six-fluted Pole |  Water   |         |
|--------------|-----------------|----------|---------|
| Rod          | Holy Rod        |  Holy    |  Holy   |
|--------------|-----------------|----------|---------|
| Bow          | Burning Bow     |  Fire    |         |
|--------------|-----------------|----------|---------|
| Mace         | Zeus Mace       |  Dark    |         |
|--------------|-----------------|----------|---------|
| Staff        | Cherry Staff    |  Wind    |         |
|              | Flame Staff     |  Fire    |         |
|              | Storm Staff     |  Thunder |         |
|              | Glacial Staff   |  Ice     |         |
|              | Cloud Staff     |  Water   |         |
|              | Staff of Magi   |  Holy    |         |
|--------------|-----------------|----------|---------|
| Handbomb     | Fumarole        |  Water   |         |
|==============|=================|==========|=========|
| Armor        | White Robe      |  Holy    |         |
|              | Black Robe      |  Dark    |         |
 =====================================================

When you use the above weapons to do physical attack, the weapon's own
element will be checked. For example, when you use a Six-fluted Pole to
do physical attack, there won't be a 50% DMG bonus because the weapon
actually has no element. You will get the bonus when you actually do a water-
related attack, such as casting the Water spell.

However, if you swing a holy rod, its holy element will be strengthened by its
own holy Bonus, so all of your attacks (holy element) will be 50% more
powerful automatically. Nice, right? Too bad this weapon has a low ATK (53).

Interestingly, two armors also supply an element bonus that's pretty obvious
given their names. For example, if your Yagyu Darkblade (Dark element) user
wears the Black Robe (Bonus on Dark), you will get an additional 50% DMG bonus
against Yiazmat (weakness to Dark), dealing 300% DMG!

By the way, the same Elemental Bonus does not stack, according to Master ZED,
who tested Zeu's Mace + Black Robe.

Thanks to Eric Yuen, who performed some test with the Burning Bow and Fiery
Arrow, we now have some live example of how things actually work.

 Location 3: Lushu Mine, Headless that absorbs fire:
 =======================================================================
|                     Arrow | Fiery Arrow (ATK 1) | Onion Arrow (ATK 1) |
| Bow                       | Element Fire        | Element None        |
|---------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Burning Bow (ATK 63)      |     ~ 1500 Heal     |     ~ 500 DMG       |
| Bonus Fire, Element None  |    (-300% Bonus)    |                     |
|---------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Yoichi Bow (ATK 75)       |     ~ 1300 Heal     |    ~  700 DMG       |
| Bonus None, Element None  |    (-200% Bonus)    |                     |
 =======================================================================

In the last case, Burning Bow gives the monster an extra 50% of the healing
amount (200% x 1.5 = 300%). It is unexpected that the monster actually gets
200% of heal from the fiery arrow alone (with Yoichi Bow). However, it seems
that when our own characters are healed by absorbing a particular spell
element, we are only healed for 100% of the damage.

Therefore, we know that some monsters happen to have the same weakness and
absorb element (such as the Headless in the above case), doubling its healing
amount.

[2b. Hit Combo and Critical Hit]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each type of weapon comes with a "Hit Combo / Critical Hit" rate, and a few
weapons have their own unique hit combo / critical hit rate. Hit combos and
critical hit cannot co-exist on the same weapon.

Note: When the accessory "Genji Gloves" is equipped as accessory, the values
      below are multiplied by 1.8. Without Genji Gloves, the values are
      multiplied by 0.7.

 ============================================================

 ============================================================

The above numbers are only about hit combos, so they have nothing to do with
the actual "number" of hits. When character's HP gets low, the chance of combo
stays the same, but the number of combo increases. Thanks to Red Star, who
provided these data from Ultimania:

 ========================================================================

 ========================================================================

As you can see, the number of hits rises drastically when the character's HP
falls from low to... very low. It is possible to purposely lower a character's
HP to < 6.25% before hand, along with a high-combo weapon (such as Masamune)
and Genji Gloves, to open a battle with a long chain of combos to finish the
enemy right there!

Of course, the combo stops when the enemy is dead.

By the way, Esper's regular attack never combos / critical hits.

______________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2c. Blocking and Parry]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is quite a lot of confusion on the evasion issue. First, please
understand that evasion (blocking & parry) has NOTHING to do with stats. They
are all about your equipments and monsters' abilities.

In FF12, each attack goes through the following checks:

1-------------------------------------------   if evaded
| Shield Evasion Chance / Attack Hit Chance | -----------> Block
 -------------------------------------------
                  | if not evaded
2-------------------------------------------   if evaded
| Weapon Evasion Chance / Attack Hit Chance | -----------> Block
 -------------------------------------------
                  | if not evaded
3-------------------------------------------   if evaded
|      Parry Chance / Attack Hit Chance     | -----------> Parry
 -------------------------------------------
                  | if not evaded
4-------------------------------------------   if evaded
|              Other Conditions             | ------------> Miss
 -------------------------------------------
                  | if not evaded
 -------------------------------------------
|                H I T !!                   |
 -------------------------------------------

If the shield block fails, then the system checks for the weapon block. If
that still fails, the system then check for parry, and so on.

o Shield Evasion
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All shields come with their physical and magical evasion rate, This evasion
rate is the percentage of time that this shield can block off a physical or
magical attack.

On the license board, each Shield Block = 5% bonus on the shield evasion.

The accessory Gauntlets provides an additional 10% bonus.

If a shield offers both physical and magical evasion, then the same bonus
is also applied to both physical and magical evasion.

o Weapon Evasion
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All weapons come with their unique evasion rate. For example, Main Gauche
offers the best 1-H weapon evasion of 34%. It functions exactly like the
shield evasion, while blocking away only physical attacks.

In the game's stat page, weapon's EVA is added to the shield EVA, while in
reality they happen only after the shield evasion fails.

Therefore, even if you equip Main Gauche (+34), with the best shield (+50),
gauntlets (+10) and all three shield block license (+15), you do not get
109% (34+50+10+15) of the blocking rate, but instead you only get:
(50+10+15)% + [100-(50+10+15)]% x 34% = 83.5% of blocks.

In other words, the only way to achieve 100% blocking is through the +90
shield, but you probably won't like its negative effects. Also, quite a few
late bosses have an ability to ignore blocking and parry completely, so you
don't even have to bother carrying a shield.

o Parry
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our characters do not parry by default. It only happens when the accessory
"Jade Collar" is equipped. Jade Collar provides 30% parry.

If you miss a certain enemy frequently from parry, this enemy probably has a
special ability that is roughly equivalent to the effect of the "Jade Collar"
acc., except in the monster's case the bonus is 25% to evasion.

You can counter this annoying ability by equipping the accessory "Cameo Belt",
which completely ignores the effect of Block and Parry. Actually, tough bosses
also have this inborn ability to ignore your Block and Parry as well, like
wearing a Cameo Belt on themselves. (They also wear a lot of rings and
wristlets, see section 8a for more.)


o Other Conditions (Thanks to Red Star)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- When the character is blind, all accuracy is halved (x0.5).

- Weather affects the accuracy of Bows and Crossbows. When the weather is
  Windy (Sunny/Cloudy/Rain, does not matter), Heavy Rain, (Heavy) Snow and
  Sandstorm, accuracy modifier for bows is x0.8 and for crossbows is x0.5.

Now you know why your bow works poorly during the Giza Plain rain.

By the way,

- Crossbows cannot be parried.

- Guns, Measures, Healing Rod and Rod of Faith cannot be blocked or parried,
  but they can still miss (shooter is blinded, for example).

- No evasion takes place when you are fleeing (R2).

______________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2d. Counter]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Counter occurs ONLY when the accessory Battle Harness is equipped. It triggers
with the following chance: 

 ------------------------------
| Counter Chance (%) = SPD / 2 |
 ------------------------------

However, when you equip the acc. Battle Harness PLUS the Armor "Genji Armor",
the counter chance becomes:

 ------------------------------
| Counter Chance (%) = SPD x 2 |
 ------------------------------

Equipping the Genji Armor without the Battle Harness acc. will not give any
counter chance.

Thanks to Sheperds, who did some extensive studies on the Counter mechanics,
we have a lot more detailed information to supply here:

- Counter only triggers when the character:
  (1) is in the Charge Stage
  (2) is NOT running or walking (by pressing the L-stick on the controller)
  (3) is NOT being knocked back
  (4) receives a "regular melee" attack (NOT ranged, tech or spells).

- Counter is 1-hit only. It does not combo.

- Any weapon can be used to counter.

- Counter may happen each time while being hit. A hit combo may be countered
  multiple times.

- Counter may happen even if the attack missed / is evaded.

- Counter acts like regular melee attacks. Added effect on the weapon may
  trigger.

In Sheperds' conclusion, Counter is not as good as it seems to be, as it also
delays your charging action. Therefore, you only save a little Charge Time,
while sacrificing a valuable Accessory and Armor slot.

______________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2e. Knock Back]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From time to time you see a monster, or your own characters, getting knocked
back by an attack. The chance for knock back is:

 --------------------------------------------------------------------
| Knock Back Chance (%) =                                            |
| Weapon's Knock Back (KB) + RANDOM(0 ~ A's Lv) - RANDOM(0 ~ D's Lv) |
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 where A = Attacker
       D = Defender

Here is a table for all the Knock Back ratings for different types of weapons:

 =======================================================
| Name         | KB | Name        | KB | Name      | KB |
|--------------|----|-------------|----|-----------|----|
| Dagger       |  0 | Ninja Sword |  0 | Crossbow  |  0 |
| Mace         |  0 | Katana      |  0 | Handbomb  |  0 |
| Measure      |  0 | Spear       | 10 | Bow       |  0 |
| 1-Hand Sword | 10 | 2-H Sword   | 10*| Gun       | 10 |
| Axe          | 10 | Pole        | 10 |           |    |
| Hammer       | 10 | Rod         | 10 |           |    |
|              |    | Staff       | 10 |           |    |
 =======================================================

* Exception: Sword of the Kings, Treaty Blade (KB = 0)

When you happen to kill an enemy during a knock back, the target is knocked
extra far away with a special animation (such as spinning in the air).

You can see section 8a for a list of creature types that are immune to knock
back. Generally speaking, knock back only occurs to weak enemies and yourself,
and is therefore a completely worthless factor while choosing your weapon.

______________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2f. Added Effect]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other than elements (which are obvious), certain weapons offer an added effect
that is usually equivalent to a status spell, such as "K.O." in Deathbringer.
The added spell triggers at a specific rate, and once it triggers, the target
either gets it, or is immune from it.

Therefore, these weapon spells work differently from regular status magics,
the success rate of which depends on caster's MAG and target's VIT (see
section 3b).

Here is a list of all weapons that come with an added effect:

 =========================================================
| Category  | Weapon Name       | Added Effect     | Rate |

[2g. Recommendations]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Certainly, a few weapons are better than the others. The consensus of the most
useful weapons are:

1. Main Gauche (dagger, best defensive weapon, Weapon Blocking +34)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Surprise! The most used weapon in FF12 (at least in my game) is "Main Gauche".
I use it more often than any other weapon until almost the very end. Having
the highest evasion rating among all 1-H weapons, Main Gauche blocks away 1/3
of the physical attacks that penetrates our shield evasion, making it the best
weapon for the Leader / Tank / Thief in my usual party. This character is
usually busy stealing, so attack power never matters.

If you ever get a Main Gauche from a chest, keep it in your inventory.

Note: The Brady guide is not (entirely) correct about getting this dagger in
      a chest as early as the Western Waterway. See section 5b.


2. Zodiac Spear (best spear, ATK +150, Combo 4%)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are plenty of guides discussing how to get Zodiac spear early (as soon
as you obtain the first Esper). If you do get it early, this spear will be
soooo powerful that it actually makes 50% of the game boring. Personally I
think this game is not engaging enough anyways, so it is probably not a good
idea to make it even less interesting.

Zodiac Spear has the highest ATK value among all weapons. It has a lower combo
rate, but spears are about 10% faster than 2-H swords (see section 1a) in
terms of CT.

STR is the primary and secondary stat for spears. Therefore, Basch and Vaan
are the best spear users.


3. Fomalhaut (best gun, ATK +50, bullets extra)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Although its power output is not very high after you advance in levels, the
best gun Fomalhaut can be obtained rather early (the Antlion Hunt). Since gun
damage is independent of characters' stats and target's defense, this gun
could be more effective than any other great weapon in certain situations.
Plus, it is THE solution for flying monsters for a long while. The silent
bullet and a few other elemental bullets are very useful throughout the game,
too.

You can simply throw this gun to your weakest attacker, since its damage
remains the same.

The only alternative long-ranged weapon that you might consider getting is
the Sagittarius bow (best bow). Its damage will eventually surpass Fomalhaut
when your character reaches high levels, but the ingredients involve a little
farming. Do a keyword search in section 8c for details.


4. Masamune (best Katana, ATK +93, Combo 40%)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Suffering from a mediocre ATK rating, Masamune has the highest combo rate
among all "useful" weapons. (The Wyrmhero Blade is not useful, because you
only get it after you defeat the toughest bosses.) However, Masamune
becomes a progressively more powerful weapon for high levels, since you will
usually waste the extra attack power from high-ATK weapons on the damage cap
9999.

The primary and secondary stats for Katana are STR and MAG. Therefore, the
best wielder of this weapon is Vaan and Ashe.


5. Tournesol (1st/2nd best 2-H Sword, ATK +140, Combo 12%)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Although its ATK rating is slightly lower than Zodiac Spear, this 2-H sword
makes it up with a 12% Combo Rate (still low compared to Katana and Ninja
Swords, though). At higher levels, both Zodiac Spear and Tournesol give you
9999 damage each hit, so having a higher Combo Rate makes it a better weapon.

However, you can't get this sword very early, and you have to farm a lot of
rare items in order to buy this sword from Bazaar. Some people claim that they
spent more than 10 hours just to get this single weapon, but it is not much
better than alternatives. Do a keyword search in section 8c for details.

STR is the primary and secondary stat for 2-H swords, so Basch and Vaan are
the best users of them.


6. Excalibur (3rd best 2-H Sword, ATK + 128, Holy Element)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The holy element that comes with Excalibur makes it very useful in many tough
end-game optional dungeons, where most enemies are weak against Holy element.


7. Yagyu Darkblade (best Ninja Sword, ATK +80, Dark Element)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This sword is totally useless except against one tough SOB (who is weak
against Dark) -- and it will probably save you more time in the end, if you
are willing to invest about 30 minutes (or if unlucky, 2 hours) to get it
dropped from Bombshell.

STR and SPD are the primary and secondary stat for ninja swords. Since
characters have more or less the same SPD, you can just look at STR while
deciding who to use this weapon.


[Additional tips]

1) Give your main fighter Berserk + Haste + Bravery (set Gambits to save your
   time.) Their effects stack by multiplication, so you are looking at 195%
   damage, and 300% charge speed!

2) Genji Gloves (to be stolen from the last stage of your first Gilgamesh
   encounter) makes combo much easier. It boosts the combo chance by 257%!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2h. Best Weapon Comparison]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Naturally, you would wonder which weapon is really "the best out of the best".
Well, the official answer is simple: it depends! For monsters with high
defense, you should always aim for high-ATK weapons such as the Zodiac Spear
and the Tournesol. Otherwise, the high-combo Masamune is probably better.

Genji Gloves help a lot for high-combo weapons, as they boost the combo rate
proportional to its original value. So the more combo a weapon does, the more
bonus it receives from this accessory.

However, the Bubble Belt is probably the better accessory than Genji Gloves
for the toughest fights of the game, or else your characters probably won't
even get a chance to attack.

Anyways, let us pull out the calculator and let the numbers decide which is
the best weapon out of the best. First, we wish to simplify the settings a
bit. Let's take a Lv 99 Vaan (STR 77, MAG 64, VIT 61, SPD 37) for an example,
since Vaan is the best overall character in stat. (I know it doesn't make
any sense for a nobody kid to be this good, oh well.) Let's also give him the
best equipment customized for each weapon.

Now, let's define damage output as this:

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Damage Output =                                                            |
| Total Expected Damage per attack / each unit of CT required                |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please see section 1a for weapon's CT (charge time factor). CT is probably
not the best indicator of a weapon's true speed (as we are ignoring the
Action Time completely), though.

The Total Expected Damage is defined as:

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Total Expected Damage =                                                    |
| Expected DMG x (1 + Combo Rate x Ave. Number of Combo Hits)                |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This way, we take into account the combos on top of the first hit. Note that
each combo hit takes about 0.5 seconds to execute (Section 1b) and the time
is not paused during a combo. By ignoring this we are overestimating the
higher-combo weapon's damage output, and the omission becomes more serious in
a faster battle speed setting.

Now, since the average number of combo hits also varies according to the
characters' HP, we will assume the average combo hit is 2.873. This is the
average number of combo hits when a character's HP is > 25%, which happens
most of the time.

Let's forget about weapon evasion for now, as the toughest bosses have an
inborn ability to always hit our Lv 99 Vaan. I will also ignore the licenses
of HP full / critical Attack Up to simplify things.

While choosing equipment I will ignore the SPD consideration (which is not
significant), and just going for the MAX STR or whatever stat that matters. 

However, to be fair on weapons' specialties, we must take into account enemy's
defense (DEF), so the final result will be a table of numbers, instead of just
one number.

Let's have an example here:

Weapon: Zodiac Spear
   ATK: 150
   Combo Rate: 4% x 0.7 / 1.8 (without and with Genji Gloves, I'll do both.)
   CT: 26

Equipment (STR optimized): +24 STR (Grand Helm + Grand Armor)
With 5 Battle Lore Licenses: +5 STR
Final STR for Lv 99 Vaan: 77 + 24 + 5 = 106 (Oh Oh!)

It is now confirmed that the game caps stats at 99, so the extra strength
would be wasted.

Expected DMG = [(150x(1+1.125)/2-DEF] x [1+99x(99+99)/256]

Then, considering the damage cap, for all damages > 9999, we have to crop it
at 9999. Note that some bosses reduce damage when their HP gets low (DMG x 1/3),
so sometimes >>9999 damage will be reduced below the 9999 cap, which is not
wasted! However, for the sake of simplicity, let's just say they all cap at
9999 and discard the overflow.

Finally, let's factor in the combo rate, with Genji gloves and without. 

The total expected DMG = Expected DMG x (1 + 0.04x0.7x2.873)

Lastly, we divide this number by its CT (26) to get the Damage Output.

The final result looks like this (GG = Genji Gloves):

 ================================================
| Enemy's DEF | Output(no GG) | Output(with GG) | 
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
|      0      |    415.51     |      464.13     |
|      5      |    415.51     |      464.13     |
|     10      |    415.51     |      464.13     |
|     15      |    415.51     |      464.13     |
|     20      |    415.51     |      464.13     |
|     25      |    415.51     |      464.13     |
|     30      |    415.51     |      464.13     |
|     32      |    410.59     |      458.63     | Hell Wyrm
|     34      |    404.14     |      451.43     | Zodiark
|     36      |    397.70     |      444.23     | Yiazmat
|     38      |    391.25     |      437.03     | Omega MKXII
|     48      |    359.01     |      401.02     | Entites
 ===============================================

Let's now do the same calculation for all candidates, with and without Genji
Gloves.

 (1) Zodiac Spear
 (2) Masamune
 (3) Tournesol
 (4) Yagyu Darkblade (Yiazmat only)

Note: For Masamune and Yagyu Darkblade, I optimized the equipment so the
      damage is maximized (Magepower Shishak + Lordly Robe, Grand Helm +
      Maximilian, respectively). Also, since Yiazmat (DEF = 36) is weak
      against Dark element, Yagyu Darkblade's power is magnified to 200% in
      this particular case. (The Darkblade does NOT have a Dark Element
      "Bonus", so the damage is only boost to 200%. However, if you wear
      the Black Robe then it is 300%!)

Now let's take a look at the final results!

Without Genji Gloves, Outputs:

 ===========================================================
| Enemy's DEF | Zodiac S.| Masamune | Tournesol | Yagyu DB. |
|-------------|----------|----------|-----------|-----------|
|      0      |  415.51  |  500.40  |  413.74   |           |
|      5      |  415.51  |  475.08  |  413.74   |           |
|     10      |  415.51  |  449.76  |  413.74   |           |
|     15      |  415.51  |  424.44  |  413.74   |           |
|     20      |  415.51  |  399.12  |  413.25   |           |
|     25      |  415.51  |  373.80  |  397.20   |           |
|     30      |  415.51  |  348.48  |  381.15   |           |
|     32      |  410.59  |  338.25  |  374.73   |           | Hell Wyrm
|     34      |  404.14  |  328.22  |  368.31   |           | Zodiark
|     36      |  397.70  |  318.09  |  361.89   |  527.40   | Yiazmat
|     38      |  391.25  |  307.96  |  355.47   |           | Omega MKXII
|     48      |  359.01  |  257.32  |  323.38   |           | Entites
 ===========================================================

Starting at DEF 20, Masamune loses its lead because of its low ATK. If you
have to use a bubble belt (as in the toughest boss fights, you probably
cannot survive long without it), then Zodiac spear and Tournesol is
definitely better. Yagyu Darkblade is very powerful against Yiazmat, the
infamous 50,000,000 HP Mark No. 45. Therefore, while fighting bosses where
you may not be able to afford Genji Gloves, you can pretty much forget
about Masamune as well.

Now let's look at these weapons with Genji Gloves:

 ===========================================================
| Enemy's DEF | Zodiac S.| Masamune | Tournesol | Yagyu DB. |
|-------------|----------|----------|-----------|-----------|
|      0      |  464.13  |  850.96  |  540.14   |           |
|      5      |  464.13  |  807.90  |  540.14   |           |
|     10      |  464.13  |  764.84  |  540.14   |           |
|     15      |  464.13  |  721.78  |  540.14   |           |
|     20      |  464.13  |  678.72  |  539.50   |           |
|     25      |  464.13  |  635.66  |  518.55   |           |
|     30      |  464.13  |  592.61  |  497.59   |           |
|     32      |  458.63  |  575.38  |  489.21   |           | Hell Wyrm
|     34      |  451.43  |  558.16  |  480.83   |           | Zodiark
|     36      |  444.23  |  540.93  |  472.45   |  781.61   | Yiazmat
|     38      |  437.03  |  523.71  |  464.07   |           | Omega MKXII
|     48      |  401.02  |  437.59  |  422.17   |           | Entites
 ===========================================================

With Genji Gloves, the damage output is much better for Masamune, as it
benefits the most from Genji Gloves. Tournesol also gets significantly better
than the Zodiac Spear, but still falls behind Masamune. In reality, since
your main damage dealer is likely to be berserk or wearing the bravery
suit, it is even better to use the Masamune as it usually cannot reach the
damage cap compared to the other heavy hitters.

The other awesome weapon that I didn't mention here is Excalibur (2-H Sword,
ATK +128). Since it has a Holy element, naturally it is THE weapon to fight
enemies weak against Holy, where its damage DOUBLES -- end of consideration.

While the time is not too tough, you can probably put the Genji Gloves on your
Masamune / Yagyu DB. user, and put the belt on the other two characters, and
try not to let the enemy to kill your Masamune wielder. Along with Berserk,
Bravery and Haste, you can really push the Katana's damage towards the 9999
cap, and therefore get the best out of your high combos.

3. Magics & Items

______________________________________________________________________________
==============================================================================

In this section I will cover the mechanics behind magics and items. White and
Black magics are like weapons, in a sense, that they come with a certain power
value that is applied similarly to the ATK values in weapons. We will start
with them.

______________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[3a. Hurt & Heal Magics]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is a summary of all Hurt (usually black magics) and Heal (the cure series
white magics) power of the magics.

 ==================================================
| Name     | POW | Name     | POW | Name     | POW |

| Thunder  |  25 | Thundara |  70 | Thundaga | 124 |
| Water    |  37 |          |     |          |     |
| Dark     |  46 | Darkra   |  91 | Darkga   | 130 |
| Aero     |  52 | Aeroga   | 103 |          |     |

| Holy     | 157 |          |     |          |     |
| Flare    | 163 |          |     |          |     |
| Ardor    | 175 |          |     |          |     |
| Scathe   | 190 |          |     |          |     |
|----------|-----|----------|-----|----------|-----|
| Cure     |  20 | Cura     |  45 |          |     |
| Curaga   |  85 | Curaja   | 145 |          |     |
 ==================================================


The formula for damage is:

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| DMG = [POW x RANDOM(1~1.125) - MDEF] x [2 + MAG x (Lv+MAG)/256)]           |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The formula for healing is:

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| HEAL = POW x RANDOM(1~1.125) x [2 + MAG x (Lv+MAG)/256)]                   |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that healing does not consider the magic defense of the target. The same
formula also applies when cure magics is targeted to enemy creatures (turns 
into large damage against undead, nice!).

The Syphon magic (MP absorb) also applies the second (heal) formula.

Similar to the weapon case, a couple of status conditions affect the final  
damage of magics. In addition, there are weather and terrain effects to
elemental damaging spells. Thanks to Red Star for providing the details below:

 ============================================================
| Status                 |  Damage Dealt   | Damage Received |

| (Heavy) Snow         | x1.2 | x1.2 |         |  x0.5 | x1.2 |       |
| Sandstorm            | x1.2 |      |         |  x0.5 | x1.2 |  x1.2 |
|----------------------|------|------|---------|-------|------|-------|
| Sand                 |      |      |         |       |      |  x1.2 |
| Water                |      |      |   x1.2  |  x1.2 |      |  x0.5 |
| Snow                 |      | x1.2 |         |       |      |       |
 =====================================================================

Note: The above modifiers are accumulative, and stack up by multiplication.

Here come the effects of other Hurt and Heal magics that does not depend on a
POW rating.

 ==================================================
| Name     |  Effect                               |
|----------|---------------------------------------|
| Balance  |  DMG = self MAX HP - self Current HP  | 
|----------|---------------------------------------|
| Gravity  |  DMG = target MAX HP / 4              | 
| Graviga  |  DMG = target MAX HP / 2              |
|----------|---------------------------------------|
| Renew    | Heal = target MAX HP - 1              |
|----------|---------------------------------------|
| Raise    | Heal = 0.4 X target MAX HP            |
| Arise    | Heal = target MAX HP                  |
 ==================================================

Note: The cure series magics harm undead, while the raise series magics
      instantly kill them. Although it sounds good, the success chance is
      not 100%, but: Raise (70%), Arise (35%), Renew (0%). Surprisingly, the
      more powerful the raise magic, the less likely it kills the undead.

By the way, the magical evasion of a shield may block a damaging spell, but
does not block a status attack spell (see section 3b).

[3b. Status Effect Magics]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks to Red Star for providing lots of information of this section.

First up, certain status effects cannot co-exist. 

Petrify - Doom
Disease - Bubble
Confuse - Berserk

For example, a berserk character cannot be confused.  In addition, you also
cannot use Decoy (Lure status) on a character who is inflicted by Stop, and
being hit by Stop will remove Lure status.

There are a few exceptions of the above rule. For example, the Befuddlement
Trap inflicts both Confusion and Berserk, while a reversed Remedy (by
Nihopalona) causes both Petrify and Doom. (Thanks to Andrew Preston, who
informed me of the Remedy effect.)

Here comes the list of status effect duration. (s = seconds)

 =====================================
| Name        |  Effect Duration      |
|-------------|-----------------------|
| X-Zone      |  Permanent            | (remove by change zone)
| K.O.        |  Permanent            |
| Petrify     |  Permanent            |
| Doom        |  Permanent            |
| Disease     |  Permanent            |
| Silence     |  Permanent            |
| Blind       |  Permanent            |
| Oil         |  Permanent            |
| Sap         |  Permanent            |
| HP Critical |  Permanent            |
|-------------|-----------------------|
| Stop        |   60 - (VIT x 0.3) s  |
| Confuse     |   80 - (VIT x 0.4) s  |
| Sleep       |   50 - (VIT x 0.25)s  |
| Reverse     |   14 - (VIT x 0.07)s  |
| Slow        |  120 - (VIT x 0.6) s  |
| Disable     |   40 - (VIT x 0.2) s  |
| Immobilized |  100 - (VIT x 0.5) s  |
| Poison      |  100 - (VIT x 0.5) s  |
|-------------|-----------------------|
| Libra       |  240 + (VIT x 2.4) s  |
| Float       |   60 + (VIT x 0.6) s  |
| Berserk     |   45 + (VIT x 0.45)s  |
| Haste       |   40 + (VIT x 0.4) s  |
| Bravery     |   40 + (VIT x 0.4) s  |
| Faith       |   50 + (VIT x 0.5) s  |
| Lure        |   20 + (VIT x 0.2) s  |
| Reflect     |   60 + (VIT x 0.6) s  |
| Protect     |   60 + (VIT x 0.6) s  |
| Shell       |   60 + (VIT x 0.6) s  |
| Bubble      |   60 + (VIT x 0.6) s  |
| Regen       |   90 + (VIT x 0.9) s  |
| Invisible   |   90 + (VIT x 0.9) s  |
 =====================================

Alternatively, they can be described by their own "Base Duration" (Thanks to
Terence):

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Beneficial status duration = Base Duration + (Base Duration * VIT / 100)  |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    Harmful status duration = Base Duration - (Base Duration * VIT / 200)  |
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Essentially, VIT makes beneficial statuses last longer (up to 99% extra), and
harmful statuses last shorter (up to 49.5% reduction).

Now thanks to Master ZED, now we have more knowledge on Reverse.

Reverse affects                       | Reverse does NOT affect

= Regular attacks                     |

                                      | = All recovery / damaging Techs


And similarly we have a list of statuses that Esuna cannot cure:

- X-Zone                               - Oil
- K.O.                                 - Disease (Thanks to edgexreaper)
- HP Critical                          - Slow
- Doom                                 - Stop
- "Petrified" (Esuna cures "Petrifying")

o Success Rate
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The success rate of negative status spells are independent of the magical
evasion of the target (which only blocks away a damaging spell).

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Success Rate = Base Rate + (MAG of user - VIT of target) %                 |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many magics have 100% basic hit chance, and many don't. Here comes a list of
magics that have less than 100% basic hit chance.

 =================================================================
| Time Magics | Rate | Green Magics | Rate | Arcane Magics | Rate |
|-------------|------|--------------|------|---------------|------|
| Bleed       |  80% | Oil          |  80% | Gravity       |  70% |
| Balance     |  70% | Sleep        |  65% | Graviga       |  40% |
| Slow        |  60% | Sleepga      |  55% | Reverse       |  70% |
| Slowga      |  55% | Silence      |  60% | Syphon        |  60% |
| Warp        |  55% | Silencega    |  55% | Berserk       |  60% |
| Doom        |  55% | Poison       |  60% | Decoy         |  60% |
| Immobilize  |  50% | Toxify       |  55% | Confuse       |  50% |
| Break       |  50% | Blind        |  60% | Death         |  35%*|
| Disable     |  45% | Blindga      |  55% |               |      |
| Stop        |  40% |              |      |               |      |
 =================================================================

Note: Some monster's special move has a certain chance to induce instant K.O.
      The K.O. chance is fixed and does not apply the formula here - more
      like an added effect of a weapon. For example, Zodiark's special spell
      comes with 50% Instant K.O..

As usual, there are modifiers that further complicate the success rates.

 =========================================
| Status          | Success Rate Modifier |
|-----------------|-----------------------|
| Shell           |         x 0.5         |
| Faith (on user) |         x 1.5         |
| HP Crit. MAG Up |         x 2.0         |
| Full HP MAG Up  |         x 2.0         |
 =========================================

Note: When equipping the Indigo Pendant, the above calculation result
      "Base Rate + (MAG of user - VIT of target)" is directly set to 100%.
      See section 8a for more.

Therefore, "Faith" and the "Serenity" license on the caster would really
help.

o Beserk & Decoy chances
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Althouth Berserk and Decoy are considered positive status, their success rate
is calculated as a negative status. 

Success Rate = Base Rate + (MAG of user - VIT of target)

And this success rate is further modified by Shell (x0.5), Faith (x1.5), 
Serenity (x2 if HP full), and Spellbreaker (x2 if HP critical).

Now thanks to trowabartan, we have some nice in-game testing data:

Spell: Berserk, Base Rate = 60%
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Run 1  Caster MAG 62 (Serenity)       100% success (118% predicted)
       Target VIT 63                  with Shell, starts to miss

Run 2  Caster MAG 29 (No Serenity)    ~1/6 success (26% predicted)
       Target VIT 63                  with Indigo Pendent, 100%

Run 3  Caster MAG 41 (Serenity)       ~2/3 success (58% predicted)
       Target VIT 72                  with Indigo Pendent, 100%
       
You can see that when the caster's and target's levels are about the same,
Serenity (success rate x2 when HP full) is sufficient to guarantee success
(~120%). Even if the caster has a much lower MAG, serenity also helps to boost
the rate, but no longer guarantees success.

If your Berserk, Decoy and Reverse miss a lot on your own party member, you
can raise your caster's MAG, and not to raise your target's VIT. You can also
purchase the Serenity lic. and keep your caster's HP full. If you want to make
sure 100% success, equip the Indigo Pendant on your caster. Yet in any case,
don't Shell on your target.

By the way, the item "Bacchu's Wine" gives Berserk status 50% of the time.

Here are some of the extra info. on status. I will repeat the Berserk, Haste
and Bravery buffs as they are very frequently used:

 ===============================================================
| Status    | What happens                                      |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Berserk   | Charge bar speed x2, Regular attack damage x1.5   | nice!
| Haste     | Charge bar speed x1.5                             |
| Bravery   | Regular attack damage x1.3                        |
| Slow      | Charge bar speed x0.5                             |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Regen     | Gain HP by "RANDOM (1~Lv)" per 1.5 seconds        | * Reverse
| Sap       | Lose 1 HP per 0.1 second                          | * has no
| Poison    | Lose around "MAX HP / 16" per 12 seconds          | * effect
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Invisible | Not be detected by enemies relying on "vision"    |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Petrify   | Count down from 10, numbers go down per ~4.5 sec  |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Doom      | Count down from 10, numbers go down per ~10 sec   |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Blind     | Regular attack accuracy reduced by 50%            |
 ===============================================================

It seems that battle speed does NOT affect the duration of status. Therefore,
the fastest battle speed will make the best use of the positive status affects
except Regen.

o Stop Trick
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is common sense that the status STOP stops everything. If you combine
Stop and Reverse, though, you have a damage-absorbing tank that never expires.

o Reflect Trick
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now this is an old trick that has worked in all FFs. Put Reflect on all your
party members, and cast magics on yourself to reflect it to the enemy. You
get one reflection from each party member, which means multiple damages. You
can also bypass enemy's Reflect status this way.

o Shell for the win?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Many bosses have the ability to ignore VIT, meaning their status attack will
always hit if you are not immune. However, if these statuses work like magics,
you can use the Shell status to avoid them 50% of the time. Now try that on
Zodiark, Yiazmat, Behemoth King or whatever that gives out instant K.O.
effect, and see if it makes a difference! (Honestly I don't know!)

______________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[3c. Motes]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Motes are items which contain magical powers that are usually identical to
their spell counterparts. For example, a Hastega Mote is like a Hastega
spell (Haste all). The only difference is that all Motes ignores the Reflect
effect, which makes them very useful when you cannot cast Dispel.

Certain Motes offers elemental damage, which is calculated by:

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| DMG = [POW x RANDOM(1~1.125) - MDEF] x [2 + MAG x (Lv+MAG)/256)]           |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the exact same formula of the magical damage, except that the POW here
is replaced by specific "Mote Power" that are listed below:

 ==========================================
| Name         |  POW  | Element |  Range  |
|--------------|-------|---------|---------|
| Dark Mote    |   28  |   Dark  |    6    |
|--------------|-------|---------|---------|
| Water Mote   |   42  |  Water  |  Single |
|--------------|-------|---------|---------|
| Aero Mote    |   66  |   Wind  |    6    |
|--------------|-------|---------|---------|
| Holy Mote    |   96  |   Holy  |  Single |
|--------------|-------|---------|---------|
| Scathe Mote  |  138  |   None  |    6    |
 ==========================================

Note: Eksir Berries (event item): POW = 30, Element = Dark.

These damages are also subject to additional modifications.

 ============================================================
| Status                 |  Damage Dealt   | Damage Received | 
|------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Faith                  |     x 1.3       |                 |
|------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Oil                    |                 |      x 3 (Fire) |
| Sleep                  |                 |      x 1.5      |
| Shell                  |                 |      x 0.75     |
|------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| HP Full MAG Up         |     x 1.2       |                 |
| HP Crit. MAG Up        |     x 2         |                 |
|------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Weapon's Element Bonus |     x 1.5       |                 |

| Elemental 1/2          |                 |      x 0.5      |
| Elemental Null         |                 |      x 0        |
| Elemental Absorb       |                 |   Heals x 1 (?) |
 ============================================================

______________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[3d. Fangs]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fangs are elemental items that deals damage 25% of enemy's MAX HP, with a
success chance of 50%.

 ===========================================
| Name         | Chance | Element |  Range  |
|--------------|--------|---------|---------|
| Red Fang     |   50%  |  Fire   |    6    |
|--------------|--------|---------|---------|
| Blue Fang    |   50%  |   Ice   |    6    |
|--------------|--------|---------|---------|
| White Fang   |   50%  | Thunder |    6    |
 ===========================================

Now since Fangs are elemental in nature, they are also further modified by:

 ======================================================
| Status           |  Damage Dealt   | Damage Received | 
|------------------------------------------------------|
| Fang's Element   |     x 1.5       |                 |
| Elemental Weak   |                 |      x 2        |
| Elemental 1/2    |                 |      x 0.5      |
| Elemental Null   |                 |      x 0        |
| Elemental Absorb |                 |   Heals x 1 (?) |
 ======================================================

The damage is further increased by 50% while wearing the accessory "Pheasant
Netsuke". It is then possible to instant kill an enemy by a correct Fang that
targets its weakness, plus this accessory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[3e. Knot of Rust & Dark Matter]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Knot of Rusts and Dark Matters are a special category of non-elemental,
damage-dealing items. Although Knot of Rust itself is not very effective, each
time you use them, the damage of Dark Matter increases.

The damage of Knot of Rust is:

 ---------------------------------
| DMG = Current HP / Random(1~10) | (CAP = 9999)
 ---------------------------------

Note that some sources use MAX HP, instead of Current HP. From various in-game
testing I am now certain it is the current HP that counts. For example, when a
character has the Bubble status, the KoR damage will increase, although the
character's "base" MAX HP remains the same. (Thanks to Corvoid who confirmed
this.) While getting hurt, the damage of KoR also reduces accordingly.

The damage of Dark Matter is the sum of ALL Knot of Rusts you have used
previously, divided by 3.

 --------------------------------------------------------------
| DMG = SUM (Knot of Rust DMG) / 3 + SUM (Devour Soul DMG) / 3 | (CAP = 60000)
 --------------------------------------------------------------

The counter of Dark Matter resets to 0 after each use. As you can see, this
is a potentially very damaging attack, useful for dealing the final blow
of a tough enemy.

Note: Devour Soul is NOT Souleater (although they literally mean the same).
      Devour Soul is a quite-regular attack of the Esper Shemhazai, with the
      same effect as Knot of Rust. This Esper uses a special attack, Soul
      Purge, which has the same effect as Dark Matter, and it resets the
      counter to 0 as well. Shemhazai uses Soul Purge when (1) Summon Time
      Remains < 10 seconds (2) HP < 30%. (Thanks to Red Star)

4. Techniques

______________________________________________________________________________
==============================================================================

In this section I will cover the mechanics of the most useful / inquired
techniques. While some techs always hit, most techs come with a base chance.
If not otherwise mentioned, the success chance for techs is calculated as:

 --------------------------------------------------------------
| Success Chance = Base Chance + (User's Lv - Target's Lv) (%) |
 --------------------------------------------------------------

However, if User's Lv is greater than Target's Lv, the chance becomes:

 --------------------------------------------------------------
| Success Chance = 3 x (User's Lv - Target's Lv) (%)           |
 --------------------------------------------------------------

Also, it is important to know that ALL techs are physical in nature, except
Shades of Black (magical). This means that damage-dealing techs will fail when
the target has physical damage immunity.

[4a. Daily Techs]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Daily techs are what you don't leave home without. But to be honest, Poach is
useless.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o Steal (CT = 30) (Special thanks: EOH @ www.gamer.com.tw)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stealing is NOT affected by battle chains! The only way to improve your chance
to steal better items is to equip the Thief's Cuff accessory.

All steal-able items are divided into 3 categories:

o High chance: 55%
o  Mid chance: 10%
o  Low chance:  3%

With the Thief's Cuff accessory, the chances are increased to:

o High chance: 80%
o  Mid chance: 30%
o  Low chance:  6%

Rare monsters only carry 1 item, and it usually belongs to the "Low" chance
category (3/6%).

The actual stealing happens in this manner:

 -------------------------   Yes ( 3/ 6%)
|  Steal Low chance Item? | -------------> Finish
 -------------------------
           | No (97/94%)
 -------------------------   Yes (10/30%)
|  Steal Mid chance Item? | -------------> Finish
 -------------------------
           | No (90/70%)
 -------------------------   Yes (55/80%)
| Steal High chance Item? | -------------> Finish
 -------------------------
           | No (45/20%)
 -------------------------
|    Stealing fails !!    |
 -------------------------

There is only one item to be stolen. Whenever you steal one item, the target
contains no more. However, the thief's cuff also enables you to steal multiple
items.

 -------------------------   Yes ( 3/ 6%)
|  Steal Low chance Item? | -------------> Go on to Mid chance Item
 -------------------------
           | No (97/94%)
 -------------------------   Yes (10/30%)
|  Steal Mid chance Item? | -------------> Go on to High chance Item
 -------------------------
           | No (90/70%)
 -------------------------   Yes (55/80%)
| Steal High chance Item? | -------------> Finish
 -------------------------
           | No (45/20%)
 -------------------------
|    Stealing fails !!    |
 -------------------------

In general, stealing is "one shot only" unless you fail. As soon as you steal
anything, the monster contains no more items. You will have to respawn the
monster (see Section 8b) in order to steal the item(s) again. There are a few
exceptions, such as Gilgamesh (5 stages, 5 items to steal). 


o Trick: Stealing safely
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks to X3mgame who provided this valuable trick. You can steal safely
from powerful monsters, especially the inactive (green bar) ones like Entites.

(1) Move your party leader forward until the target's HP bar shows.
(2) Send your party members to steal manually, but not the party leader.
(3) Get it or not, quickly go to the menu (triangle), and put the thieves back
    to reserve before they get targeted. Slowly move your party leader away
    from the angry target.

(4a) If you steal an item, then take your party leader and zone out. For
     inactive monsters you only need to get to the neighbor zone, to refresh
     the items to be stolen again.

(4b) If the steal fails, you can bring the two thieves back and steal again.
     As long as your party leader is out of range of the target, the thieves
     can keep stealing safely as the target is trying to chase down and target
     the far-away leader. You can't move the thieves back to reserve anymore,
     but you can always zone out with the party leader.

You can use this stealing method on almost any enemy to safely steal and 
quickly zone away. Since you will never get hit using his method, you can do
it for low level challenge, too!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o Poach (CT = 50, Base Chance = 80%)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Poach only works when the target monster is in critical HP status. There are 3
categories of poach rates:

o Always: 100%
o   High:  95%
o    Low:   5%

When a monster is poached, it drops the poach item, but does not leave EXP,
LP, Clan point, Gil and Drop items.

Chain level has NOTHING to do with Poach rate.

In many cases, the poach-able low chance items are identical to the monograph
drop items (I will explain what monograph drop is in section 5a). Therefore,
it is usually not necessary to poach the enemy to obtain your desired item.
See section 8c for more monster details.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o Libra (CT = 10)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Displays regular monsters' Lv, HP and weakness, and reveals traps (but not
what type of trap).

______________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[4b. Recovery Techs]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recovery techs are inferior alternatives to Magical and Item recovery, if you
happen to be prevented from using them. Infuse can be used in recovery, but
the real beauty of it is to harm yourself just enough.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o Charge (CT = 40)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charge is a useful technique to recover a small amount of MP when your MP runs
out. If you fail, though, your MP directly drops to 0. Better use it when you
have nothing to lose.

Late in the game, you will run into annoying enemies who deplete all your MPs
in one shot, so this technique becomes quite useful.

The success rate of Charge is:

 --------------------------------
| 1 - (Current MP/MP MAX + 0.01) |
 --------------------------------

So you can always succeed if you have less than 1% of MP left.
The amount of Mp recovery is based on:

 ------------------------------------
| MP recovery = Random (Lv ~ 1.33Lv) |
 ------------------------------------

So the higher your character's level, the more MP you can recover. If you want
to fill up MP more, use the magic "Syphon".

The Brady guide gives a lot of praise to Charge, but personally I found it
less effective than Syphon when I am not in a hurry, and less efficient
than a High Ether when I am in a hurry.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o First Aid  (CT = 15)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First Aid will only work when the target is in HP critical condition (< 20%
MAX HP). The recovery amount is:

 ---------------------------------------------
| HP recovery = 0.2 x MAX HP x Random (0 ~ 1) |
 ---------------------------------------------

So you would expect anywhere from 0 to 20% of MAX HP recovery. This is really
pathetic as any Hi- / X-potion can do better than that, and items have 0 CT!
This tech is really bad, and I only list it here to show you how bad it is.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o Revive  (CT = 25)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sacrifice all of user's HP (K.O.) to completely restore a K.O. ally's HP. If
used on an "alive" target, the user still gets K.O.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o Infuse  (CT = 40)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Convert all MP to HP by (10 x MP left). The original HP is replaced by the new
value.

Now thanks to Cryconius, who provides great insights into this tech:

     "... the main use for Infuse is to set your characters (and espers)
      at low HP to take advantage of things such as: Higher Combos, 2x
      damage dealing, greater damage from Balance and Zeromus' attacks,
      and (last but not least) triggering Espers' final attacks.

      As an example, I used Infuse as my main strategy for at least the
      first half of Yiazmat.  While one of my characters was tanking
      with Decoy and Reverse, another of my characters played
      "daredevil," using Infuse to get rid of MP, getting a little MP
      by attacking once, then Infusing again to set at <6.25% HP.  Then
      he just went crazy attacking Yiazmat, doing 8-12 hit combos for
      9999 damage per hit with Yagyu Darkblade."

______________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[4c. Damaging Techs]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Damaging techs are nice alternatives to... deal damages, as they penetrate
Reflect and Reverse, plus they ignore target's DEF and EVA! Some of these
damaging techs have an area effect, and their radius is always "6".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o Horology (CT = 40, Base chance = 70%, Area = 6)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The power of Horology solely depends on the second "MINUTE" digit on your game
clock.

For example, when you game clock is 12(hr):34(min):56(sec), the "4" is used.

 ---------------------------------------------
| Horology DMG = [1/2 x (Minute Digit^2)]     | (Thanks to Terence)
 ---------------------------------------------

 ====================
| Digit |   Damage   |
|-------|------------|
|   0   |     0      |
|   1   |  0.5 x Lv  |
|   2   |    2 x Lv  |
|   3   |  4.5 x Lv  |
|   4   |    8 x Lv  |
|   5   | 12.5 x Lv  |
|   6   |   18 x Lv  |
|   7   | 24.5 x Lv  |
|   8   |   32 x Lv  |
|   9   | 40.5 x Lv  |
 ====================

Therefore, the higher your level is, the more damage Horology can bring to
you. If you run out of effective ways to bring down an enemy, you can probably
check the in game clock. If it rests at 8 or 9, Horology might be the last
kick you need.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o Traveler (CT = 10, Base Chance = 100%, Area = 6)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Its power solely depends on the number of steps you have taken, since the last
time you use Traveler (or if this is your first time, since the beginning of
the game).

 ========================
|   Steps   |   Damage   |
|-----------|------------|
|   0 -  99 |  Step x 1  |
| 100 - 499 |  Step x 2  |
| 500 - 989 |  Step x 3  |
| 990 - 999 |  Step x 10 |
 ========================

Whenever the step count goes over 1000, it resets to 0. Basically, the game
only looks at the final 3 digits of the steps relative to the last reset.

Traveler is a potentially devastating attack early game. If you keep a close
track of your steps, you can get a 9900 - 9990 damage attack! (But you will
have to walk another 990 steps for the next one.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o Numerology (CT = 25, Area = 6)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Numerology deals damage in an "exponential" way. Every time you use it, the
damage DOUBLES for the next time, to a maximum of 2^17 = 131,072 !

Even better, it is has an effective radius, so you can hit more than one
enemies with it - and the splash damage is twice as much as the original
damage!

Numerology is potentially the most damaging single attack you can get, but to
achieve 131,072 damage you have to be really lucky. Also, whenever you misses,
the counter resets to 0 and you have to start from "2^0", an exciting 1 damage
again.

Here is how Numerology goes. "Splash" means the damage on surrounding mobs of
the target:

 =========================================================
| No. times used |   Hit  |  Target  | Splash |  Splash   |
| since reset    | Chance |   DMG    | Chance |    DMG    |
|----------------|--------|----------|--------|-----------|
|        0       |   85%  |        1 |    85% |         2 |
|        1       |   85%  |        2 |    84% |         4 |
|        2       |   84%  |        4 |    83% |         8 |
|        3       |   83%  |        8 |    81% |        16 |
|        4       |   81%  |       16 |    79% |        32 |
|        5       |   79%  |       32 |    76% |        64 |
|        6       |   76%  |       64 |    73% |       128 |
|        7       |   73%  |      128 |    69% |       256 |
|        8       |   69%  |      256 |    65% |       512 |
|        9       |   65%  |      512 |    60% |     1,204 |
|       10       |   60%  |    1,024 |    55% |     2,048 |
|       11       |   55%  |    2,048 |    49% |     4,096 |
|       12       |   49%  |    4,096 |    43% |     8,192 |
|       13       |   43%  |    8,192 |    36% |    16,384 |
|       14       |   36%  |   16,384 |    29% |    32,768 |
|       15       |   29%  |   32,768 |    21% |    65,536 |
|       16       |   21%  |   65,536 |    13% |   131,072 |
 =========================================================

You can also describe the Hit chance of Numerology with a simple equation
(thanks to Terence):

 ---------------------------------------------------------------
| Hit Chance for Nth time = Hit Chance for (N-1)th time - (N/2) |
 ---------------------------------------------------------------

There are a few important things to note:

1. The tech. always misses on the 17th time.
2. There is a single counter for the entire party.
3. Loading a save does not reset the counter (good news).
4. If you miss the target, then there won't be any splash damage.
5. Certain enemies are immune to Numerology even if you don't miss, but the 
   splash damage still works on its neighbors, if they are not immune to this
   tech as well.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o Gil Toss (CT = 45, Base Chance = 100%, Area = 6)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gil Toss offers very stable and spectacular damage output, only if you can
afford it.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------
| DMG = Gil Spent                                                |
|     = Sum of current party members' HP / # of enemies in range |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------

Note1: The damage (and Gil spent) is capped at 9999 each toss.
Note2: Nothing is immune to Gil Toss! (unless they are immune to physical DMG)

You will probably end up with a lot of unspent Gils at the end (in my first
playthrough I left with 2M rotting in the bank), so why not throw away some of
them now? It is also an extremely powerful technique, considering how much
damage you can inflict in total.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o Telekinesis (CT = 50, Base Chance = 75%)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This technique enables a character to hurt flying / far away monsters, while
holding a short-range weapon. If the character is equipped with a long-ranged
weapon, then this tech always misses.

The formula for Telekinesis damage is:

 ----------------------------------
| DMG = 0 ~ (ATK x Target's Lv) -1 |
 ----------------------------------

Therefore, for the best result, equip your highest-ATK weapon to perform
Telekinesis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o Souleater (CT = 35, Base Chance = 100%)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Souleater is equivalent to the "Dark" attack in FFIV, where you deal more
damage by hurting yourself.

 --------------------------------------------------------------
| DMG = 1.4 x ATK x Random(1~1.125) x (1 + STR x (Lv+STR)/256) |
 --------------------------------------------------------------

The amount of HP you lose is 20% of MAX HP.

Essentially, souleater is 1.4 times more powerful than a regular physical
attack, and it ignores the target's DEF. It is a nice technique to use when
the "Attack" command is sealed off. Equip your highest-ATK weapons for the
best result.

Note: Souleater damage actually heals undead, so be careful.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o Sight Unseeing (CT = 25, Base Chance = 10%)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This tech functions only when the user is inflicted with the Blind status.
If connected, it reduces the target's HP to a number between 0 and 8.

The range of Sight Unseeing is the same as user's weapon.

Monster's special ability "Safety" (see Section 8a) nullifies sight unseeing.

Note that as long as your level is higher than the target's level, the low
base chance is longer applied.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o Bone Crusher (CT = 45, Base Chance = 45%)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use user's own HP to kill one target. The damage sustained by the user is:

 ----------------------------------
| Self DMG = 0 ~ (User's Own HP-1) |
 ----------------------------------

However, if the tech misses, the user is directly gets K.O.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o 1000 Needles (CT = 30, Base Chance = 70%)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deals constant 1000 damage, which cannot be reduced by the target's damage
reducing ability.

______________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[4d. Status Techs]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There has been a smart "Stamp Trick" circulating around. Basically, you put
all positive status on a certain party member before hand, and stamp them all
at once on another member to save time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o Charm (CT = 35, Base Chance = 50%)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Puts the "Confuse" status on one target.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o Stamp (CT = 55, Base Chance = 60%)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Copy and Paste all of the user's own status to a target, except HP critical.

Much thanks to Frioniel2006, who performed some solid experiments, we now have
detailed mechanics for Stamp:

- Character: Penelo   Lv 56 (VIT 44, Spellbound Augment)
             Balthier Lv 54 (VIT 50, Spellbound Augment)

- Penelo is the stamper, and Blathier is the receiver.
- The timer starts when the original spell is cast on Penelo (t=0)
- The stamp time (T-stamp) is taken when Stamp completes. 
- The end time (T-end) is taken when status disappears. T-end(P) for Penelo,
  T-end(B) for Balthier.
- "*": Status comes from equipment
- All are units in seconds.

 ============================================================
| Run | Status   | T-stamp |  T-end(P) | T-end (B) | Comment |
|-----|----------|---------|-----------|-----------|---------|
|  1  | Haste    |    none |      85.0 |      none | Control |
|  2  | Haste    |    none |      none |      90.5 | Control |
|-----|----------|---------|-----------|-----------|---------|
|  3  | Haste    |     5.2 |      85.2 |      85.2 |         |
|  4  | Haste    |    56.3 |      85.1 |      85.1 |         |
|-----|----------|---------|-----------|-----------|---------|
|  5  | Protect  |    none |     129.3 |      none | Control |
|  6  | Protect  |    none |      none |     135.4 | Control |
|-----|----------|---------|-----------|-----------|---------|
|  7  | Protect  |    13.0 |     129.0 |     129.0 |         |
|  8  | Protect  |   103.3 |     103.3 |     103.3 |         |
|-----|----------|---------|-----------|-----------|---------|
|  9  | Protect* |         | Permenant |     135.2 |         |
 ============================================================

It is clear that:

(1) The duration of Stamped status is identical to the left-over duration
    of the status on the stamper. The later you stamp, the shorter the
    "copy & paste" status will last. This is most evident when you stamp a
    count-down type status (Petrify & Doom).

(2) While stamping an equipment status, the duration is the same as casting
    a fresh buff on the target.

Also, duration of an existing status will be overridden by the last stamp
(with the exception of auto-statuses).

By the way, statuses gained after the Stamp action starts charging will not be
stamped, so it is impossible to stamp action-pausing statuses like Confuse,
Stop, etc. (Thanks to master ZED)

______________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[4e. Stats Techs]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stats techs alter the target's stats. Expose is particularly useful against
a few ultra-high-HP bosses in the game.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o Wither / Addle / Expose / Shear (CT = 45 for all)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These techniques reduce the enemy's STR, MAG, DEF and MDEF, respectively.
Let's summarize them in one table. The last column describes whether there is
a monster's special ability (many do) that gives immunity to this tech.

 ===============================================================
| Name    | Lowers  | To                 | base chance | Immune |
|---------|---------|--------------------|-------------|--------|
| Wither  | STR     | Current STR x 0.5  |     66%     |   Yes  |
|---------|---------|--------------------|-------------|--------|
| Addle   | MAG     | Current MAG x 0.5  |     66%     |   Yes  |
|---------|---------|--------------------|-------------|--------|
| Expose  | DEF     | Current DEF x 0.9  |     33%     |    No  |
|---------|---------|--------------------|-------------|--------|
| Shear   | MDEF    | Current MDEF x 0.9 |     33%     |    NO  |
 ===============================================================

The minimal value for these stats is 0.

Note there is a diminishing return on each subsequent reduction.

The effects of them are said to be permanent and cannot be removed. Nice!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o Achilles (CT = 55, Base Chance = 40%)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Randomly creates one "weakness" to one target. A lot of monsters are immune
to it, though.

There is only one magical tech.

o Shades of Black (CT = 45)

not require corresponding licenses.

5. Loots & Treasures

______________________________________________________________________________
Final Fantasy XII: Chances Over-reloaded =====================================

In this section I will explain how battle chain works on drop rates, and list
the chances for the best chests in the game.

______________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[5a. Drops, Battle Chain & Related]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you kill the same family (type) of enemies in a row, you accumulate
chains numbers. Chain numbers ultimately give you advanced "level" of chains.
There are four chain levels (Lv0-Lv3), which influences the loot you obtained
when the enemy is defeated (i.e. drops).

All drops fall into one of the five categories: "Always", "High" (chance),
"Mid", "Low", and "Super Low". "Always" drops are very rare, and I will
mention the most important of them in section 8c. 

Here is how chain level affects the drop chances of items:

 ===========================================
| Name      |  Lv0  |  Lv1  |  Lv2  |  Lv3  |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Icon      |  bag  | blue  | gold  | HUGE  |
|           |       | coin  | coin  | coin  |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| High      |  40%  |  45%  |  50%  |  55%  |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Mid       |  25%  |  30%  |  35%  |  40%  |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Low       |   3%  |   6%  |   8%  |  12%  |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Super Low |   1%  |   2%  |   3%  |   5%  |
 ===========================================

So here comes an important point -- no matter how high your chain number is,
if you chain level is low, your chances to get rare drops are still low.

A lot of the good drops fall into the "Super Low" category, so it would
really help to chain monsters to lv3, which boosts the drop chance by a
whooping 500%, to... 5%. 

Each drop is independent of each other. You can get all kinds of drops in one
bag.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are three ways to break your battle chain:

(1) Kill a different type of monster, obviously
(2) Enter a town (where only Vaan is walking. Yeah I know, why not Fran?)
(3) Touch a save crystal. (If you just pass by it, you are fine.)


Besides regular drops, there are two additional categories of drops that are
only available under certain conditions. The drop chance for these additional
drops are NOT affected by chain levels.

o Monograph Drop
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first additional category is the "Monograph Drops". Various Monographs
(Bazaar Items) enables you to get ADDITIONAL DROPs, but they do NOT improve
the chances for regular drops (High, Mid, Low, Super Low).

For example, a monster regularly drops A, B and C. With a corresponding
Monograph, it is now possible to get drop D. The chances for drop A, B and C
remain the same. (Thanks to Kesons at bbs.ffsky.com) A common drop D is Pebble;
that's why you get tons of them after buying the Monographs.

Many items listed in the Bestiary's second page (in blue fonts, such as
Cactoid's Bundle of Needles) are actually Monograph drops. However, although
the Slimes (192) are said to carry Slime Oil, they actually don't. (Thanks to
ShuraKaretny who informed me about this. This is now confirmed.)

o Canopic Jar Drop
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The second additional category is the "Canopic Jar Drops". They work similar
to the Monographs, that the presence of the Canopic Jar enables all enemies
to have a fixed chance to drop Arcana (drop E, in the above context). Those
who drops Arcana now have a chance to drop High Arcana.

o Chain Level Increase & Loot Picking
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So how does the chain level increase? It is partially random. The bottom line
is, if you DO NOT pick up any loot (drop), you can always level up your
chain between 6 to 10 kills.

 =================================================
| Kills required to |     |     |     |     |     |
| the next Chain Lv |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  | 10  |
|-------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Current Chain Lv  |     |     |     |     |     |
| = 0               | 40% | 60% | 80% | 90% |100% |
|-------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| = 1               | 20% | 30% | 50% | 60% |100% |
|-------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| = 2               | 10% | 20% | 30% | 40% |100% |
 =================================================

In other words, if you do NOT pick up any drop, you can reach Chain Lv3
between 18 to 30 kills.

So what if you pick up loots?

The hidden counter towards your next level up will go down by 1(Lv0), 2(Lv1),
or 3(Lv2) every time you turn to the dark side.

Even if you pick up all loots, you can still level up the chains eventually,
since there are forced level ups.

31 Chain --> Lv 1
51 Chain --> Lv 2
81 Chain --> Lv 3

The actual threshold is probably randomized, as I often receive forced level
ups sooner / later than the above chain numbers.

o Chain Benefits
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After reaching a higher chain level, you start to get nice bonus like HP and
MP recoveries, as well as Protect and Shell status.

 ========================================================================
| Chain | HP Recovery | MP Recovery |  Leader | Leader |   All   |  All  |
| Level |  10% MAX HP |  10% MAX MP | Protect |  Shell | Protect | Shell |
|-------|-------------|-------------|---------|--------|---------|-------|
|   0   |      0%     |      0%     |    0%   |    0%  |    0%   |   0%  |
|-------|-------------|-------------|---------|--------|---------|-------|
|   1   |     10%     |     10%     |    0%   |    0%  |    0%   |   0%  |
|-------|-------------|-------------|---------|--------|---------|-------|
|   2   |     20%     |     20%     |    5%   |    5%  |    0%   |   0%  |
|-------|-------------|-------------|---------|--------|---------|-------|
|   3   |     25%     |     25%     |    0%   |    0%  |    5%   |   5%  |
 ========================================================================

Nice!

o Chain Number Flashing
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From time to time, you will see the chain number flashing. This happens 5%
of the time, meaning that you have can now pick up loots WIHOUT PENALTY. In
other words, you can leave the loots lie on the ground, and pick as them up
all at once. The only way to end this no-penalty time is to kill the next
monster without the flashing continuing.

Note: In earlier versions I made a mistake by saying that you only have a few
      seconds to pick up loots, but actually you will not be penalized even if
      the flashing stops after a few seconds. (Thanks to zidane37 for pointing
      this out.) Take your time but just don't kill the next monster yet,
      because --

Every time the chain number starts flashing, you have a 60% chance to keep it
flashing when you kill the next monster. Apparently you do not have to kill
the next monster before the flashing ends, as I find even if you have a few
seconds of gap, the flashing still has a high chance to continue.

Since you are not penalized for picking up loots during a flash, it is now
also easier to reach the next chain level. This is why there is an earlier
hypothesis circulating around that "flashing + kill = chain level up". It
is not a direct cause and effect, rather than the flashing makes chain level
up easier to achieve.

By the way, there is also another earlier hypothesis that chain flashing is
related to rare monster spawn. Nice try, They are not related, but nice try.

o Multiple Items
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition, sometimes you can get more than one of the same item in a single
drop. This is because you have killed the "SAME" enemy in a row. The enemies
has to be "THE SAME". For example, wolves and hyenas are not the same.

You can get mostly 4 items of the same kind in one drop. The following table
lists the chances of the number of items you received under different
conditions. Note that 100% does not mean you can always get the item, just
that if you do get it in the first place (for example, a 5% chance for the
"Super Low" category), then there is a 100% chance to get 1 of this item, 
not 2, 3 or 4.

 ===================================================
| Same enemies       |       |       |       |      |
| Killed in a row    |  1-10 | 11-18 | 19-26 | > 26 |
|--------------------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| Items received = 1 |       |       |       |      |
| Chance = High      |  100% |   65% |   30% |   0% |
|        = Mid       |  100% |   70% |   40% |   0% |
|        = Low       |  100% |  100% |   80% |  60% |
|        = Super Low |  100% |  100% |  100% |  90% |
|--------------------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| Items received = 2 |       |       |       |      |
| Chance = High      |       |   35% |   50% |  60% |
|        = Mid       |       |   30% |   50% |  80% |
|        = Low       |       |       |   20% |  25% |
|        = Super Low |       |       |       |  10% |
|--------------------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| Items received = 3 |       |       |       |      |
| Chance = High      |       |       |   20% |  30% |
|        = Mid       |       |       |   10% |  15% |
|        = Low       |       |       |       |  10% |
|        = Super Low |       |       |       |      |
|--------------------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| Items received = 4 |       |       |       |      |
| Chance = High      |       |       |       |  10% |
|        = Mid       |       |       |       |   5% |
|        = Low       |       |       |       |   5% |
|        = Super Low |       |       |       |      |
 ===================================================

In some cases a monster can drop the identical item in different categories
at the same time. This should not be confused with the above bonus.

o Hidden (Reverse) Chain
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is one additional battle chain - the Hidden (Reverse as described in the
Brady Guide) Chain. All you need to do is to NOT kill the same type of
monsters in a row, which would result in a build up of a regular battle chain.

For example, a Hidden (Reverse) Chain is built up when you kill Wolf ->
Cactoid -> Wolf -> Cactoid -> Wolf...

And this is your benefit:

 =====================================================
| Equivalent Chain Lv |  < 5  |  6-11 | 12-19 | > 20  |
|---------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Lv 0                | 100%  |  85%  |  75%  |  65%  |
|---------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Lv 1                |       |  10%  |  15%  |  20%  |
|---------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Lv 2                |       |   5%  |  10%  |  15%  |
 =====================================================

For example, when you build up this Hidden (Reverse) chain to more than 20
(not displayed in the game), you have a 15% chance to receive the same item
drop that you would otherwise receive with a regular chain level 2. That's
not good at all!

[5b. Chests & Diamond Armlet]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The often-criticized chest system in FF12 follows quite a new concept. There
are lots of random elements to it. First, a chest has a certain chance to
spawn (to even appear). If the chest spawns, it has a certain chance to give
a variable amount of Gil. If the chest does not contain Gil, it will contain
items. Usually, there are two possible items splitting the chance 50-50. In
some cases the two possible items are identical.

So what does the accessory Diamond Armlet do? The accessory only affects the
item content when the chest (1) spawns (2) is not Gil. Two different items
will be available, usually splitting the chance in a 90-10 fashion. Most of the
times, the 90% chance item is, you guessed it, Knot of Rust.

As you can see, you can potentially waste a lot of time to get what you want
from the chests. The same is true for steals and drops, which I have covered
above. In my opinion, this slow grinding motion is a very inconsiderate and
shallow game design, which is consistently used by online game companies to
drain away time and money from players. Of course, the ultimate responsibility
falls on the those of us who insist to pursue the insignificant perfection.
In my opinion, this game can be so much better without these tedious and
repetitive elements.

Anyways, here comes my pick of all interesting chests in each individual area
of the game. Please note that certain chests only spawn once, so if you don't
get what you want, it is all over. Better be careful! While some of the best
items are hidden in chests that respawn, the chances to get them are usually
low, or plain sadistic (goes as low as 0.1%).

By the way, for chests to respawn, move at least 3 zones away and come back.

Abbreviations:

Spawn = Chance for the chest to spawn
   nD = Chance to get the item, when the chest spawns, no diamond armlet
    D = Chance to get the item, When the chest spawns, equip diamond armlet
  *1* = One chance chest, no respawn if opened.

Sorry I can't draw the maps showing the exact location of these chests, so you
probably have to consult a graphic guide for details.

 ============================================================================
| Chest Location        | Item                    | Spawn(%) | nD(%) |  D(%) |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|----------|-------|-------|
| Dalmasca Estersand    | Rod                     |    75    |   30  |    0  |
|  Sand-swept Naze      |                         |          |       |       |
 ============================================================================
*This Rod (ATK 30) can be obtained as soon as the game starts. Thanks to
 Arthellinu's Power Walkthrough, and the original credit goes to x3mgame.

 ============================================================================
| Chest Location        | Item                    | Spawn(%) | nD(%) |  D(%) |

|  Hall of the Sentinel |                         |          |       |       |
 ============================================================================
*This (ATK 59) 1-H Sword is powerful, but if you are going for Deathbringer,
 this sword will soon become obsolete.

 ============================================================================
| Chest Location        | Item                    | Spawn(%) | nD(%) |  D(%) |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|----------|-------|-------|
| Barheim Passage       |                         |          |       |       |
|  The Zeviah Span      | Celebrant's Miter       |   HIGH   |  MID  |       |
|                       | Cleric's Robe           |   HIGH   |  MID  |       |
|  West Annex           | Dragon Mail             |    MID   |  LOW  |       |
|                       | Zodiac Escutcheon       |     30   |    0  |    6  |
 ============================================================================
*The Barheim key can be obtained after obtaining the Dawn Shard. I have no
 guide data on the other chests, so I am giving some estimate based on my
 impressions. These helm and armors are very nice equipments. The Zodiac
 Escutcheon has a very low chance (1.8%) to pop with Diamond Armlet.

 ============================================================================
| Chest Location            | Item                | Spawn(%) | nD(%) |  D(%) |
|---------------------------|---------------------|----------|-------|-------|
| Necrohol of Nabudis       | *1* Zodiac Spear    |   100    |  100  |    0  |
|  Cloister of the Highborn |                     |          |       |       |
 ============================================================================
*The famous Zodiac Spear is always here if you haven't opened any of the four
 forbidden chests before. (Check other FAQs for details.) There is absolutely
 no clue given in the game not to open them, though. Do you feel like me,
 like... want to punch some game developer in the face?

 ============================================================================
| Chest Location        | Item                    | Spawn(%) | nD(%) |  D(%) |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|----------|-------|-------|
| Lhusu Mine            | Fomalhaut               |    60    |   50  |    0  |
|  Behind Antlion Mark  |                         |          |       |       |
 ============================================================================
*This is the easiest way to get the most powerful gun, and get it early. This
 chest is also probably the most friendly respawn chest that contains a
 top-tier item.

 ============================================================================
| Chest Location        | Item                    | Spawn(%) | nD(%) |  D(%) |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|----------|-------|-------|
| Feywood               | *1* Ensanguined Shield  |    25    |  100  |  100  |
|  The Edge of Reason   |                         |          |       |       |
 ============================================================================
*The shield (+90 EVA, plus permanent, multiple negative status) is not as
 useful as it seems, because a lot of tough monsters have the special ability
 to totally ignore shield blocking. (See section 8a)

 ============================================================================
| Chest Location        | Item                    | Spawn(%) | nD(%) |  D(%) |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|----------|-------|-------|
| Cerobi Steppe         | Ribbon                  |    50    |    0  |    3  |
 ============================================================================
*Cerobi Steppe is a huge area where a lot of nice items, especially ammos,
 respawn at miserable rates (see the above Ribbon for an example). If you
 feel lucky, and have a lot of hours to throw away, then maybe you can come
 here to open them one by one, over and over. Generally speaking, the nice
 items are available only with the Diamond Armlet here.

 Usually, you can get the same items much more easily from Bazaar or an
 one-time-only chest somewhere else. However, some people argue this 1.5%
 chest is actually the fastest way to farm unlimited Ribbon. If you only want
 one, go to Pharos.

 ============================================================================
| Chest Location        | Item                    | Spawn(%) | nD(%) |  D(%) |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|----------|-------|-------|
| Great Crystal         | *1* Excalibur           |    20    |  100  |  100  |
|  Secret Area          | *1* Zodiac Escutcheon   |    20    |   50  |  100  |
 ============================================================================
*While paying Ultima a visit, don't forget to pick up these two top-quality 
 equipment (Holy 2-H Sword, +128; the best Shield, +50).

 Excalibur is located at a deadend, and the end of a long stretch of 2-exit
 rooms from Gate XIV. Note that the Excalibur chest spawns (20%) right AFTER
 you opened the first chest, at the same location.

 The Zodiac Escutcheon chest is located beyond Taurus Gate II. This is also
 the easiest way to get a Zodiac Escutcheon, and you need only one tank,
 anyways. The alterative item to the Zodiac Escutcheon chest is Brave Suit,
 which is far less useful, and you can get one from Henne's Mine quite easily.

 ============================================================================
| Chest Location        | Item                    | Spawn(%) | nD(%) |  D(%) |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|----------|-------|-------|

|  Spire Ravel - 2nd    |                         |          |       |       |

|                       | *1* Lordly Robe         |    45    |  100  |    0  |
|                       | *1* Duel Mask           |    50    |  100  |    0  |
 ============================================================================
*Don't forget to pick up the Circlet (best Mystic helm) on your way up. There
 are quite a lot of top-tier chests in Pharos underground. The Lordly Robe is
 the best Mystic armor that goes well with Masamune, while the Duel Mask is
 the best Light helm.

 ============================================================================
| Chest Location        | Item                    | Spawn(%) | nD(%) |  D(%) |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|----------|-------|-------|
| Henne Mine            | *1* Ensanguished Shield |    50    |  100  |    0  |
|  Secret Area          | *1* Fomalhaut           |    40    |    0  |   80  |
|                       | *1* Brave Suit          |    25    |  100  |    0  |
|                       | Zodiac Spear            |    10    |    0  |    1  |
|                       | Ribbon                  |    55    |   20  |    0  |
|                       | Brave Suit              |    25    |    0  |    2  |
|                       | Lordly Robe             |    40    |  27.5 |    0  |
 ============================================================================
*Here comes the legendary 1/1000 chance Zodiac Spear. The Ribbon and Lordly
 Robe chests might worth a try. The Brave Suit is the best Light armor, but it
 offers hardly any HP bonus, and its DEF is miserable. It is useful when your
 character will likely to die soon, such as from an instant K.O. status.

 By the way, the 1-chance-only Brave Suit chest is beside the Ribbon chest
 deep inside, while the low-chance Brave Suit chest is close to the orange
 save crystal.


o Diamond Armlet on whom?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Diamon Armlet functions as long as any active party member is wearing it in
the accessory slot. It does not work on reserves.


o End Game Farming: Hi-ether, Elixir, and Megaelixir
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These are the best places I have witnessed so far. If you know better places
please share with us.

[Hi-Ether] Cerobi Steppe - Feddik River
---------------------------------------
This is the 3-in-1 zone where you can steal Scarletite from a rare monster.
All of the 10 chests in that zone spawn 50% of the time, with 50% items,
and, 50% to give a Hi-Ether, without the Diamond Armlet acc. So every run nets
you 1.25 Hi-Ethers in average. You can save a the blue crystal on the west,
which has a quick access to this zone. On your way back you can even check
the 1.5% Ribbon chest (requires DA).

[Elixir] Pharos - 1st Ascent
----------------------------
Just north of the 2nd waystone (5F?) lies a chest hidden behind a fake wall.
In Brady guide, this chest is labeled "#5". It has 65% chance to spawn,
80% for items, 50% Elixir without Diamond Armlet. If not Elixir you get a Hi-
Potion. You have 26% chance to get an Elixir per run. After the waystones are
activated you can get here very quickly from the orange save crystal just
downstairs.

[MegaElixir] Cerobi Steppe - The Northsward / Henne Mines secret area
----------------------------------------------------------------------
There seems to be no easy MegaElixir - you have to gamble for that 90-10 split
with Diamond Armlet.

In Cerobi Steppe, go NE of the Hi-ether farm zone, there are three chests
close to your entrance (labeled #41-#43 in Brady Guide). Each spawns 50% of
the time, gives item 50% of the time, and if both of that happen, you have 10%
chance to grab a MegaElixir. So you can expect 0.075 MegaExlixir every run.
Not very impressive, but you can do it with the Hi-Ether run.

Another option is to go to Henne Mines secret area while you aim for the
chests of Brave Suit, Ribbon, Lordly Robe, etc. Almost every chest there
has a tiny chance to pop MegaElixir.

[6a. Stat Growth Formula]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HP & MP Growth in FF12 are a little random. They can be described by the
following formula:

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| MAX HP = (Base HP + Sum of HP Bonus up to this level) x HP Modifier        |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| MAX MP = (Base MP + Sum of MP Bonus up to this level) x MP Modifier        |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where,  Base = Base value. Different character has different Base values.
       Bonus = Each level comes with its own Min and Max Bonus. The game
               randomly picks a Bonus within the Min and Max range (see below)
               when the level increases. Note that all characters share the 
               same bonus table.
    Modifier = Different characters have different modifiers. You can say
               the modifier represents the "growth rate".

Another set of formula is applied while dealing with STR, MAG, VIT and SPD
growths:

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Base + (Level x Modifier)/128                                              |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where,  Base = Base value. Different character has different values.
       Level = The current level of the character
    Modifier = Different characters have different modifiers (growth rate)

The growth for STR, MAG, VIT and SPD are fixed, as there is no random element
involved.

Here comes a table of characters' base (BA) and modifier (MO) values:

 ==========================================================================
| Party    |    HP     |    MP     |   STR   |   MAG   |   VIT   |   SPD   |

| Balthier | 48 | 1.44 | 37 | 0.48 | 24 | 67 | 17 | 51 | 24 | 45 | 24 | 19 |
| Fran     | 41 | 1.38 | 40 | 0.55 | 22 | 64 | 18 | 54 | 20 | 43 | 23 | 18 |
| Basch    | 59 | 1.50 | 35 | 0.44 | 25 | 68 | 20 | 50 | 20 | 36 | 23 | 16 |
| Ashe     | 40 | 1.37 | 46 | 0.57 | 21 | 68 | 21 | 63 | 23 | 44 | 23 | 17 |
| Penelo   | 39 | 1.33 | 63 | 0.55 | 20 | 65 | 18 | 66 | 23 | 48 | 24 | 16 |
 ==========================================================================

And here are some party guests' stats in case you are curious:

 ==========================================================================
|          |    HP     |    MP     |   STR   |   MAG   |   VIT   |   SPD   |
| Guest    | BA    MO  | BA    MO  | BA   MO | BA   MO | BA   MO | BA   MO |
|----------|-----------|-----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Reks     | 50 | 1.35 | 43 | 0.62 | 23 | 66 | 21 | 60 | 23 | 42 | 35 | 15 |
| Larsa    | 41 | 1.34 | 63 | 0.55 | 20 | 65 | 21 | 66 | 23 | 48 | 24 | 16 |
| Vossler  | 57 | 1.60 | 25 | 0.66 | 26 | 70 | 20 | 50 | 20 | 36 | 24 | 18 |
| Reddas   | 73 | 1.57 | 43 | 0.62 | 24 | 67 | 21 | 60 | 25 | 42 | 35 | 19 |
 ==========================================================================

It is quite surprising that Vossler, Reks and Reddas get some extremely high
MP growth rate, which is completely wasted. Larsa is basically Penelo in
disguise, and Vossler beats Basch in everything, Duh.

The Ultimania guide also lists the stats for Espers (see section 9 for more
details on Espers).

 =====================================================

For example, when Vaan starts as level 1, he can pick up either the HP bonus
10 or 11.

Pick HP Bonus 10 = (46 + 10) x 1.48 = 82.88
Pick HP Bonus 11 = (46 + 11) x 1.48 = 84.36

So Vaan's MAX HP can be either 82 or 84 when he is level 1.
When Vaan goes to level 2, he can pick up either 11, 12 or 13. So his total
max HP now has more possibilities:

         Lv 1         Lv 2
     -----------   -----------
Pick HP Bonus 10 + HP Bonus 11 = (46 + 21) x 1.48
Pick HP Bonus 10 + HP Bonus 12 = (46 + 22) x 1.48
Pick HP Bonus 11 + HP Bonus 11 = (46 + 22) x 1.48
Pick HP Bonus 10 + HP Bonus 13 = (46 + 23) x 1.48
Pick HP Bonus 11 + HP Bonus 12 = (46 + 23) x 1.48
Pick HP Bonus 11 + HP Bonus 13 = (46 + 24) x 1.48

And so on.

In addition, while picking the random HP bonus, the game is biased against
the highest possible bonus. For example, from level 1 to level 2, HP bonus
is between 11 and 13. The game set the chances for each bonus to be:

11: 5/11
12: 5/11
13: 1/11

Similarly, from level 22 to 23, HP bonus is between 32 and 38. The chances
become this:

32: 5/32
33: 5/32
34: 5/32
35: 5/32
36: 5/32
37: 5/32
38: 2/32

Did you see the pattern? 
Denominator: the lowest bonus
Numerator (everything but the highest bonus): 5
Numerator (highest bonus): the remainder of "the lowest bonus divided by 5".

Therefore, it is perfectly normal that a character ends up with less HP than
the average of Min & Max HP listed in strategy guides.

The MP bonuses have equal chances to be picked. So your expected MP is the
average of the Min and Max.

You can actually describe HP and MP bonus growth simply with the following
equations: (Thanks to Terence)

 -----------------------------------------------------------------
| HP Bonus Growth = Min HP Bonus + Random[0 ~ (Min HP Bonus-1)/5] |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| MP Bonus Growth = Min MP Bonus + Random[0 ~ (Min MP Bonus-1)]   |
 -----------------------------------------------------------------

Note that (Min HP Bonus-1)/5 is first rounded down. Then, these bonuses will
be multiplied by the HP / MP modifier, and then again rounded down to produce
the actual MAX HP and MP.


o Stats Capped?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note that Lv, STR, MAG, VIT and SPD are all capped at 99, so any overflow (due
to equipment bonus) is wasted.

On the other hand, HP and MP are not capped at 9999 and 999, although the
screen numerical display seems so. The horizontal bar below the number more
accurately reflects the truth. (Thanks John Chiofolo for clarifying this.)

[6b. Stat Growth & Experience Chart]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the data available, I worked out some MS Excel spreadsheet and computed
the entire stat growth chart for the six main characters. Instead of listing
the 1-out-of-100-trillion Min and Max HP and MP, I'll show the Mean (Average)
and Standard Deviation.

Standard Deviation, in simple words, is the extent of the variation from the
Mean (Average) listed on its left. There is about a 67% chance that your HP
and MP will fall into the range between (Mean - StdDev) and (Mean + StdDev),
and a 95% chance to fall between (Mean - 2 x StdDev) and (Mean + 2 x StdDev).

Note that when Basch, Ashe and Penelo finally join for good, their HP and MP
are all randomized from their previous (guest) appearances. So, if you are
trying to reload the game until you get some satisfying HP/MP, focus on the
last time.

Naturally you would like to make sure your character don't end up with very
poor HP and MPs within the possible range. To make quality control easier,
synchronize your 3 main characters' Lv and EXP, so they level up roughly at
the same time, but not all together. Space them out with a little EXP. When
they are about to level up in a row, camp around a nearby save crystal that
has very fast access to juicy & easy-killing monsters. If bad luck strikes,
pause, square, up, cross. 

Note that I am not suggesting you to go for the highest HP and MP possible,
since that can be as tedious as the 0.1% Zodiac Spear chest times 600. Here
are a few facts just to scare you away:

(1) Whenever your Min HP bonus is "5n + 1", you will be battling against
    formidable odds like 1/41, 1/46, 1/51, and on top of that you multiply
    1/4, 1/5 for Max MP bonus. Do that for every character - very funny.

(2) There is often NO way to verify that you have obtained the Max MP bonus,
    as "Max MP Bonus" and "Max MP Bonus - 1" will often get rounded down to
    the same apparant MP. Not until a level, or many levels later you will
    finally find out you have lost a few MP points without a trace.

And here comes the experience and level chart. Special thanks to Anime for
typing it up.

[6d. Ability from Accessories ]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FF12 includes quite a few accessories that "increases X when Y", but never
explains them in detail. Here is a list of what they do exactly.  The number
in the first column is the License Board number of the accessory.

Many of these abilities are equivalent to a certain license that you can
purchase. Having both the license and the acc. does not increase the bonus,
though.

Quite a lot of these special abilities are also possessed by monsters; some of
them become more powerful, some of them less. See section 8a for details.

7. Mist Quickening

______________________________________________________________________________
==============================================================================

Although nobody, including the CG artists, has any idea what actually happens
during Mist Quickenings, all Quickening damages are physical damages. They
come with their own damage formula that is totally different from the usual
ATK-DEF calculation. Let's start with the basics.

______________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[7a. Time Left]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Generally speaking, the time allowed for each hit reduces while the hit number
goes up. The exact formula for time allowed in hit k+1 is:

 ------------------------
| T(k+1) = T(k) - X(k)/2 |
 ------------------------

While T(1) = 4 seconds.

X(k) is the time the player spends to make an action in hit k.

In other words, you are always given 4 seconds in the first hit. If you are
fast, you get more time in subsequent hits as well. Let's have an example.

T(1) = 4 <-- 4 seconds are allowed for the first hit.

X(1) = 0.4 <-- the player spends 0.4 second to press a button, initiating the
                   second hit.

T(2) = T(1) - X(1)/2 = 4 - 0.2 = 3.8 <-- 3.8 seconds are allowed in the second
                                         hit.

______________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[7b. Mist Charge]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During a Quickening, the chance for "Mist Charge" to appear as an option  
depends on the number of Quickening participants.

1 Participant:  1/6
2 Participants: 1/7
3 Participants: 1/8

Note: If you have three full bars of mist points (MP), the option of Mist  
      Charge never appears.

______________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[7c. Damage: Regular Hit]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The damage of each quickening hit is:

 -------------------------------------
| DMG = RANDOM(1~POW) x RANDOM(1~STR) |
 -------------------------------------

POW is a fixed number that only depends on the level of Quickening.

POW (Lv1) =  90
POW (Lv2) = 140
POW (Lv3) = 230

STR is the strength of the character performing the particular hit, as  
Quickening deals physical damage.

All characters have the same Quickening Power for a particular level. The  
damage of each quickening is simply summed up at the end to produce the total
damage.

Note that regular quickening hits only damage the target enemy.

Also, certain enemies can reduce damages received, including Quickening
damages.

______________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[7d. Damage: Finishing Blow]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have enough quickening hits of different levels to meet a certain
criteria, there can be a special finishing blow, or concurrence. All finishing
blows has a radius of 10, so it also damages enemies close to the target. It
would be risky to perform a Quickening on a group of tough enemies, though,
since only the concurrence targets multiple targets in range.

The Official (Brady) Guide covers the Finishing Blow criteria pretty well, but
made a mistake by switching the places of Whiteout and Luminescence. The  
correct criteria are listed below.

 ================================================
| Name                POW    REQ: Lv1  Lv2  Lv3  |
|------------------------------------------------|
| Black Hole          253          4    4    4   |
| Luminescence        251          3    3    3   |
| Ark Blast           205          2    2    2   |
| White Out           175                    5   |
| Windburst           155               5        |
| Torrent             130          2    3        |
| Cataclysm           110          7             |
| Inferno              90          3             |
 ================================================

Although these attacks appear to be elemental, they are still physical damages.
The higher up on the list, the higher priority is given. For example, if both
Black Hole and White Out is possible, then Black Hole takes place.

The actual damage of a Finishing Blow is:

 -----------------
| POW x Lv(enemy) |
 -----------------

For example, for a level 99 enemy, a Black Hole alone would deal a damage of
253 x 99, not including the individual Quickening hits before.

o Extra Info: Scoring insanely high hits in Quickening
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ultimania guide included a picture of a 47-hit level-1 Quickening. It is
said that it is made possible by:

1) Purchase only 1 Quickening license
2) Acquire an Esper that requires 3 Mist Cartridges to summon (Famfrit, Chaos,
   Ultima or Zodiark).

8. Monsters

______________________________________________________________________________
Final Fantasy XII: Zone Another Way ==========================================

Hopefully now you have a pretty good idea about how our own party characters
function. In this section, I will cover some extra information about monsters,
starting with their special abilities.

______________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[8a. Passive Abilities]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some monsters' passive abilities are equivalent to a few accessories we put
on the characters. Some others look similar to our augment licenses. The only
difference is that the monsters can cheat - they are not limited to one
accessory. Yiazmat carries 8 passive abilities to start, while Omega MKXII has
21 !

Now let's take a look at them. I tried my best to translate the names, but
there might be another official English translation. On the last column I
will list the accessory, license or equipment that has the same effect.

[A] = Accessory
[L] = License
[E] = Equipment (Armor/Helm)

Just for your information, I have marked the following tough bosses' special
ability within the table.

Yiazmat: [Y]
Omega MKXII: [O]
Zodiark: [Z]
Hell Wyrm: [W]

Also, if you see a star "*" that follows, this special ability is triggered
later, usually when the boss's HP drops under a certain threshold.

Note: Thanks Split Infinity to correct me about the White Wind effect.

By the way, Split Inifinity's FAQ has a complete list of Monster's active
ability (actions). For example, you can see that Zodiark's Darkja inflict
50% Instant K.O.


o Nihopalona + Hi-Ether
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Much thanks to Master ZED who brought up the idea - you can use "Nihopalona + 
Hi-Ether" to drain out tough monster's MP, if they do not have the MP
consumption = 0 ability. Zodiark is one example.

Much thanks to preeelude, who quickly tested this trick, and proved that it
indeed works. After MP depletion, Zodiark could only do physical attacks.
However, when Zodiark's HP gets low (starting at HP < 80%), it will use a
"Mana Spring" ability, making all MP consumption = 0.

8b. Spawning
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's take a look at how monsters spawn in FF12.

o Special conditions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Many monsters spawn only when a special condition is fulfilled. Here is a list
of common special conditions and the best way to spawn these monsters. The
term "zone" will be used as a verb:

      Zone: leave and re-enter this area
 Zone once: go 1 zone away (the neighboring zone), and come back.
Zone twice: go 2 zones away, and come back.

[A] With a XX% when entering the zone.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy: This is the eaiset. Zone once, and do it multiple times in a row.
Examples: Bombshell, Bull Croc

[B] During XX weather
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy: Zone once, or in some cases enter from a totally different area.
Examples: Entites, Fafnir

[C1] When XX monster is defeated
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy: What do you say? Defeat that monster.
Examples: Aeroes

[C2] When XX type monster is defeated, each time
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy: Defeat all monsters of that type and check. If nothing shows up,
          zone twice and kill again!
Examples: Ripe Rampager, Spee

[C3] When all monsters in the area is defeated
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy: Kill them all, friendly or not. However, in some cases monsters
          respawn (see below) and you have to keep killing until they stop.
Examples: Behemoth King, Etherian

[D] Replaces XX enemy with a XX%
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy: Take a quick look. If you don't see any, zone twice or reload.
Examples: Bangaa, Seeq, Agent Smith

[E] Stay in the zone(s), or anywhere in the entire area over XX time
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy: Do it. In some cases your chance increases when you stay longer.
Examples: Ishteen, Negalmuur

[F] When the game clock has a Minute number between XX and XX
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy: Check your in-game clock.
Examples: Killbug, Grey Moler

[G] When (XX type of) chain number reaches XX number
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy: You often need more chain number than the specified amount. Keep
          chaining and it will eventually appear. You can chain any monster if
          it is not specified, but usually there is one abundant type nearby.
Examples: Barmuu, Tarasque

[H] When one party member's HP drops below XX%
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy: Usually it is 10%. Note that critical HP status is 20%, so you may
          need to hurt yourself more.
Examples: Dustia, Velelu

There are still other rare spawning conditions. See section 8c for details.


o Suddenly appear
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While most monsters spawn (appear on the screen) when you are close enough to
see them, some monsters spawn all of a sudden, such as jumping out of water
(fish & frog), bursting out from the ground (zombie), dropping down from above
(flans), and "fading into existence". In the last case, these monsters spawn
with the "vanish" status, making them not obviously visible until they turn
aggressive. Keep this in mind when you are hunting rare monsters, as you might
have to get to the exact spot to make them appear.

o 6 monster limit
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In most zones of FF12, there is a 6-monster-max limit. This means that no more
than 6 monsters can co-exist at the same time. This is usually the reason that
you have fulfilled the spawning condition, but you still get no spawn -- you
have to kill some other monsters to make room for your target to show up.

There are a few exceptions of this 6-monster limit, where a different limit is
set.

o Respawn
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are 3 conditions for monsters in a given zone to COMPLETELY respawn:

 (1) Move two zones away (obviously)
 (2) Move one zone away, and come back after 5 minutes
 (3) Load game

Monsters also respawn even if you stay in the same area. This process takes
2-3 minutes, and a monster could respawn between 0 to 2 times.

This may be useful when you are trying to kill a certain regular monster that
does not spawn very frequently (such as Bangaas and Seeqs). After killing
them for the first time, stick around for a few minutes to kill them at the
same spot again.

Rare Monsters only respawn when you fulfill one of the three "completely
respawn" criteria.

By the way, a monster will not regain its stolen item, unless you respawn
them. There is one exception -- when you steal from an inactive (green bar)
monster, you only need to zone once to make them go back to the inactive
status, and their item is restored as well (to be stolen by you again). See
section 4a for more details and tricks.

o Only one each time?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following monsters will only show up ONCE in the entire area (usually with
multiple zones), even if it could spawn in multiple zones and spots. To get
the next one you have to respawn the entire area. See 8c for details. 

[Zone specific]:
 014, 088, 090, 105, 135, 205

[With a low chance (like rare monster)]:
 159, 210, 375

[Weather specific]:
 006, 017, 019, 071, 096, 098, 120, 133, 137, 172, 188

[Timer specific]:
 027, 049

[Other torturing conditions]:
 026, 070, 149, 151, 153, 155, 157, 168


o Zone & Respawn Trick for Teleporting Monsters
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you kill a teleporting monster (such as Dustia), you can rapidly spawn
them again if you leave the current zone before their death animation is
over (and LP / EXP numbers pop out), and come back. If the teleporting monster
chases across the zone then you don't really need to come back, but if you do
you will get yet another spawn in the original zone.

The trick is useful if you want to build up a otherwise-impossible chain to
farm Dustia for (High) Arcana and Helvinek for Grand Armor.

However, it is tricky to grab their loot AND to leave the zone in about one
second. Their falling body is usually big enough to block your access to the
loot bag & coin. However, if you approach them from their "side", you should
be able to take the loot during the animation.

This trick only works for teleporting monsters (those who shows colorful
illusions before materializing). Also, it has nothing to do with whether a
monster can chase you across the zone. Even if they do, feel free to kill
them on both sides. As long as you exit the zone in time, they will spawn
again.

Another important note is your party leader might get stuck in a stun if he
or she is performing some long-stun-time actions just before the monster is
killed. This stun may cost you the chain. To make sure you get things rolling
smoothly, don't activate those stun-prone gambit actions on your party leader.

Note that you should be able to collect enough High Arcana without even
trying (as long as you didn't sell them all at once). Grand Armor is not as
effective as many other easy-to-get alternatives (see Appendix B). I include
this only because this is a special phenomenon of spawning mechanics.

[8c. Bestiary FAQ]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here I will extract interesting information, such as spawning method, steal,
drop, and poach chances, from selected bestiary monsters.

The format goes like this:

[Where] Where (but not only where) can this monster be found
[Spawn] How to spawn the monster. See Section 8b for strategies.
[Steal] Chance (without / with Thief's Cuff acc.)
[Drops] Chance (with Chain Level 0/1/2/3, or Monograph, Canopic Jar)
[Poach] Chance

[Trophy] = Trophy Monster, 1 only. Non-trophy rare monsters can spawn again
as long as the condition is fulfilled.

There are 7 monographs in total. If you are not sure which category (beast,
undead, etc.) the monster belongs, just buy all monographs. There are good,
other FAQs covering this.

Note that by showing you the exact probabilities listed in the Ultimania
guide, I am actually trying to discourage you from some sadistically-tedious
gameplay. However, if you insist on jumping in because you find it fun, the
information below may give you a good expectation of how much time you will be
wasting, and hopefully reduce it significantly.
     
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
004 Wide Saurian
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Dalmasca Estersand - The Stepping
[Drops] Super Low (1/2/3/5%): Bone Helm
        Monograph (12%): Tyrant Bone
[Poach] Low (5%): Tyrant Bone

Note: The Bone Mail (also 1%) is dropped by those north of the river.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
006 Gnoma Entite
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Dalmasca Westersand (2 zones)
[Spawn] Only appears only during Sandstorm. You can easily see it outside
        the exit of Zertinan Cavern when the weather is correct.
[Steal] Low (3/6): Gnoma Halcyon
[Drops] Low (3/6/8/12%): Gnoma Halcyon

Note: Better go for it before defeating the Earth Tyrant, as sandstorm becomes
      very rare afterwards.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
007 Dive Talon
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Dalmasca Estersand
[Drops] Super Low (1/2/3/5%): Burning Bow

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
013 Silicon Tortoise
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Giza Plain - Tracks of the Beast (Rain)
[Steal] Low (3/6%): Officer's Hat
[Drops] Mid (25/30/35/40%): Water Crystal

Note: Officer's Hat is a nice Light helm for this stage of the game. Water
      Crystals are ingredients for Ame-no-Murakumo, a popular and the 3rd
      best Katana.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
014 Wildsnake
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Giza Plain - Toam Hills (Dry)
[Steal] High (55/80%): Snake Skin
[Drops] High (40/45/50/55%): Snake Skin
        Low (3/6/8/12%): Snake Skin
[Poach] High (95%): Snake skin

Note: It is very hard to miss the Snake Skins (ingredient for Tournesol, one
      of the best weapons) on the Wildsnakes, even though there is only one
      snake per spawn.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
015 Werewolf
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Giza Plain - Starfall Hills (Dry)
[Drops] Super Low (1/2/3/5%): Kotetsu

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
019 Mardu Entite (Elemental/Entite)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] The Giza Plain (rain) -  Toam Hills
[Spawn] Spawns only during a heavy-rain weather. There must be lightning in
        the sky.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
027 Water Elemental (Elemental)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] The Garamsythe Waterway (3 zones), Necrohol of Nabudis 
[Spawn] In the Garamsythe Waterway, it appears when you have spent 10 in-game
        minutes in the Waterway area (zoning from one sub-area to another is
        fine). In Necrohol of Nabudis it appears with the Chaos Esper.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
049 Gazer (Reaper)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] The Lushu Mines (3 zones)
[Spawn] This one is rarer than rare monsters. Stay inside one of the 3 zones:
        The Shunia Twinspan, Site 2, Site 3 for more than 7 minutes. It spawns
        right beside the party.

Note: One spot for sure works is the south-most room in Site 3 (beside the
      zone exit to Site 2). Just leave your controller idle for 7 minutes.
      After killing one, it seems no more will spawn in any of the three
      zones, so you have to return to the orange save crystal, save, and load.

      You need a total of 5 to complete the entry, which means 35 minutes of
      doing nothing, plus extra running. That's very fun gameplay, eh?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
055 Salamand Entite (Elemental/Entite)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] The Ogir-Yensa Sandsea (2 zones)
[Spawn] Spawns only during a sunny weather, in the middle and mid-north area.
        It is quite hard to find it as there are lots of visual obstacles.
[Steal] Low (3/6%): Salamand Halcyon
[Drops] Low (3/6/8/12%): Salamand Halcyon

Note: Salamand Halcyon is an ingredient for the 2nd best gun, Arcturus. Since
      you can get the best gun rather early, I don't recommend wasting time
      on stealing it from this powerful Entite. If you insist on trying, see
      Section 4a for tips on how to steal quickly and safely.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
065-F Lv99 Red Chocobo
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Ozmone Plain - Haulo Green
[Spawn] You need to fulfill a few conditions: (1) obtained Treaty Blade, (2)
        defeated more than 6 chocobos on Ozmone Plains. Then, this ultra-rare
        monster appears with a chance of 1/256.
[Drops] Always (100%): Ribbon
        Monograph (90%): Gemsteel
        Canopic Jar (90%): High Arcana

Note: You can get a free Ribbon in Pharos. All chocobos belong to the same
      bestiary entry (065) , so you do not have to defeat this one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
070 Hybrid Gator
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Ozmone Plain - 4 zones
[Spawn] Depends on the "Minute" number of your in-game clock, this one can
        spawn in one of the four zones:
        00-14: The Switchback
        15-29: Dagan Flats
        30-44: Field of Light Winds
        45-59: The Greensnake (the long winding road with lots of Wus)

Note: Once the time comes, you have to respawn the entire zone (2 zones or
      reload) for the croc to appear. Also, the croc might not be there as
      soon as you enter, as there can only be 6 monsters at any given time.
      Kill some and look again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
071 Sylphi Entite (Elemental/Entite)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] The Ozmone Plain (2 zones)
[Spawn] Spawns only during a cloudy weather, in Haulo Green and Field of Light
        Winds. It is easier to spawn them in the Haulo Green as it is just
        outside the Jahara orange save crystal, and you can ride a cheap
        chocobo to take a quick look.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
084 Etem (Reaper)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] The Henne Mines - secret area
[Steal] Low (3/6%): Soul Powder
[Drops] Monograph (10%): Soul Powder

Note: Soul Powder is an ingredient for Tournesol.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
098 Leshach Entite (Elemental/Entite)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Paramina Rift (2 zones)
[Spawn] Spawns only during a blizzard weather, in Head of the Silverflow and
        Icebound Flow. It is easier to spawn them in Icebound Flow as you
        can repeatedly zone in from Feywood until you get a blizzard.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
114 Humbaba (Giant/Behemoth)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] The Mosphoran Highwaste
[Drops] Monograph (8%): Beastlord Horn

Note: Beastlord Horn is an ingredient for the best bow, Sagittarius Bow.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
116 Ash Wyrn (Dragon/Fell Wyrm)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] The Mosphoran Highwaste, The Great Crystal
[Spawn] In the Mosphoran Highwaste, it spawns at the same spot as Exodus after
        you have defeated this Esper. It is also seen in various locations in
        the Great Crystal (secret area).
[Drops] Monograph (10%): Moon Ring

Note: Moon Ring is an ingredient for the best bow, Sagittarius Bow.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
120 Fire Elemental (Elemental)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] The Mosphoran Highwaste (2 zones), Necrohol of Nabudis 
[Spawn] In the Mosphoran Highwaste, it appears in Summit Path and Trail of
        Sky-flung Stone, during a sunny weather. In Necrohol of Nabudis it
        appears with the Chaos Esper.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
133 Air Elemental (Elemental)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Phon Coast (2 zones), Necrohol of Nabudis 
[Spawn] In Phon Coast, it appears in Pora-Pora Sands and Limatra Hills during
        a rainy weather. In Necrohol of Nabudis it appears with the Chaos
        Esper.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
137 Earth Elemental (Elemental)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Tchita Uplands (2 zones), Necrohol of Nabudis 
[Spawn] In Tchita Uplands, it appears in Realm of the Elder Dream and Sundered
        Earth zones, during a cloudy weather. In Necrohol of Nabudis it spawns
        with the Chaos Esper.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
146 Cerberus (Wolf)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Feywood - area north of the blue save crystal
[Spawn] 40% chance to replace any Tartarus.
[Drops] Monograph (5%): Hell-Gate's Flame
[Poach] Low (5%): Hell Gate's Flame

Note: Hell-Gate's Flame is an ingredient for Tournesol. Farming is easier
      by just killing them if you have the right monograph.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
149 Mandragora Prince (Mandragora)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] (Other than the boss fight) Feywood - Icefield of Clear Sight
[Spawn] Defeat all monsters in the area (may take a while as monsters tend to
        respawn for a few minutes), zone once. After defeating them, zone out
        (two this time, to the north is the fastest route) to spawn the next
        batch.

Note: These Mandragoras travel between the four shrines, not necessarily
      together. Sometimes you can detect them from far away when they buff
      themselves.

      Same goes for 151, 153, 155 and 157. To fulfill the bestiary requirement
      you need to kill them 14 times here... This may be your most boring
      moment of FF12. Well, actually there are at least 10 other candidates.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
150 Basilisk (Serpent)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Feywood (3 zones south of the blue crystal, especially abundant in
        The Edge of Reason)
[Drops] Super Low (1/2/3/5%): Serpent Eye
        Monograph (8%): Serpent Eye

Note: Serpent Eye is an ingredient for Tournesol.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
159 Holy Elemental (Elemental)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] The Feywood (3 zones)
[Spawn] Spawns with a 20% chance when party enters Feywood's 3 northern zones,

Note: Multiple zonings at the boundary work well. In Walk of Dancing Shadow
      (Mirror Knight zone), in spawns in the middle-south region. There is 
      only ONE in all three areas each time.
        
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
172 Daikon Entite (Elemental/Entite)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] The Ancient City of Giruvegan - The Trimahala / Aadha Water-steps
[Spawn] Spawns during a "foggy" weather.

Note: It is a little hard to tell "foggy" from "clear" as the fogs here are
      merely traces of floating illusions. Zone a few times at the entrance
      with the waystone, until you can see a "heavier fog" which shouldn't
      take more than several attempts. Then, have a run through both areas.
      It spawns on your way to the exit, so there is no need to search the
      entire zones.

      Same with all other Entites, there is only one to be found for the
      entire area. You will have to re-enter to get a second. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
178 Magick Pot (Fiend, Magical Creature)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Pharos-Subterra
[Steal] Low (3/6%) Elixir
[Drops] Always (100%) Ether
        Super Low (1/2/3/5%) Mega-Elixir

Note: This monster is extremely powerful unless you feed it an Elixir, which
      makes it very vulnerable and keeps running around. You can steal the
      Elixir back afterwards. If you insist on killing it without giving an
      Elixir, you can use techs that ignores target DEF (as its DEF and MDEF
      is 255), such as Telekinesis. (Thanks to Drew Gibson).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
188 Undin Entite (Elemental/Entite)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Cerebi Steppe / Pharos
[Spawn] In Cerebi Steppe, it spawns in two different zones (close to the blue
        save crystal) during a rainy weather. In Pharos, it spawns in two
        zones of the First and Second Ascent with a 30% chance when the party
        enters the zones.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
203 Leynir (Undead/Sleipnir)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Nabudis Deadland - north of the orange save crystal
[Drops] Monograph (5%): Wargod's Band
[Poach] Low (5%): Wargod's Band

Note: Wargod's Band is an ingredient for Tournesol. Poaching is far less
      effective than killing, if you have the correct Monograph.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
205 Leamonde Entite (Elemental/Entite)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Nabudis Deadland - south of the orange save crystal
[Spawn] Requires heavy fog.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
206 Foobar (Amorph/Flan)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Nabudis Deadland - many zones.
[Spawn] You can find them easily in the area just west of the Necrohol exit,
        which is NE of the orange save crystal.
[Steal] Mid (10/30%): Sagittarius Gem.

Note: Sagittarius Gem is an ingredient for the best bow, Sagittarius Bow.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
207 Oversoul (Reaper)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Necrohol of Nabudis
[Spawn] Spawns after you defeat (subsequently) 20, 15, 10, 5, 3 and 1 enemies
        in Necrohol. There are six in total per visit, but it is possible to
        get more, as it is a teleporting monster (see the end of Section 8b).
[Drops] Monograph (6%): Soul of Thamasa

Note: After all six Oversouls are defeated, the rare monster Helvinek (367)
      appears.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
210 Dark Elemental (Elemental)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Necrohol of Nabudis - Hall of the Ivory Covenant (and another)
[Spawn] 20% to spawn when you enter the area.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
223 Lindwyrm (Hunt Mark)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Tchita Uplands - Garden of Life's Circle
[Spawn] Spawns during a cloudy weather. There will not be any other monster
        in the area when it spawns. To get a cloudy weather you have to enter
        the entire Tchita Upland area with the weather already cloudy / rainy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
224 Ring Wyrm (Hunt Mark)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Dalmasca Westersand - Windtrace Dunes
[Spawn] Spawns during a sandstorm weather.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
228 Marilith (Hunt Mark)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Zertinan Caverns - Invitation to Heresy
[Spawn] Spawns at the SE corner, in the sun-lit area. You have to spend more
        than 5 in-game minutes in this area for the monster to spawn.

Note: I have heard people saying that the monster never spawns after waiting
      for far more than 5 minutes. The only logical explanation I have is
      there are already 6 monsters in the area, thus blocking the appearance
      of the 7th.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
229 Deathscythe (Hunt Mark)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Necrohol of Nabudis - Cloister of the Highborn
[Spawn] Appears when a party member's HP drops below 10% of MAX. Note that
        Critical HP is only 20%, so you have to hit yourself harder.

Note: Anthony Whyte wrote to me that he actually spawned Deathscythe with
      nearly full HP but 0 MP.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
231 Deathgaze (Hunt Mark)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deathgaze is the hunt mark in "Visitor on Deck". After speaking to the boy who
posted the request, this mark has a 4% chance to appear in your next airship
travel. When you take a flight to your next destination, if the mark does not
show up, and you speak to the boy again, your chance to encounter this mark on
your next flight doubles.

Your chance keeps doubling until 64%.

When I did it, I always chose the "private flight" option, so I can talk
to the boy again and again. When the mark showed up for me, the boy actually
"teleported" me to a flying airship to fight it! Of course, you can choose the
conventional way -- choosing the "leisure flight" to look for it yourself.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
241 Fafnir (Hunt Mark)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Paramina Rift - Silverflow's End
[Spawn] The weather has to be "blizzard" (very heavy snowstorm). To keep the
        blizzard going you have to get a blizzard at the moment you enter the
        entire Paramina Rift area, and keep the blizzard all the way to the
        target area. There are two parts of the Silverflow's End. Fafnir is
        in the smaller, isolated NW area.

        The easiest way is:
        From Feywood -> Icebound Flow (make sure you get a Blizzard weather)
        -> Frozen Brook -> Karydine Glacier -> Silverflow's End

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
243 Pylraster (Hunt Mark)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Pharos-First Ascent - They Who Thirst Not
[Spawn] Just outside the area with the orange save crystal.
[Steal] Mid (10/30%): Tyrant Bone

Note: This is the easiest way to obtain Tyrant Bone (since you are very close
      to a save crystal), ingredient for the best non-elemental Gun Ammo,
      Stone Shot.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
245 Cluckatrice (Elite Hunt Mark)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Giza Plains - Gizas North Bank (Dry)
[Spawn] Defeat all monsters in the area, zone out and back in.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
247 Orthos (Elite Hunt Mark)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Garamscythe Waterway - Southern Sluiceway
[Spawn] Appears at the center only if all 3 party members are female. You can
        switch them out after it spawns.

Note: Larsa is a girl and Reddas has his pink panties, so they are fine. :-)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
248 Gil Snapper (Elite Hunt Mark)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Giza Plains - Tracks of the Beast
[Spawn] Appears during Heavy Rain weather. Your NPC fellow hunter will tell
        you when it appears.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
249 Trickster (Elite Hunt Mark)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Paramina Rift - Icebound Flow
[Spawn] Appears 30% of the time when visiting the area. Your NPC fellow hunter
        will tell you when it appears.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
251 Carrot (Elite Hunt Mark)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] The Salikawood - Sun-dappled Path
[Spawn] Appears when no monster has been defeated since the party enters the
        entire Salikawood area (this time).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
254 Behemoth King (Elite Hunt Mark)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] The Feywood - The Edge of Reason
[Spawn] Appears when all monsters in "The Edge of Reason" and the "Icefield of
        Clearsight" are defeated. May take a few trips to get rid off all of
        the respawns, which will stop eventually.

Note: People have been debating whether getting rid off the little fruit mobs
      (149-157) is necessary. If you see them, kill them. I got the King to
      spawn without seeing the fruit mobs at all, though.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
255 Ixion (Elite Hunt Mark)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Pharos-Subterra - Penumbra-Interior
[Spawn] May appear in multiple zones. The spawn chance increases by 6% every
        12 seconds the party stays in a given area.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] [Trophy] 293 Aspidochelon (Adamantitan)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Cerobi Steppe - Feddik River
[Spawn] 40% chance to replace an existing Admantitan (3 in this area).
[Steal] Low (3/6%): Scarletite (ingredient for Tournesol)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 294 Aerieel (Vampyr)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Lhusu Mines - Ottam Span
[Spawn] 20% chance to appear while entering this area.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] [Trophy] 295 Thalassinon (Emeralditan)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Phon Coast - The Vaddu Strand
[Spawn] Stand on the high edge above the cliff for 10 seconds to watch it
        spawn below.

Note: This is the beginning of all Trophy rare game hunts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] [Trophy] 296 Anybus (Abysteel)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Sochen Cave Palace - Mirror of the Soul
[Spawn] In the room with the one-chance chest of Koga/Iga blade. To access
        this room you have to follow a specific path to alter the waterfall
        pattern. The path is described in many guides including Brady.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 297 Greeden (Gator)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Dalmasca Estersand - Banks of the Nebra
[Spawn] Once entering this area, leave all Cactoid enemies alive for 3 minutes,
        and this monster spawns close to the shore.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 298 Barmuu (Facer)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] The Tomb of Raithwall - Royal Passage
[Spawn] Appears at the center of the teleport platform when chaining 11 or
        more Seekers (bat).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 299 Bull Croc (Feral Croc)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Ozmone Plain - The Shred
[Spawn] 20% chance to spawn while entering the area. Kill the Wus just to
        make sure they don't block the spawn when you zone back.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 300 Vishno (Deidar)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] The Pharos First Ascent - Wellspring Ravel - 4th Flight
[Spawn] Defeat more than 10 Deidars, and it spawns at the southern edge just
        before entering the next area (Horizon's Break). This spot is usually
        occupied by an Aeronite.

[Drops] Super Low (1/2/3/5%): Ribbon

Note: Yet another way to get a Ribbon, but rather inefficiently. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] [Trophy] 301 Gavial (Baritine Croc)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Garamscythe Waterway - No. 10 Channel
[Spawn] Release the No. 10 water gate to access the larger lower area in the
        west. Wait for 10 seconds and this one rushes in!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 302 Etherian (Flan)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Cerobi Steppe - The Northsward
[Spawn] Defeat all monsters in this area. The monsters will respawn for quite
        some time before it's finally over.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 303 Wary Wolf (Wolf)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Mosphoran Highwaste - Summit Path
[Spawn] 5 possible spawn spots. Replaces any Worgen enemy with a 7% chance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] [Trophy] 304 Melt (Hecteyes)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Henne Mines - Pithead Junction B
[Spawn] 50% chance to spawn when entering this little Jelly switch area. Even
        when it spawns, you can't see it unless you pull the red/blue switch
        to make it appear. If you see Jelly drop, mop them up and zone out and
        in for several times, and pull the switch again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] [Trophy] 305 Kaiser Wolf (Silver Lobo)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Dalmasca Westersand - Corridor of Sand
[Spawn] Travel all the way around to the E-S corner. Spawns only after the
        Lindbur Wolf (307) has just been spawned and defeated.

Note: I spawn it while keeping the wolve chain from the Lindbur Wolf, not
      killing anything else in between. I am not sure whether it is necessary,
      though.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 306 Cubus (Construct)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Sochen Cave Palace - Temptation Eluded
[Spawn] While entering this area, there is a 25% chance that the enemies are
        Windigos and Pit Fiends (i.e. NOT Strikers and Imps). Defeat them and
        this pile of mud drops right beside the party.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 307 Lindbur Wolf (Worgen)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Dalmasca Westersand - Shimmering Horizon (Brady Guide is wrong)
[Spawn] Spawns after chaining more than 20 wolves.
[Steal] Low (3/6%): Gladius

Note: Gladius is a very good wind-element dagger that can be obtained early.
      The wolf uses its devastating soundwave attack everytime you re-enter,
      so "stay and steal" is less MP-demanding.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 308 Pineapple (Bomb)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Ogir-Yensa Sandsea - Platform 1 - Refinery
[Spawn] 20% chance to spawn while entering the area. There are 6 possible
        spawn spots all over the place. If you don't see it, zone a few times
        and check all over again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] [Trophy] 309 Dreadguard (Mirror Knight)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] The Feywood - Wall of the Dancing Shadow
[Spawn] Spawns in the middle of the area, 40% to replace a Mirror Knight.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 310 Bombshell (Grenade)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Lhusu Mines - Lasche Span (south segment)
[Spawn] 20% chance to spawn while entering the area. If you don't see it, zone
        a few times and check again.
[Drops] Low (3/6/8/12%): Yagyu Darkblade

Note: Yagyu Darkblade (+80) is the best Ninja Sword in the game. However, it
      is completely useless except against Yiazmat. While at chain level 1,
      you have a 50% chance to get no blade at all after 22 kills.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 311 Crypt Bunny (Dreamhare)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] The Feywood - Walk of Stolen Truths
[Spawn] 20% chance to spawn ONLY IF more than 6 Cerberus AND All Tartarus have
        been defeated. There are 6 spawning locations all over the place.
        Just defeat everything and walk around. If there is no spawn, zone
        twice and try again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 312 Megabomb (Balloon)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Nam-Yensa Sandsea - Demesne of the Sandqueen
[Spawn] 7 possible spawn spots all over the place. Appears when chain number
        reaches 21 or more. Chaining "the sand people" works well.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 313 Spee (Dreamhare)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] The Salikawood - Sun-dapped Path
[Spawn] 15% chance to spawn when a Wyrdhare is defeated, but only shows up
        when the party gets close. There are 3 possible spawn sites, all dead
        ends. If you see nothing after defeating all Wyrdhares, zone twice
        and try again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 314 Matriarch Bomb (Grenade)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Stilshrine of Miriam
[Spawn] Access the hidden area from below (Ward of the Sword-King, where you
        spawn 340 Negalmuur), climb all the way to the top (watch out for the
        deadly trap). It has a 20% chance to replace any of the Oilings there.

Note: To access the hidden stairs from below, walk along the west wall, and
      the hidden stair will show up when you get past it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 315 Rain Dancer (Danbania)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Giza Plains (Rain) - 3 zones
[Spawn] It can appear at a total of 11 possible spots, in the zones just
        west of the village (Toam Hills), just east of the south blue crystal,
        and the NW zone. It spawns with a 20% chance while entering the zones.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 316 Ripe Rampager (Mandragora)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Dalmasca Estersand - Yardang Labyrinth
[Spawn] Just south the SW zone exit. 33% chance to spawn when defeating
        Cacite & Cactoid enemies. If you have defeated all four Cacites /
        Cactoids and don't have a spawn there, zone twice and try again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 317 Razorfin (Piranha)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Garamscythe Waterway - North Spur Sluiceway
[Spawn] There is a 10% chance that this rare monster replaces any of the
        Ichthon enemy in this area. If you have killed all Ichthons without
        seeing it, you will have to zone twice to reset this area. This one is
        the weakest rare monster among all.

Note: You can still access this area later in the game.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] [Trophy] 318 Killbug (Mimic)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Ozmone Plains - The Switchback
[Spawn] It is a mimic, so it appears as a chest. It only spawns when your Play
        Time (in-game clock) has a Minute number between 10 and 39.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 319 Apsara (Piranha)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Phon Coast - The Mauleia Strand
[Spawn] Spawns at the coast on the southern tip of this area, when you chain
        more than 10 Piranha. In my game, I couldn't get it spawned until I
        chained 17 Piranha. In another attempt I had it with a 12 Piranha
        chain. The monster will be visible from a distance when spawned.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 320 Minibug (Tiny Mimic)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Barheim Passage - East-West Bypass
[Spawn] At very eastern end where Mimic chests are located. 20% chance to
        spawn when entering the area. It does not pretend to be a chest.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] [Trophy] 321 Rageclaw (Mantis)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] The Salikawood - Piebald Path
[Spawn] Spawns at either the western or the southern end, only when no monster
        has been defeated / eaten (by another monster) within 1 minute since
        entering the area. You can kill all monsters first, and zone back in
        to make the criteria easier to fulfill.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 322 Ithuno (Mimic)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Barheim Passage, Special Op Sector 5
[Spawn] 20% spawn chance when entering the area. It appears as a chest close
        to the west-end, just beside a medium-sized rock along the northern
        wall.
[Steal] Low (3/6%): Deathbringer (1-H sword, 10% instant death)

Note: The famous supplier of the very useful 1-H sword, available quite early
      in the game.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] [Trophy] 323 Biding Mantis (Preying Mantis)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Golmore Jungle - The Needlebrake
[Spawn] Spawns in four possible locations, when the in-game clock has a Minute
        number between 30 and 59.

Note: Brady guide misses this one in its Hunt Club section. So if you only
      have 29 trophies and think you should have got them all, check out this
      Mantis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] [Trophy] 324 Kris (Malboro)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Tchita Uplands - The Highlands
[Spawn] Spawns at either the NW or SE section, 40% chance when entering the
        area.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 325 Wood Toad (Toad)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] The Salikawood, Corridor of Ages
[Spawn] 20% chance to spawn while entering the area. It has a "vanish" status.
        If it spawns you can hear it walking, and see its shadow if you look
        carefully. You can make it appear by reflecting an aggressive spell
        off yourself.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] [Trophy] 326 Dheed (Plate Wyvern)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Mosphoran Highwaste - Skyreach Ridge
[Spawn] Spawns with a 40% chance when entering, just south of the Esper area.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 327 Tarasque (Toad)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Tchita Uplands - Garden of Life's Circle
[Spawn] Spawns at the northern edge, when chain number reaches 21 or more. You
        can chain the serpents in the same zone. Note that the frog won't jump
        out of the creek until you get close.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 328 Aeros (Aeronite)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Ozmone Plains - The Shred
[Spawn] Spawns after defeating the Bull Croc (299) rare enemy.
[Steal] Low (3/6%): Wyvern Wing

Note: Wyvern Wing is an ingredient for the 2nd best gun, Arcturus. By the way,
      you can get the best gun, Fomalhaut quite soon after this.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] [Trophy] 329 Grimalkin (Coeurl)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Tchita Uplands - Uazcuff Hills
[Spawn] 6 possible spawn spots all over the place, with a 10% chance to
        replace a Coeurl enemy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] [Trophy] 330 Terror Tyrant (Tyrant)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Dalmasca Estersand - Broken Sands
[Spawn] Replaces a Wild Saurian with 40% chance, at the center of this zone.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 331 Nekhbet (Cockatrice)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Dalmasca Estersand - Sand-swept Naze
[Spawn] Three possible spawn points: very west, center, and very east of the
        area. Defeat the Cockatrice enemy in this area, and this monster
        spawns with a 20% chance. If you have defeated all Cocktrices in this
        area and don't have a spawn, zone twice and try again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] [Trophy] 332 Abelisk (Tyrant)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Ridorana Cataract - Echoes from Time's Garden
[Spawn] Spawns with a 30% chance in the middle, when you enter the area.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 333 Glaring Eye (Necrophobe)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Henne Mines - Crossover C & Phase 2 Shaft
[Spawn] 6 possible spawn spots, with 10% chance to appear when you defeat a
        Hecteyes enemy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 334 Dustia (Oversoul)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Dalmasca Westersand - Corridor of Sand
[Spawn] Appears as soon as one party member has less than 10% of MAX HP.
[Drops] Monograph (30%): Arcana
        Canopic Jar (5%): High Arcana

Note: Most rare monsters drop Arcana (30%) and High Arcana (5%), with the
      appropriate monograph and the Canopic Jar, respectively. I just list
      it here as many guides mention farming them from this rare monster.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 335 Cultsworn Lich (Lich)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] The Tomb of Raithwall - Southfall Passage
[Spawn] 20% chance to spawn from a Lich "division". To make a Lich divide,
        or multiply, bring down their health (but don't kill them).

Note: This one can take quite a while if you are unlucky. First, you can kill
      Vossler (if he is with you) since he will probably kill your "Lich farm"
      accidentally. You can silence the Lich to avoid its Oil + Fire combo. 
      If a regular Lich is spawned, you can manually order all party members
      to kill it. Your Lich farm will eventually stop dividing (and keep 
      hitting you, which is very annoying). If this happens, zone out and start
      from fresh!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] [Trophy] 336 Ishteen (Reaper)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Barheim Passage - The East-West Span & The Zeviah Span
[Spawn] When you first visit the zones, it has a 2% chance to spawn. The spawn
        chance increases by 2% for every subsequent 10 seconds you stay in the
        area. Spawns beside the party.
[Steal] Low (3/6%): Soul of Thamasa

Note: Soul of Thamasa can be converted to High Arcana through Bazaar. When I
      spawned Ishteen, I zoned back and forth between the two zones, and
      actually made it appear in both, stealing one Soul of Thamasa from each.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 337 Evil Spirit (Necrofiend)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] The Great Crystal - 8 possible spawn locations.
[Spawn] It has a 5% chance to replace a Forbidden enemy. So basically
        whenever you see a lot of Forbiddens, you might get the Evil Spirit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] [Trophy] 338 Vorres (Gazer)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Necrohol of Nabudis - Hall of the Ivory Covenant
[Spawn] Two possible spawn sites, directly NW and SW (quite close) to the Fury
        room. You have to lure a Dark Elemental (210) to either "room" to make
        it appear. To lure a Dark Elemental around, travel just outside of its
        spell range, and it will follow you.
[Steal] Low (3/6): Soul Powder

Note: Soul Powder is an ingredient of Tournesol. Alternatively, you can kill
      Etems (084) in Henne mines secret area later. The good news is you only
      need one more, as you can get the rest from Montblanc (clan rank & 
      Esper reward).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 339 Juggernaut (Golem)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] The Feywood - White Magick's Embrace
[Spawn] Only spawns when the Minute number on your in-game clock is between 0
        and 10.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 340 Negalmuur (Nightwalker)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Stilshrine of Miriam - Ward of the Sword-King
[Spawn] You have to fulfill two conditions. (1) Stay in the Stilshrine for
        more than 30 minutes (real-time), and (2) Defeat the Darkmare (blue
        horse) monster.

Note: This is the famous auto-level monster.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 341 Molen (Golem)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Zertinan Cavern - Hourglass Basin
[Spawn] Go to the very northern edge in the east (accessible from the blue
        save crystal area secret path), where you see lots of Grenades. Stand
        there for 10 seconds and you can watch this one spawn.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 342 Larva Eater (Gargoyle)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] The Great Crystal
[Spawn] Spawning this monster can be a test of you or your family's patience.
        It spawns at many possible places: (1) Waystone VIII-IX, (2) Waystone
        X, XII ~ XVI, and XX. The later spawn is a higher-level version of it,
        but all other stats remain the same.

        To spawn it you have to defeat more than 256 enemies in the Great
        Crystal. Following the first spawn, you need to defeat 30-255 enemies
        for each subsequent spawn.

[Drops] Low (3/6/8/12%): Danjuro

Note: This is the only way to get the best dagger, Danjuro. However, it is a
      very weak weapon by then, and you will probably never use it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 343 Tower (Babil)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Pharos - Third Ascent 88F (near the zone exit)
[Spawn] 20% chance to spawn, when use the waystone to return to a small area
        on 79F, and return.
[Drops] Super Low (1/2/3/5%): Grand Helm

Note: This is the only way to get the best Heavy Helm, Grand Helm - another
      extremely tedious mechanics that is designed to waste your time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] [Trophy] 344 Arioch (Gargoyle)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Nebreus Deadlands - The Slumbermead
[Spawn] Spawns with a 40% chance when entering this area, which is directly
        south of the orange save crystal.
[Steal] Low (3/6%): Sage's Ring

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 345 Grey Moler (Viper)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Mosphoran Highwaste - Empyrean Way

[Where] Golmore Jungle - Paths of Chained Light
[Spawn] Four possible spawn spots around the northern loop, with a 20% chance
        to appear when you enter the area. However, it won't show up until
        you get close.

Note: If you don't see it after walking around, kill all enemies, go to the
      neighboring zone (one zone is enough), re-enter a few more times, and
      check around again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] [Trophy] 348 Crystal Knight (Crusader)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] The Great Crystal - XX Teleporter
[Spawn] Starting from the area with Waystone XX, make a "clock-wise" circle
        between four rooms, and this monster spawns in the XX waystone room.

           o -> S*
          /    /
        XX <- o

        XX: Room with XX Waystone
        S*: Room with the Sagittarius Switch (don't need to touch it)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] [Trophy] 349 Nazarnir (Sleipnir)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Giza Plains - Starfell Field (Dry)
[Spawn] Just SW of the blue save crystal. 40% to replace the Sleipnir here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 350 Grave Lord (Skeleton)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Golmore Jungle - The Rustling Chapel
[Spawn] Spawns in the middle of the three square platforms, when the chain
        number reaches 21 or more. It is easier to chain the (quite powerful)
        undeads that pop up right after you defeat all regular enemies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] [Trophy] 351 Victanir (Shadonir)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Nam-Yensa Sandsea - Yellow Sands
[Spawn] Three possible spawn spots close to the exit of Zertinan Cavern. 
        Appears 40% of the time when you enter the area. It has the "vanish"
        status, but will appear and attack you when you get close.
[Steal] Low (3/6%) Wargod's Band

Note: Wargod's Band is an ingredient for Tournesol. An alternative way is to
      kill the Leynir (horse) enemy (203) just north of the Orange Crystal
      in Nebreus Deadlands. It is probably faster that way if you have the
      correct monograph.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] [Trophy] 352 Zombie Lord (Forbidden)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] The Tomb of Raithwall - Northfall Passage
[Spawn] Spawns in 5 possible locations all over the place, but only when the
        Minute number on the clock is between 0 and 29.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 353 Gemhorn (Slaven)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Lhusu Mines - Site 11
[Spawn] Spawns at the SW corner, when all monsters in this area are defeated.
        Don't miss the 2 mimic chest enemies, one at the SW corner and the
        other close to the gate swith in the north.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 354 Drowned (Ghoul)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Garamscythe Waterway - No. 4 Cloaca Spur
[Spawn] This monster spawns at the bottom, so you have to close the No.4 water
        gate first. When you stay in this area after 5 minutes, it has a 8%
        (accumulative) chance to spawn every 15 seconds. So basically just
        wait there.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 355 Luxollid (Light Elemental, Entite)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Pharos-Subterra - Umbra-South (B2F)
[Spawn] Complete the Seer hunt. Proceed to defeat Rare Monster Vagrant Soul
        (357), and directly come to the large east room of the SW area.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 356 Velelu (Banshee)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Nebreus Deadlands - The Fog Mutters
[Spawn] Two possible spawn spots, east and west. Spawns when a party member's
        HP is less than 20% MAX, not necessarily beside the party. Once it
        spawns, it won't go away even if the party member is healed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 357 Vagrant Soul (Dark Elemental, Entite)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Pharos-Subterra - Abyssal-North (B3F)

        east room of the NW section.

        Lords with a 5% chance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 359 Imdugud (Zu)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Nam-Yansa Sandsea - Withering Shores
[Spawn] The Ultimania guide says this monster spawns when you stand on the
        very western edge of the circular platform at the end for 10 seconds.

        Personally I've fought this monster twice, and I had to wait for much
        longer than 10 seconds both times. The Bagoly monsters would respawn
        for quite a few more times before stopped showing up. Then I zoned a
        few times (just one zone) and came back to wait another 10 seconds to
        finally make it show up.

        Wendigos in 5 minutes.

        Oversouls (207) in any area of Necrohol to make it spawn.
[Drops] Super Low (1/2/3/5%): Grand Armor

Note: This is the only way to obtain the best Heavy Armor, Grand Armor. The
      Maximillian is usually the preferred Heavy Armor, as it can be purchased
      from the secret merchant of the Nechrohol, and offers good bonus in SPD.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] [Trophy] 368 Avenger (Bune)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Pharos-Second Ascent - Station of Ascension
[Spawn] 63F, NW section. 40% chance to spawn when entering the area.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 369 Pallicant (Mallicant)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Ridorana Cataract - City of Other Days
[Spawn] Defeat all enemies in this area, leave and re-enter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] [Trophy] 370 Alteci (Behemoth)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Zertinan Cavern - The Undershore
[Spawn] Chain more than 11 of anything (Mallicant works fine).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 371 Phyllo (Vampyr)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Golmore Jungle - The Branchway
[Spawn] The spawn chance is 20%, when the party enters the area. There are two
        spawn spots, the SW dead end, and the little SW dead end of the
        southern loop. It won't pop out unless the party gets close. The best
        way is to kill all enemies in the area, check both spots, and if it is
        not there, zone (one is enough) a few times and check again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rare] 372 Urutan Exile (Urutan-Yensa)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Ogir-Yensa Sandsea - Platform 2-Refinery
[Spawn] Chain more than 100 Urutan-Yensa in the Ogir-Yensa Sandsea, and then
        enter this area from at least 2 zones away. This rare monster spawns
        in the middle of the square platform.

Note: If you want to find this monster after the plot progresses past the
      Sandsea, expect to chain much more than 100. I have heard the
      requirement going up to chain 400-500.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
373-A Seeq Cateran (Seeq)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] The Mosphoran Highwaste - Empyrean Way
[Spawn] Replaces two of the wolves here with a 30% chance, two each time.

Note: This is the easiest way to complete the Seeq bestiary entry. There are
      other places to fight them, just for your information.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
375 Garif Adventurer (Garif)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Ozmone Plain - The Greensnake (The long winding road with lots of Wus)
[Spawn] Appears 20% of the time. One at a time. There are a total of six
        possible spawn spots from north to south.

Note: This is the ONLY way to complete the Garif bestiary entry, and you need
      10! This one can be a huge pain. I suggest you save at the blue crystal
      NE of the Greensnake, which is two zones away. When you enter the area
      from the north, if you don't see it, kill the rabbits and everything
      in sight, and continue south. If nothing spawns, reload and come again!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
377-B Bangaa Pirate (Bangaa)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Where] Phon Coast - Mauleia Coast
[Spawn] Replaces Mandragora enemies in the middle-west with a 30% chance. Two
        each time.

Note: This is the easiest way to complete the Bangaa bestiary entry. There are
      other places to fight them, just for your information.

[8d. Detection]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You have probably wondered why "Vanish" does not really make you invisible
as monsters still chase you across the zone. Hopefully you will get a better
idea through this section.

All monsters in FF12 detect enemies (you) out of four senses:

(1) Vision (V)
    Usually applies to monsters that have, obviously, eyes. This is the only
    sense that can be deceived by the Vanish status. The area of detection
    is usually a partial circle (fan) centered on the direction that the
    monster is currently facing, because... eyes are located at the center
    of the face.

(2) Sound (S)
    Sound detection is usually not as far-reaching as vision. There has been
    a rumor that the Float status makes no footstep sound, therefore ignores
    monsters' hearing. The Ultimania guide does not mention this anywhere, so
    it may be just a beautiful piece of imagination.

(3) Life (L)
    Life detection is actually the "loss of life" detection. When your HP is
    less than 40%, certain types of monsters (undead, plants and bugs) can
    detect your weakness through the Force. Oh I mean the Mist.

(4) Magic (M)
    Only applies to monsters that "go nuts" when you cast magic, because of
    the Mist distortion. You can always explain nonsense with the the Mist.

Below I will give a list of all types of monsters' detection type, radius (r),
and angle (deg, if not 360 degrees, centered in the middle of their face). See
Section 10f to have a better idea of what distances represent.

 =======================================================
| Category         | (V) r  deg | (S) r | (L) r | (M) r |

|------------------|------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Elemental        |    --      |    -- |    -- |    20 |
 =======================================================

Therefore, Vanish is effective against Bird, Giant, Insects (if HP > 40%),
Materials, Imperial Army and Humanoids, because of their poor sound detection
radius.

o Chain detection?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The same type of monsters can chain their detections, just like we yell out
danger to warn families and friends. When a monster enters battle and is
within the detection area of a second same-type monster, the second monster
also enters battle mode.

9. Espers

______________________________________________________________________________
==============================================================================

Espers are widely regarded as weak and vulnerable, compared to your threesome
party. Let's take a look at what they actually do in this section.

Here are a few facts to keep in mind:
1. An Esper's level is identical to its summoner, so their stats grow. Yet
   Espers have fixed ATK, DEF, and MDEF (like wearing the same "equipment")
2. Each summon lasts 1 minute and 30 seconds. The summon session also ends
   when either the summoner or the Esper dies, or the Esper uses its ultimate
   move (marked with * below).
3. An Esper follows its own gambits, just like party guests.
4. An Esper can still cast magics even if there is not enough MP. This means
   that you can Syphon their MP freely.
5. Espers are immune to almost all negative status.
6. All of these ultimate attacks are area-effect attacks, with a range of 8,
   and targeting the enemy with the highest MAX HP.
7. Esper's damages are also subject to target's damage reduction ability.

Here is a list of abbreviations I will be using below:

              # = Number of Mist Charge required to summon
            POW = Power (see section 2a and 3a for damage formula)
Fir/Ice/Thd/Wat = Fire, Ice, Thunder, Water
Ear/Wnd/Hol/Dak = Earth, Wind, Holy, Dark
Abs/Haf/Wek/Imm = Absorb, Half, Weak, Immune

10. Miscellaneous FAQs

______________________________________________________________________________
==============================================================================

Although I used to call this section Trivia, some of them are truely "FAQs".

______________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[10a. Giza Plain Rain & Dry]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Giza plain starts raining after the Tomb of Raithwall plot. The rain will not
stop until later in the game. Some people have experienced dry seasons as
early as finishing the Henne's mine plot.

Once you pass this point, the Rain & Dry weather of Giza Plain rotates in the
following fashion:

Dry:  2 hours
Rain: 1 hour

The time above is in-game play time. Another way to check whether you are
eligible for the dry season is to talk to the Seeq beside the orange crystal.
When he reveals himself as the "weather eye", the rotation has started.

[10b. Clan Shop goods]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is a complete list of what the Clan shop offers at different ranks. For
simplicity I list the ranks based on the minimal number of hunts completed,
since it is usually the bottleneck.

Items:                     Magics:                Accessories:

 T = Teleport Stone 200 G   V = Bravery  5,800 G   B = Bubble Belt   19,800 G
 G = Geshyl Green   108 G   F = Faith    5,800 G   N = Nihopalona    30,000 G
 K = Knot of Rust     6 G   B = Bubble   3,300 G   C = Cat Ear Hood  30,000 G
 W = Warp Mote      100 G   R = Reverse  7,600 G
 P = Potion          70 G
 H = Hi-Potion      210 G

[10c. Caution: Repeatable Bazaar Items]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quite a few bazaar items can be obtained more than once. However, there is
one important thing. Every time an item becomes an available, the hidden
counter of all of its ingredients previously sold are reset to 0.

For example, even if you sell 99 High Arcana, 99 Snake skin and 99 Serpent
Eyes, you only get 1 Serpentarius Gem. However, if you sell 24 times of
High Arcana x 1, Snake Skin x 4 and Serpent Eye x2, you get 24 Serpentarius
Gems.

Therefore, you should NOT sell all of your ingredients that is enough to
convert to multiple desired bazaar items. Rather, sell them in batches so
the overflow is not wasted.

A little tip of this rule is to "share" ingredients before they get reset
to 0, during a successful conversion to a repeatable bazaar item. For example,
if you sell:

High Arcana x 1, Snake Skin x 4, Serpent Eye x 2, Soul Powder x 1 and
Wargod's Band x 2 all together, you get one Serpentarius Gem, and one Empyreal
Soul. You only spent 1 High Arcana, instead of 2, because High Arcana is
required for both formula.

[10d. Sandstorm after Tyrant]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is really hard to get another sandstorm in Westersand, after defeating the
optional boss Earth Tyrant. Although I forgot where I read that the sandstorm
only has a 1% chance to come back, people have been reporting that they can
get the sandstorm easier while entering the Westersand from a raining Giza
Plain.  (According to John Chiofolo, the chance is as high as ~40%!)

However, it is theoretically possible to get a sandstorm when you enter the
greater Westersand area from outside, such as Estersand and Zertinan Caverns.

[10e.     ing Minigame]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am going to talk about the fishing minigame, which represents FF12 pretty
well. I made the title as such to reflect the reality - there is no fish in
fishing.

Anyways, there seems to be a misconception that you must have five perfect
trips "in a row" to advance in down- and mid-stream, but actually all you
need is to accumulate 6 perfect fishing trips. Five perfect trips "in a row"
also works, at least from Down to Midstream (Thanks to Drew Gibson).

The Brady guide also omitted a critical piece of information. You can start
collecting the colored bottles only after completing the Gilgamesh hunt mark.

[10f. Distance]

10g. Guests & New Party Members
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Throughout the game various characters will join the party. Usually they are
a few levels higher than the party, with a certain LP that's roughly equal
to what you have accumulated so far. But how much exactly? Here is a list:

G = Guest
P = Joins permanently
Highest Level = HI-Lv

Note: LP points are accumulative. Spent or not, it does not matter.

 ===================================================================

 ===================================================================

Note: The Ultimania guide states Balthier's starting LP to be
      "(Vaan's LP + Fran's LP)/2 - 135", but 
      "Vaan's LP - 135" seems to be the case.

By the way, since Larsa and Reddas are with the party for quite some time,
let's take a look at their gambit:

 ===========================================================================
|           Larsa's Gambit             |           Reddas's Gambit          |

|2| Ally: HP < 50%       | Hi-Potion   | Foe: targeting self  | Attack      |
|3| Foe: flying          | Telekinesis | Foe: highest level   | Attack      |
|4| Foe: leader's target | Attack      | Foe: nearest visible | Attack      |

10h. Breaking Damage Limit
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Normally, damaging / healing amount is capped at 9999, but here is a complete
list of actions that are not restricted by the 9999 cap:

 =========================================================================
| Cat.  | Action       | Note                                             |
|-------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Magic | Raise        | When you fully revive or heal a 9999+ HP         |
|       | Arise        | character, possible with bubble belt.            |
|       | Renew        |                                                  |
|-------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Magic | Balance      | When a 9999+ HP character goes HP critical.      |
| Item  | Balance Mote |                                                  |
|-------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Tech  | Numerology   | See Section 4c.                                  |
|-------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Tech  | Sight        | For target's HP > 10008, more than 9999 HP is    |
|       |  Unseeing    | reduced.                                         |
|-------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Tech  | Bonecrusher  | See Section 4c. You kill the target if the hit   |
|       |              | connects, but you may sustain more than 9999 DMG |
|       |              | yourself, if the character has 9999+ HP XD       |
|-------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Item  | Dark Matter  | See Section 3e.                                  |
| Esper | Soul Purge   | Shamhazai's ultimate move.                       |
|-------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Esper | Gravity Well | Zeromus. See Section 9. Pretty much like Balance |
|       | Big Bang     | x 2 and Balance x 5. Bubble status helps.        |
|-------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Esper | Comet        | Exodus. See Section 9. Bubble status helps.      |
|       | Meteor       |                                                  |
|-------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Esper | Final        | Zodiark. See Section 9. DMG is fixed at 50000.   |
|       |  Eclipse     |                                                  |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Quickening Hits &    | See Section 7.                                   |
| Concurrences         |                                                  |
 =========================================================================

However, there is one monster ability "Damage Cut" (see Section 8a). This
ability multiplies all damages received by the monster by 0.7. So the maximum
regular attack damage is locked at 6999, instead of 9999.

So which monsters are cheating? Accodring to Ultimania: Entites, Omega MKXII,
Yiazmat (when HP < 50%), Hell Wyrm (when HP < 50%), crystal bugs and more.

Ultimania also mentions that damages usually breaking the damage limit will
also be reduced to 6999. However, I have witnessed numerous cases that these
damages are not capped at 9999. For example:

- There is a YouTube clip showing that Final Eclipse deals exactly 35000
  damage, and kills Yiazmat in that specific blow. 

- I threw a Dark Matter to finish off Omega MKXII, dealing 42000 damage.
  Here is the YouTube link:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-3DmUTwIWo

- Entites do suffer damages greater than 6999 (9999 possible).

Also, although Espers are not listed for having the Damage Cut ability,
when I threw fully-charged Dark Matters at dying Zodiark and Ultima, I
also dealt 42000 damage.

Therefore, if I did not mis-interpret the Ultimania guide, the "Damage Cut"
ability might have been modified in the NA release. For now, Dark Matter
seems to be a very handy final blow against powerful enemies, which cut
regular attack damages significantly (x 1/3) at critical HP.

10i. Sky Pirate's Den
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Completing the Sky Pirate's Den (30 figures in total) nets you the Order of
Ambrosia, if you have done all 45 hunts, and have > 1M clan points. This is
the highest clan rank to be achieved.

However, achieving this rank brings no practical benefit. Order of Ambrosia is
also nicknamed "the Proof of Junkie", as the bearer wastes countless hours on
extremely repetitive, frustrating and mind-numbing video gameplay for it.

Let's take a look at the requirement for the most-frequently asked figures, if
you are still interested:

 ==========================================================================
| Name     | Condition                                                     |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| BaGamnon | Collect all entries in Bestiary. You do NOT have to complete  |
|          | any entry (Need -> 0). The entry alone is enough.             |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dalan    | Visit all zones in the world (excluding Bahamut, Leviathan,   |
           | Draklor and perhaps a few other individual zones)             |
|          | Maps & removing shadow are NOT necessary. Rooms without mini- |
|          | map do not matter.                                            |
 ==========================================================================

Note: Special thanks to Tentakel's clip for a solid evidence on BaGamnon:

10j. Hunt Club Rewards
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you handy in various trophies to one of the three Bangaas, Atak, Block
and Stok, rewards will become available for purchase fro the Shifty-Eyed Man,
who is standing just on the right of the trio.

When you give all trophies to ONE of the them:

 ===========================================================================
|  # | Atak (Weapon)   Gil | Block (Armor)       Gil | Stok (Item)      Gil |
|----|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
|  1 | Kogarasumaru   5040 | Demon Mail         4410 | Thief's Cuffs   2700 |
|----|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
|  5 | Obelisk        6750 | Diamond Armor      6300 | Steel Poleyns    900 |
|----|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| 10 | Murasame       7650 | Mirror Mail        7290 | Winged Boots     450 |
|----|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| 15 | Diamond Sword 11250 | Gaia Gear          8370 | Indigo Pendant  4500 |
|----|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| 20 | Deathbringer  14400 | Dragon Mail       11250 | Diamond Armlet 18000 |
|----|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| 25 | Gastrophetes  18900 | Magepower Shishak 13500 | Reflectga Mote   270 |
|----|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| 30 | Gungnir       25500 | Maximillian       25500 | Holy Mote        150 |
|----|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
|Most| Greataxe       Free | Renewing Morion    Free | Sage's Ring     Free |
 ===========================================================================

At the end, you also receive a free reward depending on which Seeq has the
most trophies from you.

According to Sephirosuy's FAQ, you can unlock more items by giving trophies
to different Seeqs.

Unfortunately, there is no top-tier reward. In my game, I gave all my trophies
to Stok, hoping to buy lots of Holy Motes for end game. However, there is only
ONE available for purchase (same for all other rewards). I got ONE Holy Mote
for turning in all of the 30 trophies. Very funny.

10k. Brady Guide Corrections
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While the Brady Guide is quite well-made, there are a few mistakes that often
cause frustration:

(p 59) Quickening - Luminesence & Whiteout are switched.

(p 79) Chest No. 11 - Main Gauche should be Mage Masher. I have received quite
       a few player feedbacks about this chest (thank you all). All but one
       of them had no luck with Main Gauche at all after many attempts.
       Therefore, I am now inclined to assume the guide is actually completely
       wrong here. If you do get a Main Gauche, please email me like Jason
       Tobias did. Thanks!

(p119) Chest No. 18 - Main Gauche should be Mage Masher. The same possible
       mistake is repeated in this chest of Ogir-Yensa Sandsea.

(p159) A completely useless tutorial map wasted this page.

(p226) No. 17 Hunt Mark - Wrong Map for Mosphoran Highwaste.

(p227) Deathscythe Hunt. Only one (not two) character is needed to be in
       HP < 10% (not critical, which is 20%) condition.

(p231) Bottom of left column: Bottom paragraph should read "Complete the
       Dalmasca's Desert Bloom hunt (page 224)..."

       Right column: End of third paragraph should read "(See the Cactaur
       Family on page 239.)" 

       Middle of fifth paragraph should read "Next on the list is a Great
       Serpentskin, which is a reward from the "Marauder in the Mines' hunt
       (see page 224)."

       End of bottom paragraph should read "The passage leads to the Esper
       Zalera (see page 53)." 

(p241) Windvane picture - wrong location. The correct Giant Cactus is located
       in the small area NW of the Zertinan cavern zone, not the Shimmering
       Horizon as shown in the picture.

(p242) Medallion side quest: swapped labels for Filo and Curious Woman.

(p244) Hunt Club - Omitted Biding Mantis (323).
       No. 5 Gavial - Wrong map. This map is for Melt(304).

(p249) Fishing Minigame - Omitted that colored bottle only appears after
       completing the Gilgamesh hunt.

(p254) Archades Information Exchange: a lot of story matches are reversed.

(p255) (p294) Omega MKXII HP is 1 million in the NA release, not 10 million.

       I recorded my Omega battle, and sumed up all damages. The total 
       damage required to defeat Omega MKXII was about 1.01 Million.

       (By the way, Omega attacked 78 times, inducing 3 berserks.)

(p266) Masamune price is wrong. (Reward (free), or Bazzar 350000 Gil)

(p268) Whale Whisker - Requires 4 X Aquarius Gem, not 1.

(p270) Long Bow and Killer Bow ATK switched.

(p281) Stats of Genji Helm (MDEF) and Genji Armor (DEF) misplaced to EVA.

(p292) Bazaar recipe for "Golden Garb" is wrong. Should be:
       Iron Carapace x3, Tanned Hide x2, Dark Magicite x5

(p328) Bestiary #203 misses name: Leynir

[Map / Area Omissions]

 Barheim Passage Hidden Area
 Great Crystal Upper Area
 Lhusu Mines Hidden Area
 Pharos Subterra
 Zertinan Cavern

Note: There are nice map FAQs here on this site that cover the above areas.

After Pharos you can go to the following places to complete your magic spell
collection:

Renew   - Westersand Merchant
Ardor   - Barheim Passage, the Bangaa merchant at the very north end
Scathe  - Necrohol of Nabudis, Secret Merchant

That concludes the Game Mechanics FAQ. I will keep updating this FAQ and
hopefully it will include every piece of trivia that you actually want to know
about FF12.

As a final note, I sincerly hope future FFs focus much less on repetitive,
well-hidden, time-wasting yet you-fail-without-knowing-it details, so a boring
mechanics FAQ like this one would actually become a necessity. Dull story and
weak music may be forgiven because writers/composers might have given their
best, but torturing designs like this are clearly intentional.

In the following Appendix sections, I will include information that I think is
worth reading, but not really related to Game Mechanics. Hopefully you find
them useful.

Appendix A: the Controller Issue

______________________________________________________________________________
==============================================================================

In the evening of October 31, 2006, the release date of FF12 in North America,
there were about one to two dozens of users, myself included, came to the
forum of GameFAQ / GameSpot in panic.

We all reported the same problem:

1. "Triangle" does not call up the Menu, but functions during dialogues (log).

2. "Select" does not call up the Minimap.

3. During a paused game, "Square" does not quit to title, and "Cross" does
   not skip the scene.

Since then, we hear one or two new cases every day, with the identical
problem. As of January, 2007, we have accumulated about one hundred reports.
Also, thanks to everybody who shared their experiences, we now have more than
limited knowledge of this controller issue:

In my personal communication with a Square-Enix support personnel, on Nov. 1,
2006, I was told that the company was assessing whether to make a public
announcement about this problem. Apparently, no such announcement has been
made.

Here is a standard response letter from Square-Enix:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RE: Final Fantasy XII controller problem (#8463-58066156-5153)

Square Enix Customer Support
6:25 pm (November 3, 2006)

Thank you for contacting Square Enix Customer Support,

It has come to our attention that some customers have been experiencing
control issues with FINAL FANTASY XII, particularly the use of the triangle or
select buttons. The developers of FINAL FANTASY XII made the decision to
fundamentally change the way a FINAL FANTASY title is played. One of these
changes is the inclusion of restrictions on the controls at certain times
within gameplay, until certain qualifications have been met.

However, if you do feel that this is not the case for your situation, we
would suggest using an official Sony PlayStation2 DUALSHOCK 2 controller. Some
customers have reported that using a different DUALSHOCK 2 controller from the
one normally used on a daily basis has resolved their control issues. It is
possible that this issue may be due to worn hardware, or communication issues
between the console and the controller, please ensure all cables are inserted
correctly, be aware that disconnected a controller during game play can cause
issues with communication between the devices as well.

We hope this information has been of assistance.

Thanks,

Square Enix Customer Support

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the very beginning of Rek's tutorial, the player has no access to menu.
However, it has nothing to do with the permanent controller problem described
above.

So far, there is only one solution to this problem:

 -------------------------
| Get another controller. |
 -------------------------

Important Notice (Updated: 12/28/2006)
******************************************************************************

Special thanks to Kerri Jo Meyer. Here is a quote from her email:

        ... this afternoon (my husband) called someone at Square-Enix.
        He was told that any dual shock 2 controller that has a capital
        letter "A" branded on the back of the controller may have
        this problem. Back of controller says:

        Sony (R)
        Analog Controller
        Sony Computer
        Entertainment Inc. A <------------
        
        Switching to any other controller that does not have the "A"
        should solve the problem.  

******************************************************************************

I have checked my both "defective" controllers and they both have the "A".
I then initiated a thread on the gamefaq/gamespot forum, asking for any
conflicting evidence.

So far, every single problematic controller has this "A" on the back. However,
many working controllers also have the unlucky "A". In one case, a working
controler with an "A" suddenly gets this problem (Thanks to Adam Smith).

Therefore, the "A" controller has a potential to get this problem.

If your controller has the same problem, please help us to verify this by
checking the back of your controller.

If you don't see the "A", please write to me to prove that the above statement
is not true, otherwise we will conclude that we finally have a solid solution 
-- get a controller without that "A" !


So, what's the cause of the problem? We do not know for sure.

- "Static shock" (by the controller) has been reported to happen just before
  this problem occurs.

- In several reported cases, working controllers suddenly go bad,
  and never came back to normal.

- In another reported case, a controller with this problem suddenly went
  back to normal, after the user smashed multiple buttons.

If you know more about the cause of the controller problem, please write to
me and enlighten the rest of us!

 ===========================================================================

Note1: Cyclone is listed as neither Physical nor Magical. It seems that DEF is
       unrelated to the damage received. The damage of Cyclone increases when
       Yiazmat is at critical HP, up to 9999.

Note2: Stone Breath and White Breath has a fan radius of 6, and width of 120
       degrees.

So what's the fastest way to defeat Yiazmat?

The information below is straight from Ultimania Omega, about how to defeat
Yiazmat in 50 minutes. Special thanks go to Sionkuja@ffsky.cn for making it
available to us.

You don't have to exactly copy this strategy. For example, leveling all
characters to Lv 99 is very time-consuming, much more than the time you save
on Yiazmat.

[Basic concept]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Two damage dealers.
 - Pick: Basch & Balthier, for their decent STR and lack of MAG and MP.
 - Always HP critical (DMG x 2)
 - Always Berserk (DMG x 1.5, Charge x 2)
 - High-combo weapon + Bravery suit

2. One leader.
 - All 4 other members all designated for this job.
 - Focus on self reverse + decoy
 - Control the situation

3. Switch in and out party members manually
 - When leader dies, switch in another leader to restore control.

[Preparations]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. All characters lv 99, all licenses purchased.

2. Leader(s):

[Status] Reverse, Lure, Regen, Bubble, Protect, Libra, Haste

[Weapon] Staff of the Magi
[Helmet] Crown of Laurel (Vaan & Fran) / Duel Mask (Ashe & Penelo)
[Armor ] Lordly Robe
[Acces.] Power Armlet (immune to Stop)

[Gambit]

 1. Foe: HP < 100000       Dark Matter
 2. Ally: any              Chronos Tear
 3. Ally status: Reflect   Dispel
 4. Self                   Reverse
 5. Ally: any              Arise
 6. Self                   Decoy
 7. Self                   Bubble
 8. Self: MP < 50%         High Ether
 9. Ally: MP < 10%         Berserk
10: Ally: MP < 10%         Haste
11: Ally: any              Gold Needle
12: Foe: any               Dispel

3. Damage Dealers:

[Status] HP Critical, Berserk, Float, Haste (Basch)

[Weapon] Masaume (Interestingly, not Yagyu Darkblade)
[Helmet] Celebrant's Mitter (MAG & SPD)
[Armor ] Brave Suit (DMG x 1.3)
[Acces.] Genji Gloves (Basch) / Hermes Boots (Balthier)

[Gambit]

 1. Ally: any              Chronos Tear
 2. Self: HP < 10%         Berserk
 3. Foe: HP < 10%          Attack
 4. Self: HP < 10%         Bacchu's Wine
 5. Self:                  Infuse (MP -> HP)

4. Inventory:

Dark Matter      x  1 (charged to full with Knof of Rust, 60k DMG)
Yagyu Darkblade  x  1 or more
Shell Shield     x  1 or more
Bubble Belt      x  4 or more
High Ether       Plenty
Remedy           Plenty
Gold Needle      Plenty
Chronos Tear     Plenty
Bacchu's Wine    Plenty

5. Config:

[Battle]: Active Mode
[Speed ]: Fastest
[Cursor]: Memorized

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Leader's Action from Minute 01
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. To start the battle, get five successful Expose on Yiazmat. This cuts its
   DEF by half.

2. Leader runs around Yiazmat, always trying to chase its tail from its side.
   Better don't get too close, so you can  always run away from Instant KO.

3. After Yiazmat HP < 20% (Growing Threat), start to use Bubble Belt on the
   leader. Also, whenenver the leader becomes immobilized or KOed, also use
   Bubble Belt to make sure he/she is revived with 2X HP.

4. Watch Yiazmat. When the "shake head" animation (I guess it means Cyclone)
   is over, quickly press Triangle to switch in and out members.

5. Leader is usually under the "R2" (fleeing) mode, if there is nothing to do.

6. When Yiazmat readies Cyclone, the leader must be far away from others.

7. When Yiazmat readies Death Strike, the leader puts on a Shell Shield.
   Switch back to Staff of Magi afterwards.

8. When leader gets KO, quickly open the menu, switch out Balthier for a
   second leader. Priority is Arise -> Reverse -> Lure -> Bubble. Only
   after all buffs are ready, switch back in Balthier.

9. During the last HP bar of Yiazmat, switch a fresh leader in.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If your leader steps on a trap:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. If damaged, make sure you have the "Reverse" status, and thank Yiazmat for
   healing.

2. If getting bad status like silence, toss a remedy manually.

3. If losing control because of berserk, manually switch on Yagyu Darkblade,
   and go to 4.

4. If losing control, switch out Balthier to get a new leader in to toss a
   remedy or dispel. Make sure Arise -> Reverse -> Lure -> Bubble do exist on
   both "leaders", then switch Balthier back.

Have fun!

User Feedbacks
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

According to Mookiethebold, while following the exact gambit setup, the damage
dealers Infuse themsleves to death (as there was no MP recovery in time). It
seems that the AI does not hault infusing even if their MP is 0. We are still
waiting for more feedbacks on this issue.

Appendix C: The Making of Game Mechanics FAQ

______________________________________________________________________________
==============================================================================

A lot of readers asked me why I made this Mechanics FAQ while I despise FF12's
sleep-inducing story, tune-lacking music, tedious gameplay, etc. Now, I would
like to share my story with you -- the story about this FAQ.

It all started in the North America release evening, October 31, 2006. Within
a few minutes of game clock (if I could see it), I realized that I couldn't
call up the menu with Triangle, view the minimap with Select, etc. I tried
both of my official PS2 controllers, purchased at different locations at
different times, with no luck.

I knew where I should go -- I came to the GameFAQ / GameSpot forum and looked
for help, only to find out that a dozen of people were also crying the exact
same problem. We couldn't play our game!

     Just for the record: the board was such a crowded place that night.
     A topic would be pushed to page 6 within a minute.

We, the players who had this problem, made a joint effort of identifying the
source. We started writing to Square-Enix, trying another PS2 or controller,
reporting our model numbers and places of purchase, etc. In a few days, we came
into consensus that it was probably a controller issue, as the problem could
be readily solved by using another controller. My case was a rarity that both
of my controllers were "broken" although they work perfectly in all other
games I played.

I also checked out some Asian forums, and it seemed that the problem only
exists in the NA version.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I contacted S-E in two ways. On the 2nd evening, November 1st, 2006, from a
S-E online support staff, I learned that S-E was already aware of the problem,
and they were assessing "whether to announce it" -- that certain official Sony
Duel-Shock 2 controllers may be incompatible with the game.

Later, my email was also replied. It was a very poorly-informed response. You
can see the exact content from Appendix A above.

Knowing that the company has probably decided to down-play this serious, but
not very wide-spreading problem, I went to Wikipedia FF12 entry, and added a
little section of "Controller Issue". I reported this problem as accurately
as I could.

Within a few hours, my information was formatted and proofread by other fellow
Wiki users. It was also edited to become a "bug" in its section title.

However, suddenly, the entire section was "deleted" by a fellow user of
Wikipedia. I was shocked, and I put the section back in thinking maybe this
was an editing accident. It was promptly removed again by the same user.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This user's reason to remove my words was that this is an "Original Research".
An Original Research here means that I was the first person to reveal this
controller issue, so I had no reference. Wikipedia does not accept information
with no trust-worthy references, just in case people would flood the online
encyclopedia with unsupported, bogus claims. This is understandable and I
respect this policy.

Realizing I need references, I gave this Wikipedia fellow user various links
of the threads on the GameFAQ / GameSpot forum, where about a dozen of users
(numbers constantly climbing) were still posting about this problem within the
last 48 hours.

This user denied my reference, because "I was the creator of this thread".
Actually, I happen to be the creator of the "Summary of Controller Issue"
thread. Obviously, one cannot reference himself in this situation, despite that
many users replied in the same thread that they have the same problem.

Oh well.

     Just for the record, when I was editing Wiki, I took a look at some
     change logs. In the past 24 hours, the FF12 Wiki page received about 100
     editions of how well the game was received.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Knowing that I was up against some serious FF12-Wiki babysitter, and I did not
have all day to continue this police-and-thief(that's me!) game, I thought I
need to work on some... serious reference.

Within a few days, I submitted a controller issue FAQ to GameFAQs. It was
promptly rejected because of "Lack_of_Content" (exact quote), despite that a
couple of other FAQs at that time had smaller file size.

Knowing that I need some serious content, I looked at the list of FAQs then,
and decided to borrow useful information I read from the internet, translate
them into English, to become a "Game Mechanism FAQ". A lot of posts at that
time were about weapon comparison, stats of characters, weapon damage etc, so
I thought game mechanism should be a good starting point. I happen to like
math, so I was quite happy compiling the information as well.

The first submission of the mechanism FAQ was denied due to "incompleteness".
I then spent some more time to make it look more "complete" -- adding some
more paragraphs, and deleting some "coming soon" place holders in the Table of
Content. It was accepted eventually, and renamed "Game Mechanics FAQ". It was
only about 1/5 of the size of what you see today. 

And, at the end of the Mechanics FAQ came the Appendix of Controller Issue.
I did not include it before acceptance, fearing a similar fate it suffered
earlier.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the meantime, we still hear about 1 to 2 new cases of the identical
controller problem every day.

When troubled users (including myself) came to the forum, they were usually
met with hostility. This hostility largely troubled me at that time, as we,
the victims, were not only ignored by a irresponsible game company, but also
insulted by ignorant fellow players who lacks the ability to imagine someone
else's situation. This frustration soon became another reason why I would like
to struggle for a formal, credible, published source of controller issue, so
we can permanently silence the uninformed & ill-mannered.

As more and more people are reporting the same problem to the forum, I am
happy that they can all be referred to this guide to know they are not alone.
A breakthrough of information came in just before New Year, and I was very
excited about it. (See Appendix A)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the meantime, another user gave me a source of the actual Battle Ultimania
guide (which is specialized in the game mechanics), so I no longer had to
collect may-be-imaginary information from the web.

This Battle Ultimania guide has a truck load of information, and is truly
helpful especially for such a detail-oriented, but tells-you-nothing-about-it
game. If you can read Japanese or Chinese, and you would like to learn more,
write me an email.

With the Ultimania guide I updated a lot of sections in the FAQ. However,
thanks to various readers' feedbacks, this FAQ also have a lot of information
that Ultimania does not have.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One day, in another FF forum, I read that somebody briefly quoted a FF12
developer interview. I learned that the developers made all of these torturing
rare monster spawns, drops, and chests so people will be puzzled after a few
hours of failure, and come out to ask for help and exchange information -- 
thus they talk about this game more. 

They call this "encouraging players' interaction". 

In my view, though, it has no good meaning at all. This is nothing but a
technique to boost the game's popularity, by flushing players time down the
drain! From another interview translation, a developer revealed that they made
us miss the zodiac spear so easily, so we would have the motivation to play
the game again.

I was deeply annoyed by their technique. This is not what a company should
treat their customers. The customers have a right to rebel. I choose to take
a small step further.

In this 300Kb of text, I have revealed everything there is to waste your
time in this extremely torturing and mind-numbing game, so you do not have to
come out and "exchange information", wondering in eternity with no clear
answer. My information comes from their official guide, so it is 100% accurate
unless I make a mistake in translation.

No matter you like FF12 or not, I would be glad that this FAQ helped you save
time. And please help other puzzled users by referring them to this guide,
if what they seek can be found inside.

I have received a lot of heart-warming emails, and I thank you sincerely for
them.

Thank you all.
