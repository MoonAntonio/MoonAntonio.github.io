====================================================================
I. Welcome to Monk.

It is pretty much fact, that by most NA players Monk is one of the
more overlooked jobs. It's not "advanced", we get no damn "circles"
abilities or "killer" traits. We just do damage. It is a pretty
simple class to play, however still possible to screw up. Wielding
a set of knuckles, a monk attacks twice per round. These two
attacks are actually considered as one by the game. Boosting before
battle gets your first series of attacks a boost in damage. NOT just
the first punch. (I've done extensive research on this.) Well, that
said. Let's see what this "simple" job has going for it.

====================================================================

II. This is version 
.1 More revisions will be forthcoming as they are deamed necessary.
.2 Added a question and answer to the FAQ chapter.
.3 Fixed a spelling error, added the to be more updated, Equipment
section.
.4 Added an AF How to guide, under Equipment.
.5 It seems I left out a whole damned section "Playing as a Monk"
>.> That's now corrected.
.6 Added a FAQ, Added Artifact II Armor Stats and Location
.7 cleared up a few typos
.8 Added in Tourney Patas (40)
.9 With the new Oct-Dec 2004 Update I added the equips that I thought
should take over the "old" equips position. (What's better for you.)
Also, added in Black Belt quest how to, since I literally had to 
figure out how to do it myself. (Yea, I got my Black Belt ^_^) Also
added Monk/Samurai/Ninja cursed gear. Shura set. Also added God
Armor.
.99 Small word changes.
====================================================================

III. Job Abilities
  
Hundred Fists - Level 1 - 2:00:00 timer - 1:00 Duration

If you've seen this, you know the beauty of it. Hundred Fists is
awesome, there's no way around it. Assuming you can actually hit
the target, it not being IT+++, this will take a significant chunk
out of a target's HP. However, it will draw hate onto you, so the 
healer had better be prepared to shell out some cures. Use this for
a chain 5, or if your group maybe pulls a link into camp.

Boost - Level 5 - :15 timer - 3:00 Duration

Many monks don't know if boost is worth it or not. Yes, it can seem
repetitious to keep boosting while the puller is out getting a new
mob. I can only tell you that it is indeed worth it. It is even more
worth it when you get Chi Blast, which is highly effected my how
many times you've boosted, and yet even more worth it when you get 
you AF gloves (Temple Gloves) which increase the power of boost yet
further. Please boost before new fights, I would not recommend boosting
during fights, as it slows do your attacks, unless you, for some reason
are tanking. Boost draws small aggro, and a Monk tanking can use
that to an advantage.

Dodge - Level 15 - 5:00 timer - 2:00 Duration

Dodge is what is says. Once every 5 minutes, for 2 minutes you get a
slight evasion increase. The increase strenghtens with AF boots
(Temple Gaiters), this is primarily a hate generating tool for when 
you're tanking. There really is no reason to use it otherwise. The
evasion bonus isn't too noticeable, and especially not to IT monsters.

Focus - Level 25 - 5:00 timer - 2:00 Duration

Focus is a beautiful thing. It noticeably increases you accuracy for
two minutes. Use this as soon as it's up.

Chakra - Level 35 - 5:00 timer - Instant (on self)

Chakra is simply a healing ability. Your VIT multiplied by 2
(or 3 with AF body gear Temple Cyclas). Very good for farming, also
very good when fighting mobs with nasty AOEs.

Chi Blast - Level 41 - 3:00 timer - Instant (to monster)

Chi Blast, early on, is simply a means for the Monk to tack on more
damage as the mob is coming in to the camp. Chi Blast power is 
affected by how many times you've boosted in conjunction with your
MND stat. Late game, for HNM fights Monks are called on to use 
Boost and Chi Blast (along with as much MND gear as they can get their
hands on) to Chi Blast the HNM. Doing 700-1100 damage is NOT
uncommon. Use this ability whenever it's up, and properly boosted.
It's more damage done by you, the damage dealer.

Counterstance - Level 45 - 5:00 timer - 5:00 Duration

Counterstane drops you def down to 30-60, while greatly increasing 
your chance to counter. It's typically not worth it to use 
Counterstance unless you have a large amount of +counter gear
or the AF2 boots (Melee Gaiters) and even then. It's still more
of a personal preferance to use. You either like this ability, or
you don't. I don't use it that much, maybe when farming if I can 
remember, but I'd rather not play around with Counterstancing
on VT/ITs. That's just me.
======================================================================

IV. Job Traits

Martials Arts Level 1, 31, 46, 61, 75.
Unlike any other job save Ninja, Monk get their own built in Haste.
Monk's Hand to Hand fighting has a default delay of 480. The chart
below shows how your base delay drops, as your levels rise.
 
HTH Delay = 480 
HTH Delay with Martial Arts I [Monk Lv1] 400 
HTH Delay with Martial Arts II [Monk Lv16] 380 
HTH Delay with Martial Arts III [Monk Lv31] 360 
HTH Delay with Martial Arts IV [Monk Lv46] 340 
HTH Delay with Martial Arts V [Monk Lv61] 320 
HTH Delay with Martial Arts VI [Monk Lv75] 300 

As you can see, Monks get quite speedy come 61+ - 75. Tack on your
weapon delay (usally +86, +96, +112) and you have a not so bad
damage over time situation. ^_^

Counter - 10 - You will occasionally counter a mobs attack, directed
at you. (Will never hear anyone complain about this)

Max HP Boost - 15, 35, 55, 70. Ahh, what monks are known for before
the fights even begin. Is that an Elvaan WAR? No, it's a Taru MNK.
Monk get sick HP, which is very nice, considering we need an offset
to our pretty damn low defense. You Galka monks better get used to
being 150-400 HP above the next highest HP character in your party.

Kick Attacks - 51, 71. 
Kicks are completely random, but do generate TP and are an extra 
attack in the Monk's favor. They typically do roughly 1/2 of the
damage of a punch. Fun to watch, more damage on the mob, who can
complain?
======================================================================

V. Stat Equipment Importance

Being a damager dealer, the main purpose of the job is to (of course)
deal damage. However, Monk are the most straight-forward damage 
dealers in the game. No spells to debuff, no break WSs to use for
the benefit of the party, no acid/sleep etc arrows/bolts. Just 
straight out damage. That being said, Monk is pretty easy to go shopping
for. My list of importance for all Monks save Elvaan, and maybe Galka
goes STR>ACC>ATK>DEX. Elvaan would be ACC>STR>ATK>DEX, due to their 
high STR. Build your gear accordingly. Haste items are more often than
not, a luxury. If you can afford them, and can still hit hard and often
with them, more power to you.

======================================================================

VI. Job Combinations

First off, I'm just gonna list possible VIABLE combinations. Crap like
MNK/DRG is RIGHT OUT. (Don't give me that haste earring crap, it's 
RIGHT OUT!)

MNK/WAR - This subjob leads the Monk in it's highest dmg output w/o relying
on skillchains. Double Attack, Berserk, Warcry, Atk Bonus, Defense Bonus.
These things can not be disputed. However, there are situations when
you'll be forced to sub THF.

MNK/THF - Not worth it before 67. Gaining Steal, Gilfinder, and Sneak 
Attack. While discarding Double Attack, Berserk, Atk Bonus and Def Bonus
is not a choice you should willingly want to make. However after 67
in bones parties if there isn't a Dark Knight closing the Light 
skillchain. You WILL be asked to close it, and if you value your life
and the sanity of your Paladin and White Mage, you WILL sub THF (with
it being at least level 30, for Trick Attack) You don't sub THF in a bones
party, you die or AT LEAST have unnecessary cures burned on you while 
the Paladin tried frantically to get hate back, not to mention doing less
damage because both hits of your Dragon Kick aren't guarenteed to connect
like with /THF. (Also use /THF for farming. Treasure Hunter at 15, and
Flee (which is really fun) at 25. Why not just take the bugger to 30
for the Trick Attack? Right?)

MNK/SAM - I'm not a fan of it. Monks are already typically waiting for 
every other job besides RNG and SAM (maybe a non tanking WAR/NIN) to
get TP. Thus being at being at 175TP (due to your Store TP traits)
when the DRK, DRG, PLD and what have you get 100, isn't worth it. That 
extra TP means just about bugger. Try it sometime. Do a 100TP Howling
Fist. The a 175TP Howling Fist, the difference makes you wonder. ...and
Meditate then soloing your WS. >.> Why bother? Especially since this 
game is built on leveling off of things like crabs and beetles. As 
mentioned in the MNK/THF part. Come 67, if you're in a bones party, 
that MNK/SAM just don't play. Cuz now you're hitting too damn HARD.
Thus screwing up the hate system for the PLD, draining the healers MP, 
trying to heal our gross HP. Causing unnecessary agg on the WHM for
having to spam Cure IVs. It just doesn't fly...on bones MNK are Dragon
Kick closers or using Raging Fists to make Fusion for the DRK/THF.
And a DRK/THF no way, no how can keep up with a MNK/SAM in TP.


MNK/Mage - No. Only time a MNK/mage works is for HNM battles. The hard
ones. And that's MNK/WHM (MAYBE MNK/SMN) for the MND bonus. From, if 
you were paying attention, Chi Blast being directly related to MND
(and Boost). MNK/WHM with +MND gear = SICK Chi Blast dmg. Especially 
if the MNK is Elvaan, and to a lesser degree Galka.
========================================================================
VII. Playing as a Monk

Hit Control+A or type in /assist (name of tank here, minus parenthesis)
Congrats. You can now play as a Monk! 

Honestly folks, this is the easiest job in the game to play. There is
no debuffing, tanking, jumping, repeated skillchaining, or anything 
else the melee do except damage. The reason why Monks are so great at 
damage is because that's ALL they do. A good DRK will toss out some
Absorb spells or Aspir on the inevitable crab you're fighting. Dragoons,
well they're next simple, but they at least jump. We Berserk (if WAR
sub) and Focus. Dodge is an utter waste, Chakra only when hit by AOE,
Boost in battle is a no no unless you're trying to hold hate, and Chi
Blast is horrible unless Boosted up. That is the simplicity of the 
Monk. However, some thing that simple job = unfun or even "bad" job.
Simply not the case. All through my levels I never got tired of Monk.
Never "stopped for a break", LOVED pounding the hell outta things, and
did so in a sound, and better manner than many a Monk I've partied with.
The extras definately help. Boost before every fight while the puller is
out getting the mob. Once you get Chi Blast, boost then Chi Blast as the 
mob is coming in. However, please don't boost too high (post 54) lest 
you screw up the PLD getting hate. It is possible to do 300-500 damage
Chi Blast to the mob as it's coming in. A Paladin provoking after that,
means nothing. The Paladin would have to flash as well, as they should,
and even then you're on thin ice till full hate is established.

So, some extra steps to playing your job to it's pinnacle.
-Boost before all fights, but NOT during them.
-Boost Chi Blast mob as incoming, though don't get crazy.
-WAR subbers, if with a NIN tank and see NIN having trouble casting
Utsusemi, voke, take a few hits to let the NIN cast.
-If hit with a blind, or poison (paralysis after 58) attack/AOE try
telling the WHM not to worry about you. You have Chakra to clear that
out of your system. (Then use Chakra, thus saving them some MP)
-EAT YOUR MEATS, sadly I dont see this early on, Monk LIVE off STR.
EAT THEM MEATS!
-Keep your gear UP TO DATE. Sadly, yes this means take time out to
go and farm/fish/raise a craft. Please guys, just do it. You're so
much better of a Monk with better equips.

I'm sure I'll think of some more. That's it for now. Any suggestions?
Holler at me.

========================================================================
VIII. Listed Equipment

This is the list such as it is. Will update from time to time with any
new items that S-E adds. Also, please keep in mind, expensive things
like Cross-counters, Scorpion Harness and Peacock Charm, aren't expected.
They're just added into the list for completeness sake. This layout is
very similar to Effen's layout. (He has a FAQ on Allakazham, it's similar
because I agree on ALL of his choices. He seems very wise in the way of
the Monk. ^_^;)

Disclaimer of sorts: There are indeed many items in here that are not
mentioned. The Shura set, God Armor, HIGH gold smithing items, RSE1/2,
Diving Might earring, Triumph Earring, +1 lvl 72 Rings etc.
These are not mentioned for basically the following reasons. 1. They
all costs millions/are crafted from very very high level synthesis, or 
are God armor or Rare/Ex. I don't add these because I don't want to
insult the intelligence of my FAQ readers, you all know that you'd want
Byakko's Haidate for the 5% Haste, you don't need me to tell you which
god peices you'd want, I'm sure you're already drooling over them.
Likewise for the Shura set, especially for the Shura set because many
of it's peices are strictly judgement calls on how you'd like your Monk
to be. As far as Triumph Earrings, they cost millions, 2STR is never
worth millions. Alky Bracellets push it, they're barely worth the money
because you're adding 2STR for (on Seraph) 1.6mil. Once again though,
this is my judgement call, in these regards I ask you to make yours. 

Hand To Hand: 
Cesti(1), Ryl Ftm Cesti(10), Republic Knuckles (15), Impact Knuckles(32),
Mythril Knuckles(38), Tourney Patas(40), Pata +1(48), Tactician Magician's
Hooks(50) Cross-Counters (50), Bone Pata+1(56), Spartan Cesti(58),
Feral Fangs (66) > Avengers (68) Indra Katars (73) or Narasimha/Vishnu
Cesti (67)

Notes: First off, your AF1. As SOON as Oggbi hands them to you, DROP
THEM. They are complete crap, and you shouldn't even entertain the notion
of using them in an XP pt. (Yea you can still do AF quests if you don't 
have your Beat Cesti) This is how I figure Monk knuckles. On the skill
chain chart, 85% of the time, Monks are skillchain closers, typically
closing Fusion. With high dmg knuckles you, of course, get higher 
damage closing Fusion. Which leads to higher damage Fusion, which leads
to the mob dying faster, which leads to quicker XP. Monks attack fast
enough that they don't need a 0 delay weapon. Please purchase what's 
on the list. I can assure you, it is what's best for your Monk, and for 
your XP pt.

Newly added: Updated to show Indras and Nara Cesti, also Avengers as nice
as there are to look at are placed IMO on the same pedistal as Ferals.
The thing Ferals has over Avengers is, of course, the one damage, but
also more importantly. Ferals can be bought. Avengers are rare/ex drop
off of the Bomb Queen in Ifrit's, and she is a stingy one. Indras are
a semi-rare drop off of Steam Cleaner, a pot that is a sky trigger.
If you have sky, and your LS is going to be doing Gods, they'll need to
kill Steam Cleaner if they want his drop.(Gem Of the East) used to spawn
a god. Now as far as the Cesti go, I really can't recommend them, until
your delay drops to 300 base. That is to say 75. At 75 Cesti, to be
honest, rip mobs up. You lose a few dmg per fist, surprising not much, 
and a nice chunk off of your weapon skills, but good lord the attack 
speed.It gets down right crazy if you add your haste gear, and maybe
Haste from a RDM or WHM. Usually don't use Cesti in xp on anything 
other than bones, but it's not unheard of to use them for everything.
I do not add Kaiser/Koening. Koenig is only better from Ferals because 
of some acc, acc that is nice, but you don't need. Kaiser, have never
been sold on Seraph. They are a +1 of Koenig, which is a lvl 90+ synth.
Kaiser are beautiful indeed, however, not attainable.

Head: 
Bronze Cap(1), Hachimaki(8), Monk's Headgear(11), Merc. Hachimaki(20), 
Emperor Haripin(24), Merc Cpt Headgear(30), Voyager Sallet (41), AF
(56) [If you like "The complete AF look"], Melee Crown (75) or 
Optical Hat (70) depending on what you're doing.

Notes: Hairpin is nice, I don't expect you to have it. But at that low
of a level, DEX is your friend since ACC isn't around yet. Voyager Sallet
added Dec 9th 2004 has that nice +3STR, great for a Monk. Toss up 
between Opt Hat and Melee Crown, depending on your task. Whether you
need the accuracy or not, of course. (Crown is +5STR amongst other 
things.)

Body: 
Bronze Harness(1), Kenpogi(8), Power Gi(13), Beetle Harness(21), 
Merc. Cpt. Doublet(30), Jujitsu Gi(40), Shinobi Gi(49), Master Gi(55),
 Scorpian Harness(57)[Hope ya got $$], AF(58) 

Notes: Our AF body is beautiful, look forward to it. Before then get
yourself a Jiujitsu Gi at 40~ish, and if ya got some extra bucks. A
Masters at 55 for added D. No need for a Shinobi if you have Jujitsu,
it's just on the list for those Monks that don't have Jujitsu.

Hands: 
Any, Battle Gloves(14), Fed. Tekko(25), Hume RSE [if you're Hume of course]
(27), Gigas Bracelets (30), Ochiudo Kote(34), AF(54), Pallas's Bracelets (60),
Alkyoneus's Bracelet(70) 

Notes: Definate pick up them Battle Gloves. Gigas Bracelets have nice
+HP and +STR come level 30 if you wish to gettem. As far as Ochi's Kote.
There is so indistinguishable difference between Ochi's and AF gloves
that I just sold Ochi's and used the 700k (at the time) and put it 
towards my Spectacles fund. Alky Bracelets at 70, are PLENTY rare, and
plenty expensive. 2 mil on Seraph. Got my pair from killing the NM 
(w/ help of course, thanks Gork) these haven't been sold in a month
on Seraph, they're THAT damn rare. o.o;

Legs: 
Bronze Subligar(1), Sitabaki(8), Linen Slops(12), Beetle Subligar(21),
Republic Subligar(25), Jujitsu Sitabaki(37), Shinobi Hakama(49), Master
Sitabaki/+1(53), AF(60), Rasetsu Hakama(72) 

Notes: Straight forward. Make sure to pick up Republic Subligar. Has
a decent +ATK. Wear that for as long as you like, and aren't taking hits.
Because the other Legs are pretty much just more D/for the looks. AF is
debatable. Whether you wanna stick to Master Sita +1 or AF is up to
you, and depends on how you like the look/how you play.

Feet: 
Bronze Leggings(1), Kyahan(8), Light Soleas(13), Beetle Leggings(21),
Windurstian or Fed. Kyahan(25), Merc. Cpt. Gaiters(30), Fuma Kyahan(39),
AF(52), Rasetsu Sune-Ate(72) or Fuma Sune-Ate (72) or Melee Gaiters (71)
Once again, it all lies in what you're doing...that dictates what you
need.

Notes: Pretty straight forward. I don't have the "Kung-Fu Shoes" series
in here. They have a hidden effect to increase kick damage, but are
SO rarely on the AH that they aren't even worth mentioning. If you get
tired of Orange, at 72 you can buy the Rasetsu boots, some +ATK.
Usually I just wear the whole Rasetsu set or the whole AF set. They
look stupid mixed. (Also, I'm not a big fan of Fuma, give me AF boots)

Belt: 
White Belt(1), Purple Belt(18), Brown Belt(40), Life Belt(48), Black
Belt(70)

Notes: ACC > Haste. Those are my "words of wisdom". Once you find that
your attacks are being missed. Then try removing Life Belt for Brown.
If you still hit well (or have 2 Sniper's) then Brown Belt can stay on. 
About the Black Belt, oh man what a trip that thing is to get. You won't
get it at 70. 75 More likely, since you need to kill 3 HNM (King versions
drop the items 100%) WELL worth it!

Earring: 
Bone Earrings +1 (16), Beetle Earrings +1(21), Spike Earrings(55),
Tortoise Earring+1 [if you can find them] (45)Coral Earrings(63) 

Notes: Nothing hard here, +ATK earrings all the way. 

Necklace: 
Spike Necklace(21), Peacock Charm(33), Spectacles(59), 

Notes: Spike Necklace is your friend. STR is more important that ATK.
STR, not only is a calculation of ATK, it also *gasp* raises your
STR. (ATK *gasp* doesn't raise your STR) Specs are entirely up to you.
The sure were nice to have for me, but if you feel you don't need them,
then give it a try w/o them.   

Rings: 
Courage Ring(14), Puissance Ring(36), Sniper's Ring(40),
Sun/Victory Ring(54), Ruby Ring (72) 

Note: I have Sniper's Rings in there. Because some Monks like to get
their +acc out of the Rings slot, and use Brown Belt. Of course,
this way is also more expensive, but viable. Either way you should
have either 2 sniper's or a Life Belt. You decide, how you want to
play it.

Back: Wolf Mantle +1 (28) > Amemit Mantle (61)

Note: If +Agi, or +Eva is your thing, feel free to go that route.

PT Needed: Basically just an XP PT to do some Helm Beetles, but DS
requires 6~ish ppl 55+. Of course, the higher the better.

AF Quest: Garlaige Citadel Coffer
Lvl req/conditions: Having completed Boghertz's Gloves AF quest.
AF Name: Temple Crown (Head)
AF Stats: Lv56, Def 21, HP +16, MND +5, Enhances 'Focus' effect
How to: The Coffer Key drops off of Fallen Mages, Fallen Majors, Wraith
Hellmine, Over Weapon, Vault Weapon, Magic Jug, and Tainted Flesh. I 
recommend sticking with the first two. The most abundant, and you hit
hard on skeletons. Once you have the coffer key you need to go behind
the 2nd/3rd Banishing Gates. The map is on
http://mysterytour.web.infoseek.co.jp/ffxi/us/index.html under Map1
Garlaige Citadel. (better than trying to explain the spawns). You 
WILL need 4 people to get you behind the gates, and their are platforms
you need to stand on.

AF Quest: Beadeaux Coffer
Lvl req/conditions: Having completed (or even started?) Boghertz's
Gloves AF quest.
AF Name: Temple Cyclas (Body)
AF Stats: Lv 58, Def 41, HP +20, VIT +3, Accuracy +5, Enhances 'Chakra'
effect.
How to: The Coffer Key drops off of Darksteel Quadav, Sapphire Quadav,
Ancient Quadav and Platinum Quadav. Once you get the key the coffer area 
is very close, and very easy (though you might have to eat a death)
Once again, check MysteryTour for the map. (You have the Beadeaux map, 
right? If not, buy it in Bastok)

How to upgrade your knuckles:

Relic Knuckles + Koh-I-Noor, Griffon Leather, and Adaman Sheet
= Militant Knuckles 

Militant Knuckles + ? = Dynamis Knuckles 

Dynamis Knuckles + Attestion of Might = Caestus 

Caestus + Mysitc Fragment = Sparhai. 

To make Koh-I-Noor, a 10million gil item that is an HQ3 of the Sparkling
Stone dropped in all Dynamis, you need XXXX amount of Byne Bills.
I'm currently working on just how many Byne Bills, I do beleive it's 300
or 400. Though, I could be very wrong. Also working on the forumula to 
make Militant Knuckles in Dynamis Knuckles.

========================================================================
Vd. Dynamis Explination:
========================================================================

For those of you that don't know what Dynamis is, you need an alliance of
AT LEAST 30 people if you hope to clear an area. There are 6 areas.

Dynamis - Bastok (Takes place in the Bastok Mines)
Dynamis - San D'Oria (Takes place in Southern San D'Oria)
Dynamis - Windurst (Takes place in Windurst Walls)
Dynamis - Jeuno (Takes place in Ru'Lude Gardens)
Dynamis - Beaucedine Glacier
Dynamis - Xarcabard

Upon leveling to level 65, if you visit Xarcabard you will be treated to 
a cutscene with Raogrimm. (Assuming you've defeated the Shadow Lord)
You may now enter Dynamis from the Trail Markings spots in the area
above that I've mentioned. You trade a perpetual hourglass, which is 
purchased for 1,000,000 gil from the Goblin in Castle. Oztroja, trade this
hourglass to the trail markings. If it's your first time to that Dynamis
you will get a cutscene. Congrats, you're now in the chaos that is Dynamis.

I can only recommend, as a Monk, going there at 70+. And to be honest, most
Dynamis Linkshells require you to be 70+. Honestly,  65-69 you can't hit a
damn thing. 70 you start to do well, at 75 you're on easy street. In Dynamis
every mob you fight has a job, and uses two hour when at a certain amount of
health. There are even jobs that you've never seen before Orc Ninja and such.

I won't go into further detail, because this isn't a Dynamis FAQ. It's a Monk
FAQ. I will impart some advice to the Dynamis bound Monks. Sub Ninja. These
Dynamis area are FULL of vicious AOEs (from statues, and the []Mega Boss[])
subbing Ninja will make your party WHM very happy, also your party PLD.
The WHM needs to worry about curing the PLD, not your ass. Subbing NIN helps
this as much as it can be helping. Utsusemi:Ni come 74 is preferrable, but 
honestly even Ichi is fine. Another tidbit, for Ninja and Thief mobs don't 
bother using Raging/Asuran Fists unless you're a Focussed 74-75. Stick with
Dragon Kick or Howling Fist. Keep an eye out for the PLD and THF two hour.
You, of course, can not hurt them unless you're a mage at this time. When
you defeat the []Mega Boss[] where the boss was defeated a ??? will appear.
You must click this if you haven't cleared the area already. This will
give you a key item and change your title to Dynamis <enter defeated area here>
Interloper. You must defeat Dynamis Bastok, San D'Oria, Windurst, and Jeuno
to gain access to Dynamis Beaucedine. Pretty sure you must beat Beaucedine
to get to Xarcabard.

========================================================================
Ve. The Black Belt:
========================================================================

1. Prereqs: Have your high Norg fame (Riceballs @144 for me) Have completed
Purple Belt, and Brown Belt quests.
2. Talk to Vola, you'll get a small cut.
3. Go to leave Neptune's Spire the way you came in.
4. When you open the door to leave you'll get a cutscene with Atori-Tutori
he will tell you the items you need. (Wyrm Beard, Behemoth Tongue and 
Adamantoise Egg)
5. When you aquire the Wyrm Beard walk up to the door in the main hall of
Neptune's Spire (the one with the first Tenshodo member you see behind it.)
6. Trade the Wyrm Beard to the door, you'll get a cut with Atori-Tutori,
he will tell you clues, who you want to talk to next is Degenhard in Bastok
(I-10 in Bastok Markets) you will get a small cut with him, I beleive he
should tell you to aquire a Behemoth Tongue.
7. Next, when you get the Behemoth Tongue. Again trade it to the door 
(I don't think you'll get a cut [I traded two at the same time]) you'll
remember from your cut with Degenhard that he mentioned his friend Maat.
(We ALL know who Maat is.)
8. Go talk to Maat (Ru'Lude Gardens I-6) you will get a cut with him, he
tells you to get an Adamantoise Egg.
9. When you have gotten one, trade it to the previously mentioned main hall
Neptune's Spire door.
10. You will be asked to trade your Brown Belt to the door also. Trade your
Brown Belt to the door, and prepare to be entertained =p That's it, you now
have the Black Belt.

Keep in mind, you only talk to Vola once. All the other transactions are to
the main hallway door (not the door to get into the place by the Mithra clerk,
the one further back.) Also, I had the tongue and beard and I can not remember
which I traded to the door first, I beleive it was the Beard, if not, then
definately the Tongue. Just switch their orders. Enjoy that belt, I know I am.

========================================================================
Vf. Shura Set (Dryadic Abjuration Set.)

First off please tell me if you know of an error with which God/HNM drops
which abjuration. My information may not be complete as far as drops.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dryadic Abjuration: Head

Cursed Kabuto makes Shura Zunari Kabuto
Lv 73 Def 20 HP-25 STR+5 Accuracy+5
 
Cursed Kabuto -1 makes Shura Zunari Kabuto+1  
Lv 73 Def 21 HP-30 STR+6 Accuracy+6
 
Dropped off of: Aspidochelone, Seiryu.

Ingredients/Skill needed to make the Cursed Kabuto:
Woodworking 97

Items needed: Earth Crystal, Ancient Lumber, Divine Lumber 
Animal Glue, Urushi, Zunari Kabuto

Comment: Not bad...Opt Hat for accuracy but if you ever don't need the 
accuracy there's this or the Melee Crown for +5STR on ya. Dunno if it's 
worth the money for the ingredients, though.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dryadic Abjuration: Body

Cursed Togi makes Shura Togi
Lvl 73 Def 40 HP-50 Acc. +10 Atk. +20

Cursed Togi -1 makes Shura Togi +1
Lv 73  Def 41 HP-55 Acc. +11 Atk. +22
 
Dropped off of: Kirin

Ingredients/Skill needed to make the Cursed Togi:
Woodworking 99, Leathercraft: Unknown but supposedly needed

Items needed: Wind Crystal, Ancient Lumber x2, Divine Lumber x2
Urushi, Animal Glue, Tiger Leather, Hara-Ate

Comment: Also prettttty nice. The Acc is lovely, the Atk never hurt, it's
just a matter of choosing this Melee Cyclas (for soloing maybe?), Scorp
Harness (also for soloing, due to evasion), or Osode for raw power w/
no Acc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

Dryadic Abjuration: Hands

Cursed Kote makes Shura Kote
Lv 73 Def. 16 HP-20 Acc. +4 Enhances "Resist Paralyze" effect

Cursed Kote -1 makes Shura Kote+1
Lv 73 Def. 17 HP-25 Acc. +5 Enhances "Resist Paralyze" effect 

Dropped off of: Suzaku

Ingredients/Skill needed to make the Cursed Kote:
Woodworking 96

Items needed: Wind Crystal, Kote, Divine Lumber, Ancient Lumber 
Animal Glue, Urushi

Comment: Crap. The Acc is nice, the Resist enhace is a joke. +5Acc
over the +STR bracellets/gloves (or +Atk if that's your thing)? 
No thanks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

Dryadic Abjuration: Legs

Cursed Haidate makes Shura Haidate
Lv 73 Def. 30 HP-35 STR+5 Acc.+7

Cursed Haidate -1 makes Shura Haidate +1
Lv 73 Def. 31 HP-40 STR+6 Accuracy+8
 
Dropped off of: Byakko

Ingredients/Skill needed to make the Cursed Haidate:
Woodworking 93

Items needed: Earth Crystal, Divine Lumber, Animal Glue, Urushi 
Haidate

Comment: IMO the best peice in the set. We need STR, we get it here.
We need Acc, we get it here. Like all Abj set it all comes down to
"Is it worth the price, due to the fact that I can not sell it once
it's made." IMO that's a borderline question. Right now AF2 Pants w/
Dune Boots (More Kick Attacks from Pants, Harder Kick Attack from Boots)
is going just great. Even Byakko's is nice...yummy haste. Lots of
good pants for Monk, take your pick people.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

Dryadic Abjuration: Feet

Cursed Sune-Ate makes Shura Sune-Ate
Lv 73 Def. 16 HP-20 Acc. +4 Enhances "Resist Gravity" effect

Cursed Sune-Ate -1 makes Shura Sune-Ate+1
Lv 73 Def. 17 HP-25 Acc. +5 Enhances "Resist Gravity" effect 

Dropped off of: Aspidochelone, Byakko 

Ingredients/Skill needed to make the Cursed Sune-Ate:
Woodworking 94

Items needed: Wind Crystal, Divine Lumber, Animal Glue, Urushi 
Sune-Ate

Comment: Crap. The Acc is nice, teh Resist Gravity is a joke. Boots are
a weak spot for Monk. Probably best off with AF2 when soloing stuff you
think you can counter, and Dune Boots for power. (Maybe some Fuma Sune's
for that haste...)


========================================================================
Vg. God Armor
========================================================================

I add this section on request, it's probably nice to have it seeing as 
Monk benefit from a good many God Armors. May I also say, unlink Shura
this entire set looks GREAT.

IX. Frequently Asked Questions

Feel free to send me your questions. There are some FAQs on other forums.
If you need my opinion on what to do I'd be happy to add it into the FAQ.
Typical questions are:

"What's the best race for Monk?"
Answer: Elvaan > Galka > Mithra = Hume > Taru.
Explination: Elvaan have the highest STR, and the highest MND. The
difference between an Elvaan Monk and a Mithra, Hume, Taru Monk of the 
same level with the same gear (like that ever happens) is pretty 
noticeable. Difference between Elvaan and Galka, in both categorys isn't
that noticeable. Keeping in mind there is nothing wrong with being any
kind of Monk so long as you respect yourself enough to always have the
best equipment you can get, w/o going crazy (Peacock Charms, Scorp
Harnesses and what have you). Also, please keep in mind, I'm a Mithra.
^_^; not biased to the Elvaan at all. Just stating what I see to be fact.

"Why do I get picked last for parties?"
Answer: Because pre-60 in the cookie cutter leveling places that many 
people have set in their minds. Distortion is THE skillchain. Monks can
NOT makes Distortion before 60.
Explination: Get used to making your own parties, and doing second hand
skillchains till 60. (Cept on beetles, they're weak to Fusion.) People
love to level on the crabs. They think there's "no other place to level"
Which is bull, they just don't wanna deviate from the proven semi-effective
norm. You get picked last for parties also, because many many players
like to see what I call "big stupid numbers" they'd rather see another 
job hit for 76 a swing, then a Monk hit for 40 each punch. This view 
changes VERY MUCH come "late game" when everyone is begging you to party
on the fastest XP in the game with them. (Bones with Light skillchain)
In the mean time, you're gonna have to suffer through it. Make your own
parties, and try and keep your chin up. 

Fox The Sly asks "I have a question though. Besides Meat Mithkabobs, what
other foods benefit Monks? At the Monk board on ffxionline, Red Limit
mentioned a certain food with a French sounding name (I forgot, sorry).
Do you know what I'm talking about? What benefits does that give?"

My reply: Yup, I do post on Ffxionline.com. Love there forums. As far as
alternative food, asides from Meats and Chiefs being the best (chiefs for
later lvls when you're pretty sure you aren't gonna die. >.> Don't ever
pop a chief in the dunes/qufim/jungle/garlaige.) The only real alternatives
are as follows 

Red Curry (I'll be damned if you EVER see these sell) +7 STR +2 AGI -1 INT
+24%ATK lasts 1hr 30min.

Dragon Steak (also never seen sold) +7STR -3INT +15%ATK lasts 1hour

and

Dragon Soup (seen a few sell, but if I remember correctly like the others
above, they don't stack) +6STR +2AGI +2VIT -1INT +11%ATK last 1 hour.

So, as you can see, the Miths/Chief pretty much crush the competition, in
price and availability.

The "french sounding name" I'll bet is an 'au lait' product. There are many,
they range in price from 200gil to 2.4-2.5k they are as follows. (please
note they're under []Drinks[] and can be drank whilst you have food on.

Orange au Lait HP+1/3sec 100hp gained 5minutes  <-- garbage

Apple au Lait HP+2/3sec 120hp gained 3minutes

Pear au Lait HP+3/3sec 300hp gained 5minutes

Pamama au Lait HP+2/3sec 400hp gained 10minutes

Persikos au lait HP+4/3sec 800hp gained 10minutes

A little secret, if you are soloing early on. I'd say lvl 7-15, these are
beautiful to have. Virtually ZERO down time, with Pamama and Persikos I dare
say you can even make your own exp chains. These are also particularly 
usefull for genkai 5. The Maat fight, which I will be adding to this FAQ
shortly. Keep the questions coming. ^_^

(from a recent post on the GameFAQs forums) "Which are better Ochiudo's
Kote or Temple Gloves?" 
(My reply in the post) First off, been there done that with the "Boost with
AF gloves, fight with Kote" crap. Just not worth your character blinking 
every damn fight so you can get a good strong Chi Blast off, and fight with
Kote on.

Second, it is my beleif that Temple Gloves > Kote 54+. Especially come 65+
you have TOO much damn atk (especially if subbing WAR and having Berserk,
eating meat miths) for 20attack to mean a damned thing. ATK caps, STR
doesn't. ATK is a function of STR!

I've also parsed this damage on various mobs. Bones, crabs, crawlers. The
damage from Kote seems to help WS damage bottom come up a bit, but straight
punching it's all Temple Gloves. (Though my Mithra ass uses Alkyoneus's
bracellets). +STR > +ATK for a Monk. 

It's just that at 34 when the Kotes become available the amount of ATK they
add outshines the STR you can get at that level, but rest assured as levels
rise, the returns diminish. If you're doing more damage with Kote then with
Temple Gloves on you still need to sell them Kote get your $$ and buy some
more +STR gear. A whole damn lot of it you could get with the price of them
Kote. (650+K)

Besides even if you are a +ATK freak Melee Gloves (AFII) > O. Kote. Though
I'd use those just to stack the "Enhance Chakra" on with Temple Cyclas.

"How does a Monk defeat Maat?"

I didn't add it in my monk faq because there are WAY too many ways to go
about it.

My way hasn't worked for but 2 people and I, my way specifically didn't
work for some people, there's too many damn ways to go about it.

Try mysterytour genkai 5 information.

Though if you need to know, what I did was:

Sleep to 100% TP with Opo-Opo Necklace
Boost 9, yes 9 times
Focus and Dodge
Engage turned around so as not to hit him
Activate 100 Fists
Chi Blast
Icarus Wing
Raging Fists 
Wait for TP from Hundred Fists 
Raging Fists

I don't mean to brag, but no one, but NO ONE has killed Maat, and had
as much HP left over as me, and I know every 70+ NA Monk. Try and 
beat my record of 580HP left over. ^_^ My friend Zeroth beat him in
record time, but only because he didn't sleep with Opo.

X. Credits

Thanks to the Gamefaqs.com board trolls for having me fall asleep laughing
every night. Keep up the funny XXX vs YYY threads! Thanks to the people 
in game that helped me get my Monk to were it is. ...and that's about it.
Take care. See you again!

XI. Summary

Monk is straight damage that can't make distortion till 60, and doesn't 
hit particularly hard on beetles, and is pretty much double wammied on
crabs. However, these set-backs make end game all the more bitter
sweet. Come 67, the XP just don't stop. You may not get too many JP
invites, but once you take some NA down into Gustav Tunnel and you're 
chain 4ing your first time there, everyone will decide that's where
they want to level. I've been invited solely because people wanted to lvl
there. I being the only NA Monk 67-74 at the time, there was little
option. It was if Kirei's on, get her. (Though I'm a guy, people call me
"her" because I am a Mithra) This is what you have to look forward to.
Struggle on to acheive it, because I guarentee, you won't be disappointed.
On a final note, as much as I'd like to help people out, please don't 
ask me to help with your Genkai and AF quests. Rather, you can ask, but 
don't be dissapointed if I can't come. Strangely enough, I'm usually
pretty damn busy in game. Leveling Ranger (next job), HNMs, Missions,
helping LS members, I'll try and help my fellow Monks, but I can't make
you any promises. ^_^; That said, enjoy the job. Eat your meats. Get
the best gear you can afford, while understanding that your gear, is 
your damage. Lastly, no matter the sub job you choose...KEEP IT 
AT 1/2 of YOUR MAIN! ^_^;
