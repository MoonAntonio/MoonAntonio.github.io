                                   Items

  This list is based on this file, which I assume was compiled from a hex
  dump of the ROM.  You may want to grab it, it includes info that can be
   used in cheat codes (I think), as well as dummy items and call beasts,
                          which are left out here.

  If it says a weapon deals '*something*' damage, it deals more damage to
enemies weak against the named element, and less to monsters strong against
  it. It might even heal monsters strong against that element. *something*
        could be Fire, Ice, Lightning, Water, Wind, Holy or Poison.

 Some of items may be missing battle or other effects. If you know of one,
                        be sure to tell me about it.

 Also, remember that this list was made based on the old patch for the FF5
ROM, so some of the items' names may be different from the ones you're used
             to. I'll add in the new item names sometime soon.
