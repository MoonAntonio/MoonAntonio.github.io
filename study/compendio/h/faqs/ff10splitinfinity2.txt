IV) PHRASE SEARCH ENGINE
=============================================================================
=============================================================================

Q1 - What is this? Why would I even need it?
A1 - With the guide at current state it becomes difficult to find what you're
looking for. This inspired me to create this phrase search engine (PSE).

Q2 - Okay, sounds good. What am I going to find in it?
A2 - What you will find here is an alphabetical list of every item, magic,
enemy etc. etc.

Q3 - Nothing special. I can make one of my own, if I wish...
A3 - What will be so special about this alphabetical list, you ask? Let me tell
you then. Each entry shall be given a specific code number.

Q4 - How is that going to help me jump straight to what I need?
A4 - Let's say you'd need a strategy to help defeat 'Optional boss'. So you
look into this list... you look up 'Optional boss' which would appear like
this:
...
Optional Boss - XBOSS
...
Take note of code number at the end. Now press CTRL + F at same time. In the
pup-up window type in XBOSS and press Enter twice to be taken to what you're
looking for. No hassle whatsoever. Speed satisfaction is guaranteed.

Q5 - There are few phrases which mean different things...?
A5 - No problem there. Such phrases will be marked by special code in
parenthesis. Find what it is here.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BB - Blitz tech          | C - Celestial wpn upgr. | SS - Special Sphere
KI - Key item            | WM - White magic        | I - Item
S - Status               | OS - Overdrive skill    | F - Fiend
S1 - Special command     | S2 - Skill command      |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q6 - Why are some phrases shortened to one letter only...?
A6 - By throwing a quick view in the list, you may notice that some names are
abbreviated. That's because these names are spoilers. The only way for these
entries to be included was like this.

Q7 - I can't find the thing I'm looking for in this part of the guide. Where is
it?
A7 - In the first part of the guide, found here:

30% chance to petrify him and 60% to darkness him; Poison would take 10% of
Tidus' MAX HP away each time he'd take an action; he'd die after 6 turns of

VI) ABOUT MONSTERS
=============================================================================
=============================================================================

This will by far take the largest piece of this guide. I made a similar guide
for FF8 about monsters, so I decided on doing another one for FFX as well.

*************************
Now for actual example...
*************************

1. Name: Tidus

2. Monster's HP: 5000 / 8000
--> Second number means damage you must inflict in finishing blow in order to
gain an Overkill

3. Monster's MP: 200

4. AP gained when monster is defeated: 2000 / 3000
--> So you would get 2000 AP should Tidus be killed without Overkill and 3000
AP should Tidus be killed with Overkill

5. Items stolen: Yuna / Lulu
--> That means Yuna is usual steal, and Lulu is rare steal

6. Items dropped: 1x / 2x Power Sphere; 1x / 2x MP Sphere
--> Usually you'd get 1x Power Sp., 2x if Overkilled. However, if you'd get a
rare drop, then you'd get 1x MP Sp., 2x if Overkilled

7. Gil earned: 1 (Scrooge:))

8. Items bribed: Dark Matter for 50000 gil
--> What item would you receive if you bribed that enemy. Bribe cost for PAL
version is monster's MAX HP x 10.

9. Monster's status info:
- Slow, Reflect, Zombie
- 30% Petrify, 60% Darkness
- 10% Poison
- 6 turns for Doom
--> In this case Tidus would be immune to Slow, Reflect and Zombie; you'd have
30% chance to petrify him and 60% to darkness him; Poison would take 10% of
Tidus' MAX HP away each time he'd take an action; he'd die after 6 turns of
being Doomed; and lastly, you'd have almost 100% probability of inflicting
*any* statuses not mentioned, for example Power Break, Silence etc.

10. Monster's stats info:
St, Df, Mg, Md, Ag, Lu, Ev, Ac
10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10
--> Pretty self-explanatory, eh?

11. Monster's el. info: Weak to fire, immune to ice, absorbs water
--> Tidus takes extra damage from fire based attacks, is immune to ice based
attacks, and absorbs water based attacks; finally, Tidus takes normal damage
from element based attacks not mentioned, in this case lightning and holy

12. Monster's Sensor info: Main character of the game.

13. Monster's Scan info: Name this character and win the game by defeating last
boss.

14. Monster's equip. dropped info: 2 - 4 slots, 1 - 3 abilities already
present, 50% probability of equipment piece being dropped
--> That means should Tidus be defeated, you'd get a piece of equipment with
number of slots ranging from 2 to 4 slots, this weapon having 1 to 3 abilities
already integrated into the weapon, and this weapon having 50% probability of
being dropped by that enemy

15. Weapon abilities: Str+20%

16. Armor abilities: Ribbon

17. Monster's attacks:
a) Blitz Ace - VS one chr - 9 consecutive hits + Darkness and Slow (former
inflicted for five chr's turns)
--> This means that Tidus' attack hit an enemy 9 times, inflicting Darkness and
Slow at the same time. Darkness will be lifted after five turns, whereas Slow
will remain permanently in effect.

18. Monster strategy: You want to defeat main hero of the game?:)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Is that okay? Now that you're set, few more pointers...

- monsters will be done in order of encountering them
- for abbreviations found in section 17. by particular monster refer to part VI
of this guide where you will find what certain abbr means

===========================================================================

001 - SINSCALE (Zanarkand) ---> A500

a) 'Bash' - VS one chr - phd
b) 'Wings start to flicker.' - signifies charge turn for Spines
c) Spines - VS one chr - extreme phd - requires one turn to charge
18. Monster strategy: As this is very first monster you'll encounter, you can
expect it not to be dangerous. In most cases it isn't, but in case its wings
start to flicker, kill that Sinscale soon. You can't pull anything fancy off
since the game has just begun, so only thing to do is to kill it fast and easy.

one hit.

12. Monster's Sensor info: Dodging its attacks is easier after inflicting

15. Weapon abilities: Distil Mana, Piercing, Waterst.
16. Armor abilities: Waterproof, Waterward
17. Monster's attacks:
a) Water - VS one chr - water mgd - may also cast it on itself to regain HP
18. Monster strategy: High Mag and Def. However, low Mdef. Lulu to the rescue.
Don't bother with physicals against Water Flan, as you'll just scratch it. Best
thing to use is Lulu's Thunder. It can also be easily silenced, thus removing
its only attack and letting it helplessly skip turns. Sometimes if low on HP,
Water Flan will cast Water on itself to replenish HP.
19. Special note: Water Flan is an armored enemy. Piercing and Armor Break are
the way to go.

18. Monster strategy: Very much the same as first Sinscale, except that stats
are higher.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

17. Monster's attacks:
a) 'Charge' - Suicide VS one chr - phd
18. Monster strategy: Careful with these around. These are last Sinscales
you'll see and also most annoying. Once a Sinscale charges you, it deals damage
and is then killed. However, it'll soon be replaced with new one. Although it
doesn't have much HP, it's not recommended to kill them. Concentrate on the big
target instead.

17. Monster's attacks:
a) 'Bite' - VS one chr - phd + Petrify and Silence (latter inflicted for three
chr's turns)
18. Monster strategy: Dingo-version, pure and simple. Agile, fast and high
Mdef. As with Dingo, it lacks Def. So Tidus is the way to go. However, its
'Bite' has two annoying statuses: it can petrify a character or silence
him/her. Keep Softs at hand.

11. Monster's el. info: Weak to ice
12. Monster's Sensor info: Aerial. Vulnerable to ice. Watch out for poison.
13. Monster's Scan info: Aerial and hard to hit. Use Wakka's attack to knock it
down. It's vulnerable to ice, so Blizzard is also effective. Attacks may
inflict poison.

17. Monster's attacks:
a) 'Sting' - VS one chr - phd + Poison
18. Monster strategy: As a flying creature with high Eva, who is most

use Lulu's Blizzard. Pay attention, tho'. Bee's regular attack can poison a
chr. Keep Antidotes around.

11. Monster's el. info: Weak to fire, immune to water
12. Monster's Sensor info: Vulnerable to fire.
13. Monster's Scan info: Watch out for its powerful Seed Cannon. One bad hit
will knock characters out. Plants tend to be weak against fire, so have Lulu
cast Fira. Kimahri can learn Seed Cannon.
14. Monster's equip. dropped info: 1-2 slots, 1-2 abilities already present, 6%
probability of equipment piece being dropped
15. Weapon abilities: Mag+3%, Piercing, Poisontouch, Str+3%

17. Monster's attacks:
a) Seed Cannon - VS one chr - phd
18. Monster strategy: Let's do some weeding. Plant, eh? I wonder if it's

to sleep is a good idea.

ice
12. Monster's Sensor info: Lightning elemental. Vulnerable to opposing element.

15. Weapon abilities: Distil Mana, Piercing, Lightningst.

a) Thunder - LATT VS one chr - lightning mgd
18. Monster strategy: One-element-only type of enemy. Uses certain magic only,
has high Def and Mag, but low Mdef, so Lulu is chr to use. For this element
Water will take care of it in no time. Remember, physicals are useless unless
you have Armor Break ability to crush its armor.
19. Special note: White Element is an armored enemy. Piercing and Armor Break
are the way to go.

12. Monster's Sensor info: Vulnerable to lightning.
13. Monster's Scan info: Ancient machina restored by the Al Bhed. Not a war
machine, but hits hard with its tool arm. Vulnerable to lightning, so Thunder

probability of equipment piece being dropped

17. Monster's attacks:
a) 'Arm stab' - VS one chr - phd
18. Monster strategy: What are robots weak against? Electricity. And this is
exactly what you should have Lulu use against it. Worker itself is not very
dangerous, as only attack it has is 'Arm stab', but it hurts. Unlike later
robotic enemies, stealing from Worker does not automatically kill it.

12. Monster's Sensor info: Dodging its attacks is easier after inflicting

11. Monster's el. info: Weak to ice, absorbs fire
12. Monster's Sensor info: Retaliates with Self-Destruct when attacked three
times.
13. Monster's Scan info: Retaliates with Self-Destruct against whoever attacks
it a third time. Use NulBlaze if you can't defeat it before then. Vulnerable to
ice, so use Blizzard. Kimahri can learn Self-Destruct.
14. Monster's equip. dropped info: 1-2 slots, 1-2 abilities already present,
15% probability of equipment piece being dropped
15. Weapon abilities: Distil Power, Firest., Piercing
16. Armor abilities: Fireward
17. Monster's attacks:
a) Fire - FATT VS one chr - fire mgd
b) 'Grow' - CATT - if Bomb suffers damage or gains health, it'll grow two times
c) Self-Destruct - FATT / CATT VS one chr - fire phd - if Bomb suffers damage
or gains health for third time, it'll use Self-Destruct vs chr that dealt third
blow - requires two 'Grow'-s to charge
d) 'Bash' - VS one chr - phd
18. Monster strategy: Another of memorable enemies from previous FF. Attack it
three times and it'll Self-Destruct. Gotta love it. As countermeasure cast
NulBlaze prior to that and you will suffer no damage. Otherwise Blizzard or
preferably Blizzara are the way to go.

And usually Funguar appears with magic users only, and magic doesn't wake up
your chrs once they're asleep. So whatever you do, make sure that the attack
you're about to use will subdue Funguar in that one hit.

12. Monster's Sensor info: Watch out for Earthquake, which hits all. Inflict
darkness to avoid its head butt.
13. Monster's Scan info: Watch out for its Eartquake, which hits all
characters. If a character is Swallowed, he will be unavailable until the worm
Regurtitates him back out. Try inflicting darkness and sleep.
14. Monster's equip. dropped info: 2-4 slots, 1-3 abilities already present,
50% probability of equipment piece being dropped
15. Weapon abilities: Mag+5%, Piercing, Slowtouch, Str+5%
16. Armor abilities: Auto-Potion, HP+10%
17. Monster's attacks:
a) 'Headbutt' - VS one chr - phd
b) Swallow - CATT VS one chr - removes chr from battle for so long until Sand
Worm is target of further five attacks - Swallow is used as counter after Sand
Worm has been targeted for total of 10 times
c) Regurgitate - removed chr is returned to battle - if removed chr was under
any positive statuses, they are removed, even Auto-Life
d) Readying Quake - signifies charge turn for Earthquake
e) Earthquake - NATT VS all chrs - mgd - used every seventh turn
18. Monster strategy: Phew. Powerful in terms of HP, but slow. Go for darkness
and sleep! Don't forget to poison it as well. 4500 HP lost can make a
difference. Interesting side note: while Sand Worm is prepping for Earthquake,
it's immune to Sleep.

Confusion and Darkness (Silence, Darkness and Slow are lifted after three chr's
turns)
b) 'Squirt' - VS one chr - phd
18. Monster strategy: My most liked enemy.:) Unlike Great Malboro, Malboro
doesn't use Bad Breath on first turn. Bad Breath is used after Malboro has been
a target of seven attacks (healing it also counts as an attack). Therefore,
after you hit it seven times, expect to see Bad Breath on first turn it gets.
You *should* have a protection against Confuse and Berserk. All other statuses
are manageable.

has been a target of three attacks, ie on first turn Demonolith reaches after
those three attacks
18. Monster strategy: Dangerous. Anything you do to Demonolith will prompt it
to counter with Pharaoh's Curse. Remove Poison at least. Its regular attack
puts Zombie and Curse on you. If that weren't enough, it has 'Stone breath',
which can petrify all of your chrs. You must have Stoneproof armors if you are
to stand a chance. Break its armor, then unload on it. Silencing Demonolith
disables its Pharaoh's Curse.

the way to go.

18. Monster strategy: Once you see a treasure chest (along with Zaurus), steal
from it. Sometimes it'll be empty, in which case it'll turn into a Mimic.
Defeat it and you'll get lots of Gil. Do not Mug from it. Even in case it would
be empty, doing this will destroy Mimic and will not net you gil reward.
Interestingly, you cannot use Copycat command during phase of battle where
Mimic is present.
Furthermore, for as long as you don't trigger Mimic to appear, you can flee the
battle. Once Mimic enters, Flee and Escape commands are sealed. Once Mimic is
defeated, Flee command is once again selectable.

SUBSECTION - ABOUT MONSTER BATTLES ---> A834
==================================

Featuring yet another section on monsters, this one is dedicated to random
battles, or more specifically, where can you find any and all fiends in the
game. Without any further blabber (but that's exactly what I'm still doing,
right?) here comes Monster Encounter informator. Boss fights (example: Crawler
battle) and tutorial battles (example: two Garudas on Besaid island) will be
left out. No longer will you need to search endlessly on where to find a
certain fiend.

=============================================================================
VII) ABOUT SIDEQUESTS
=============================================================================
=============================================================================

In this enormous section I will list information on many sidequests you can
undertake on in FFX. Some really big sidequests will gain section of their own.
So far Monster Arena and Dark aeons have been granted their wish.

---------------------
I - CELESTIAL WEAPONS ---> A089
---------------------

There's none among FFX players who didn't get frustrated over certain part of
this humongous quest. Personally I got annoyed as hell over lightning dodging,
chocobo racing and blitzball. But we all know, that anything can be
accomplished if you try hard enough (or are forced to, like I was for
blitzball... more on it later).
I'd like to start sidequests section with never-before-seen feature among FFX
guides (official ones don't count)... a complete and in-depth Celestial weapons
guide.
Yep, others have written it too, but they were only words... the thing that
separates mine from the others is that I will *show* you what to do as well.
Now, point me to a guide that has done that... Let's begin!

STEP 1 - CLOUDY MIRROR

Cloudy Mirror is the very first ingredient you need. Without it you cannot
start Celestial weapon (CW for short from now on) hunt. You can collect crests
and sigils, but you won't be able to open any chests/seals that hide CW. So
where do you get Cloudy Mirror? Train a chocobo in Calm Lands... well, you
don't even need to do that, just talk to chocobo lady and tell her you want to
ride a chocobo. Go to extreme southeast of Calm Lands and find the feather...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/primer24a.jpg

Once chocobo has jumped over, dismount it and cross the bridge to reach Remiem
temple. There are two chocobos near it, one on left, one on right. There's also
a sphere near left one, which you must examine...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/cloudym01.jpg

...before you're able to mount chocobo on the right...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/cloudym02.jpg

The other chocobo needs roughly 30 seconds to make it to the center ring, which
is more than enough time for you to win...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/cloudym03.jpg

Congratulations! What? It lost its power and there 'seems' to be a way to
restore it? Drat and double drat!

STEP 2 - CELESTIAL MIRROR

Okay, I'll power up the stupid thing... just don't think I'll do it for free.
Grrrr. Head on over to Macalania Woods. Find and talk to this woman...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/celestialm01.jpg

Waaaah, her husband is missing. Why would we care? Well, we need that mirror,
so you have no choice but to go here...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/celestialm02.jpg

Yay, family reunited forever... or is it...?
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/celestialm03.jpg

Just a bit to the left of the couple is this shiny path...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/celestialm04.jpg

On next screen you'll see another part of path branching off and at the end
you'll see the runaway kid.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/celestialm05.jpg

Talk to him and as sign of appreciation he'll let you obtain...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/celestialm06.jpg
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/celestialm07.jpg

Alright! This mirror opens ancient seals found throughout Spira... kind of. Now
you have all the means of obtaining all the weapons, all the crests and all the
sigils (well, for sigils I wouldn't be so sure as you'll surely get annoyed
when doing it, but it *is* doable).

STEP 3 - SAMPLE POWER-UP PROCESS

CW are best (this could be debatable) weapons for your seven playable
characters. They come in three parts: weapon itself, crest and sigil. When you
obtain the weapon, it's pretty weak. It has four slots, three of which are
empty and one being occupied with No AP ability (that means you will not get
any AP at end of battle). When you want to customize it, it says you can't.
WTF?
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/powerup001.jpg

You need respective crest and sigil, silly. In the pictures I used Rikku as an
example, so let's temporarily assume we got Godhand, Mercury Crest and Mercury
Sigil. You haven't forgotten where you got Celestial Mirror, right? Return
there and examine the big sphere...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/powerup002.jpg

You will be asked to present a certain chr's weapon. Choose Rikku...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/powerup003.jpg

For first upgrade you'll use Mercury Crest...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/powerup004.jpg

Let's see what happened with the weapon. No AP stayed, but Double Overdrive
ability was added (this applies for all 7 CW). Graaah... Mildly useful.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/powerup005.jpg

'Talk' to big sphere again, choose Rikku and offer Mercury Sigil...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/powerup006.jpg

After the second upgrade Godhand reaches its maximum!
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/powerup007.jpg

Here are the results of fiddling around with Godhand...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/godhandfinale.jpg

And here are ending abilities on CW of other chrs...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/masamunefinale.jpg
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/worldchampionfinale.jpg
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/nirvanafinale.jpg
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/caladbolgfinale.jpg
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/onionknightfinale.jpg
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/spiritlancefinale.jpg

STEP 4 - IN-DEPTH GUIDE TO OBTAINING CELESTIAL WEAPONS

#1A - TIDUS' CALADBOLG ---> A082
The weapon is found in Calm Lands. You may have seen a small path leading down
on extreme north of Calm Lands, but path is blocked by some guard.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/caladbolgpath.jpg

So we need to get rid of him. Talk to the chocobo lady and pick 3rd option.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/caladbolg01.jpg

After you successfully complete the first game, you'll be asked...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/caladbolg02.jpg

Select this course...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/caladbolg03.jpg

Successfully complete second game, and then choose this course...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/caladbolg04.jpg

...and finally this course...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/caladbolg05.jpg

Now you need to be *faster* than chocobo gal! It doesn't matter if she gets to
goal first, what matters is amount of baloons you collected and amount of birds
you hit. Once you have the faster time, choose to quit. Looksie... the guard
got interested...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/caladbolg06.jpg

Go to extreme north again and now go down the path, which was shown in the
first pic of this section. At the end you will notice a strange insignia on the
wall. Examine it and select 'Yes'...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/caladbolg07.jpg

Caladbolg is ours!
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/caladbolg08.jpg

#1B - SUN CREST ---> A578
It's in the room where you fought Y. woman...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/caladbolg09.jpg

...and chest with Sun Crest will appear!
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/caladbolg10.jpg

Note that you can return here later in the game, but there is just a small
matter of defeating Dark Bahamut first.

#1C - SUN SIGIL ---> A579
Again Calm Lands. Challenge chocobo lady to a race. You have to be *faster*
than 0.0.0. No, I'm not kidding. Yes, it's hard, but not impossible. If your
time is 0.0.0, you will not get Sun Sigil. You *have* to be faster than that.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/caladbolg11.jpg

A bit of explaining is necessary with two examples.
Example 1: Let's assume your time is 33 seconds, 12 baloons and 1 bird. 12
baloons shaves off 36 seconds, which would end in minus 3 seconds. But since
you were hit by 1 bird, this adds 3 seconds to your timer, thus ending at 0.0.0
exactly. If this would be the case, you WILL NOT get the sigil.
Example 2: Let's assume your time is 33 seconds and 12 baloons. 12 baloons
shaves off 36 seconds, which would end in minus 3 seconds. This means time
faster than 0.0.0, also resulting in you obtaining Sun Sigil.

#1D - FINAL RESULT
- Abilities on Caladbolg:
Triple Overdrive, Break Damage Limit, Magic Counter, Evade&Counter
- More HP Tidus has, more damage Caladbolg does

#2A - WAKKA'S WORLD CHAMPION ---> A640
Win a couple of Blitzball games (8 or so should be enough). When you have the
airship, go to the bar where Kimahri picked a fight with Ronsos before. Talk to
the bartender. If she says something like being even better, win some more
blitz games. But if you're greeted like this...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/worldchampion01.jpg

World Champion can't elude you much longer...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/worldchampion02.jpg

#2B - JUPITER CREST ---> A284
In Aurochs' locker room examine the lockers. One of them is hiding the crest.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/worldchampion03.jpg

#2C - JUPITER SIGIL ---> A285
Sigil will appear as a league prize once you've obtained all overdrives for
Wakka.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/worldchampion04.jpg
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/worldchampion05.jpg

#2D - FINAL RESULT
- Abilities on World Champion:
Triple Overdrive, Break Damage Limit, Double AP, Evade&Counter
- More HP Wakka has, more damage World Champion does

#3A - AURON'S MASAMUNE ---> A344
First item you'll need is Rusty Sword. Go to entrance of Cavern of the Stolen
Fayth. On this screen go right and up. At the end of the path you'll find Rusty
Sword.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/rustysword.jpg

Now return to airship and pick Djose Highroad destination. On this screen now
go thru southwest exit and you'll appear in Mushroom Rock. Follow the path
(you'll know you're going right if you'll run into 4x Soft chest on the way)
and take first left you'll come across. Activate the stone lift by pressing X.
Examine the statue and choose Yes when prompted.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/rustyinsert.jpg

Approach the sign that appeared and examine it...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/masamune003.jpg

...to obtain Masamune!
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/masamune004.jpg

#3B - MARS CREST ---> A342
Go to the place where S. convinced few guards to let you thru the barricade.
There's a path leading down and right.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/masamune001.jpg

Enter it and you'll be on Oldroad. Go all the way to the end and you'll find
Mars Crest in the chest.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/masamune002.jpg

#3C - MARS SIGIL ---> A343
Once you unlock combined total of 10 Species and/or Area Creations...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/masamune005.jpg

...you'll receive Mars Sigil from Monster Arena manager.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/masamune006.jpg

#3D - FINAL RESULT
- Abilities on Masamune:
Triple Overdrive, Break Damage Limit, Counter-attack, First Strike
- Less HP Auron has, more damage Masamune does

#4A - KIMAHRI'S SPIRIT LANCE ---> A557
Go to Thunder Plains. See those strange stones that glow sometimes? Approach
one of them (three in total) and press Square in front of it when it's glowing.
Do this three times (locations provided in pics below) and Qactuars will now be
fightable.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/spiritlance002.jpg
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/spiritlance003.jpg
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/spiritlance004.jpg

Now go to southern Thunder Plains. Hug the right until you see a broken pillar
of sorts.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/spiritlance005.jpg

Examine this 'pillar' with Square and Spirit Lance is yours.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/spiritlance006.jpg

#4B - SATURN CREST ---> A472
Go to Mount Gagazet where you fought Flux for third time. Remember a bunch of
pillars in the canyon not far from this battle point? Between one of them is a
chest with crest inside.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/spiritlance001.jpg

#4C - SATURN SIGIL ---> A473
In Macalania woods you'll need to complete *both* butterly mini-games after you
gain the airship. Do it successfully and sigil is yours. I stress again that
you need to complete both games. Proof below...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/spiritlance007.jpg

http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/nirvana003.jpg

As Tidus opens the chest, he's thinking: Yuna! Let's reach Nirvana together!
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/nirvana004.jpg

#5B - MOON CREST ---> A369
At Besaid Beach there's a small beach with chest, that houses Moon Crest.

accessible (it may be just me) is a chest with Onion Knight inside.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/onionknight002.jpg
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/onionknight003.jpg

http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/onionknight005.jpg

...and...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/onionknight006.jpg

--> And lastly, once you collect CW, crest and sigil for one chr, return to the
same big sphere-like thingey you used to get Celestial Mirror. Perform the
ritual and the weapon will be powered up.
Note: You *cannot* power up CW, if you have only the sigil for it. However,
weapon can be powered up, if you have only the crest. You can return later and
complete the upgrade with the sigil.
All of celestial weapons hold the innate ability of Piercing (discovered by
Terence).

----------------------
II - BUTTERFLY CATCHER ---> A078
----------------------

In Macalania Woods there is this minigame involving butterflies. Besides being
fairly useless and annoying there is one goal in this game - getting Saturn
Sigil for Kimahri's Spirit Lance. There are three times you can compete for
prizes: before defeating Spherimorph, after defeating Spherimorph and after you
have the airship permanently.

There's 2 butterfly minigames you can complete.

First I'll list the prizes you get for completing the games before defeating
Spherimorph.
- Butterfly game 1: 'Macalania Woods: North'
Time limit of 40 secs will lead you to 1x Ether.
- Butterfly game 2: 'Macalania Woods: Central'
Time limit of 40 secs will lead you to 1x MP Sphere.

Then for completion of games after Spherimorph's descent to Farplane.
- Butterfly game 1: 'Macalania Woods: North'
Time limit of 30 secs will lead you to 2x Elixir.
- Butterfly game 2: 'Macalania Woods: Central'
Time limit of 40 secs will lead you to 2x Megalixir.

And finally after you have the airship in your possession.
- Butterfly game 1: 'Macalania Woods: North'
Touch the multicolored butterfly and off we go. You have 30 seconds to find and
touch 7 blue ones. Touch any of red ones and you'll have to fight few monsters.
You can't afford to touch any of reds, otherwise you'll run out of time. Right
at start head back a bit and nab first blue butterfly that appears. Prize for
getting all seven blues is Teleport Sphere - in case 'north game' is the first
ne you completed. If you have already done the other one, you'll receive Saturn
Sigil.
- Butterfly game 2: 'Macalania Woods: Central'
Near the bird-dude there's multicolored butterfly. Touch it and let the games
begin. 30 seconds are yours for 7 blues. This is fairly easy except for the
last part where you have to make a turn left - there's four reds cramped
closely together and in 9/10 cases you'll bump into one of them. To top it off,
last blue butterfly is very close to the exit from this part of forest, so be
really careful how far you go. Prize for getting all seven blues is Saturn
Sigil, but only in case you already completed 'north game' as well. If 'central
game' is first one you accomplished, you'll receive Teleport Sphere.

---------------------
III - CHOCOBO TRAINER ---> A097
---------------------

Calm Lands... there's a lot to be done here. For starters let's get our hands
on the chocobo. On far north end of the Calm Lands there's a woman on chocobo.
Talk to her, choose 'I wanna ride one' or something close to that and training
shall begin.

Course 1 is called Wobbly Chocobo. Your goal is to finish the race under the
time limit by crossing the finish line between chocobo trainer and her chocobo.
Time limit is 12.8 seconds. Besting it or getting the same time will net you 1x
Elixir. Each subsequent time you best or tie your record you'll get 1x X-
Potion. Soooo, even the chocobo lady lies thru her teeth. Difficulty here is
that your chocobo will try swerving right and left at all times, so your job
will be to try and keep it steady. Winning this race opens...

Course 2 is called Dodger Chocobo. Your goal is to finish the race under the
time limit by crossing the finish line between chocobo trainer and her chocobo.
This time your chocobo will only be racing forward, but there'll be stuff
flying your way, so you should avoid it by turning left/right when necessary.
Time limit is 16.8 seconds. Besting it or getting the same time will net you 1x
Lv.1 Key Sp. Each subsequent time you best or tie your record you'll get 1x
Mega-Potion. Winning this race opens...

Course 3 is called Hyper Dodger Chocobo. Your goal is to finish the race under
the time limit by crossing the finish line between chocobo trainer and her
chocobo. Again your chocobo will only be racing forward, but there'll be even
more stuff flying your way, so you should avoid it by turning left/right when
necessary. Time limit is 18.5 seconds. Besting it or getting the same time will
net you 1x Lv.2 Key Sp. Each subsequent time you best or tie your record you'll
get 1x Ether. Winning this race opens...

Course 4 is called Catcher Chocobo. This time chocobo trainer herself
challenges you to a race. You start the race by southern entrance in Calm Lands
and finish the race close to northern exit of Calm Lands. There's a few
augmentations on the way as well. Each balloon picked up by you shaves off 3
seconds from your timer. Each bird that hits you adds 3 seconds to your timer.
What's bad and good about this is that same can also happen to your rival. To
even further annoy you, controls are pretty messed up... Time limit is 45.0
seconds. Besting it or getting the same time will net you 1x Lv.3 Key Sp. Each
subsequent time you best or tie your record you'll get 1x Turbo Ether.
Ultimately, you should aim for time *faster* than 0.0.0. If you manage to do
it, you'll receive Sun Sigil for Tidus' Caladbolg. I'd just like to put
something down, so this won't happen to you as it did to me. Anyway, in my
latest playthru I reached Calm Lands and decided to train a chocobo. As I got
to Catcher Chocobo course, I managed to get time faster than 0.0.0 on my first
try. I was thrilled, to say the least, but also worried about what I would
get... Lv.3 Key Sp., or Sun Sigil, or both? Luckily for us you get both
stuffs.:)

From now on, whenever you'll need to ride a chocobo, talk to trainer and she'll
provide a ride for you.

IV - BAAJ TEMPLE ---> A042
----------------

Once you've discovered Baaj Temple with coordinates found a bit below this
section, you're set. Main objective here is to obtain Anima.
When you 'appear', save at nearby save sphere. Now equip Tidus, Wakka and Rikku
with armors consisting of Deathproof, Stoneproof and Curseproof. Then proceed
to the end of pathway, jump in the water and try swimming toward the green
square. First obstacle will be your fishy friend from beginning of game:
Geosgaeno.

chr eaten is under any beneficial and/or negative status, that status will be
copied onto Geosgaeno

it ate back out onto remaining party members - damage dealt is calculated in
strategy below
e) 'Regurtitate B' - if chr eaten gets a turn before Geosgaeno does and you
choose Struggle, that chr will attack G-guy from inside - however, Geosgaeno
will counter by spitting that chr back out - damage dealt is calculated in
strategy below
f) 'Regurtitate C' - if chr eaten gets a turn before Geosgaeno does and you
choose Struggle, that chr will attack G-guy from inside - if this Struggle
kills Geosgaeno, it will counter by spitting that chr back out, dealing 9999
damage to all chrs

18. Monster strategy:
This fat fish is a very interesting enemy. Requires a bit of strategy, too.
Let's talk about it, then! Geosgaeno's KO and Stone Punch deal about 1300
damage, along with inflicting that annoying statuses which I assume you can't
be afflicted with cos of necessary protections.
On its third or fourth turn Geo loves to do 'swallow'. Now here's the big
catch: Whatever status swallowed character in under, that status/es will be
carried over to Geosgaeno! For example: Tidus has Protect, Shell, Haste and
Regen. If he gets swallowed, all of those statuses will be carried over to
Geosgaeno. Bad thing to happen!
Positive statuses you may copy: Protect, Shell, Reflect, NulTide, NulFrost,
NulShock, NulBlaze, Regen, Haste.
Negative statuses you may copy: Poison, Silence, Slow, Zombie, Armor Break,
Power Break, Mental Break, Magic Break.
However, if Tidus has Slow, Poison, Zombie etc., all of those statuses will be
carried over to Geosgaeno as well. Good thing to happen! I haven't managed to
Doom Geos., cos when I thought it'd eat one of my chrs, all it pulled off were
KO Punches. Guess you can't Doom it at all.
Ultimately, you could do this: inflict all characters with Zombie, Poison,
Regen. Then wait until someone gets eaten and voila! Geosgaeno successfully
doomed itself, hehehe. All you have to do is defend and heal yourself (cast
Curagas at zombied Geos. as well!) until Geosgaeno whittles down all of its HP
cos of the actions it's taking. You win and the entrance to Baaj Temple is now
wide open.
In case you'd like to beat this guy fair and square, you'll need to know the
following information: on first, second and possible third turn Geos. will use
Stone or KO punch. You must have Stoneproof and Deathproof armors or you'll
constantly be reviving. During this time attack or heal, doesn't matter. When
Geos. does 'Swallow', stop doing whatever you were doing and take under close
examination HP of the chr that got eaten. For this example I shall use Tidus.

'Regurtitate A' scenario: Tidus is swallowed with say 5000 HP. In case he gets
a turn inside Geosgaeno, he has only two options: Defend, which will forfeit
his turn, or Struggle, which will make Tidus attack Geosgaeno from inside. For
this scenario you should choose Defend. So Tidus will skip his turn. Afterwards
when Geosgaeno gets a turn, it'll spit Tidus back out and deal damage to all
chrs based on following equation:
([Eaten chr's current HP] minus [1] equals [damage dealt to all chrs])
So damage dealt would be 4999 to all three characters. Result would be: Tidus
left at 1 measly HP and other two chrs possibly killed.

'Regurtitate B' scenario: Scenery is exactly the same as in above example, but
this time have Tidus use Struggle. Geosgaeno will take damage, but then answer
with an attack, which spits Tidus back out, dealing damage based on following
equation:
([Eaten chr's current HP] equals [damage dealt to eaten chr])
So whatever HP Tidus would have, he'd be KO-ed.

'Regurtitate C' scenario: Scenery is exactly the same as in above example, but
this time have Tidus use Struggle. Also, this Struggle would have to kill
Geosgaeno. It will take damage, but will then counter with an attack, which
spits Tidus back out, dealing 9999 damage to all chrs. Everybody dies, and it's
Game Over. So, if you have a feeling that Struggle might kill Geosgaeno, don't
do it. Wait for chr to be available again, and *then* kill Geosgaeno for good.
Max dagame dealt this way is 9999 damage.

Now that Geosgaeno has been returned to the planet, proceed inside Baaj Temple.
When you reach Antechamber, you'll see six statues (three on each side of the
room) and a big 'poster'. Examine the poster and it will clue you in on
Destruction Spheres. You must have used Des. Sp. in each temple you visited so
far and opened the chest, which has been jinxed by Des. Sp. in each temple in
order to light up the statues. There's two chests here - one with 4x Mega-
Phoenix and other with 1x Megalixir.
Top left belongs to Besaid, middle left Macalania, bottom left Zanarkand, top
right Bevelle, middle right Djose and bottom right Kilika. By approaching the
statue it will light up, meaning you broke the seal for respective temple. BTW,
Bevelle statue will light up automatically, there's *no way* you could've
missed that one.
Picture support for this is here:
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/templebaaj01.jpg
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/templebaaj02.jpg
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/templebaaj03.jpg
If you followed my guide, you should've broken five seals already. Hmmm,
where's the sixth one? In Zanarkand Temple. Return there and again we deal with
Tetris. Real easy, tho' - you have to step on all of square shapes found in
both rooms. Once stepped on, Destruction Sp. will reveal itself. Nab it, then
go to the monitor in that other room. Insert DS in one of the holes. Collect
Magistral Rod and sixth seal is broken. Return to Baaj Temple and Anima is
yours. Damn, I never knew that about S... Once she's finished rambling, return
the way you came in here. When you're in the pool where you wasted Geo, swim to
the surface and press Square to get out of the water. Examine save sphere and
beam up to continue your adventures...

-----------------
V - REMIEM TEMPLE ---> A456
-----------------

Once you can ride chocobos, nail one in Calm Lands. Go to southern entrance and
go right from it. You'll see a yellow feather in the ground. While riding a
chocobo, step over it and press X to jump the gap. Dismount, go right and
you've reached Remiem Temple.
Here there's six things to be done:
- obtain Vol. XXIV *KEY ITEM*
- obtain Magus Sisters
- another chocobo race
- obtain Flower Sceptre
- obtain Moon Sigil
- obtain Cloudy Mirror

# Vol. XXIV *KEY ITEM* stuff-to-do
Real simple. Proceed further down the path past left chocobo and pick up the
Primer edition.

# Chocobo race & Cloudy Mirror stuff-to-do
You may have noticed weird shapes beneath R. Temple. This is a racing track for
chocobos. There's a chocobo on the left and chocobo on the right. First examine
the sphere which is located near chocobo on the left. Once you're told what to
do, you should be interested in right chocobo. Examine it with X, choose to
ride and prepare. Your goal is to reach the center of the circle first with as
many chests you can open on the way and the least poles touched on the way.
Prizes are as follows:
- first win, doesn't matter what happened: Cloudy Mirror
- win with one opened chest, no poles: 1x Elixir
- win with two opened chests, no poles: 1x Megalixir
- win with three opened chests, no poles: 30x Wings to Discovery
- win with four opened chests, no poles: 30x Pendulum
- win with five opened chests, no poles: 60x Three Stars
- winning with whatever happens afterwards: 1x Potion

# Flower Scepter & Moon Sigil stuff-to-do
Inside the temple you'll meet Belgemine. Now she'll tell you who she really is
and offer a challenge - if you manage to waste all of her Aeons, you'll receive
Moon Sigil.
You'll have to defeat Valefor, Ifrit, Ixion, Shiva, Bahamut, Anima, Yojimbo,
Magus Sisters. First five you have to defeat in order listed, while Yojimbo and
Anima appear as you get them. Magus Sisters will appear last, ie after you get
them from Antechamber behind Belgemine.

LEVEL 1 - VALEFOR BATTLE

1. Boss' HP / HP Overkill; MP
20000 / 20000; 500

2. Boss' status info:
- Immune to every negative status, including Eject and Demi
- NS
- Immune to Poison
- Immune to Doom

3. Boss' stats info:
St, Df, Mg, Mf, Ag, Lu, Ev, Ac
20, 10, 18, 10, 21, 15, 0,  0

4. Boss' el. info; Sensor info; Scan info
NS; Immune to Sensor; Immune to Scan

5. Boss' attacks:
a) 'Strike' - VS one chr - phd
b) Energy Ray - STATT VS one/all chr/s - std
c) Energy Blast - STATT VS one/all chr/s - std
d) Sonic Wings - VS one chr - phd + Delay effect

6. Boss strategy:
As Valefor is first Belgemine's aeon you'll be fighting, she isn't too tough,
but she ain't too easy either. Main point of being careful are her Sonic Wings,
which beside dealing damage can also delay your aeon's next attack a bit. If
she kept using Sonic Wings, you'd lose. She is also capable of using Energy Ray
at any of her normal turns. When her Overdrive is full, Energy Blast is used.
For fighting I recommend using currently your fastest aeon, which would be
Shiva. In case you can teach your aeons abilities, teach Shiva Haste and
Cura/ga. As she is summoned, use her normal attacks to strike Valefor down. If
Valefor's gauge gets full, use Shield. And that's that.

For advancing past level 1 for the first time you receive 4x Lightning Gem. In
case you missed fighting Belgemine's Ixion on the road to Moonflow, you'll
receive Summoner's Soul *KEY ITEM* first, and then 4x Lightning Gem. Beat
Valefor any time afterwards as many times as you want and you'll receive 4x
Power Sphere.

LEVEL 2 - IFRIT BATTLE

1. Boss' HP / HP Overkill; MP
28000 / 28000; 800

2. Boss' status info:
- Immune to every negative status, including Eject and Demi
- NS
- Immune to Poison
- Immune to Doom

3. Boss' stats info:
St, Df, Mg, Mf, Ag, Lu, Ev, Ac
23, 10, 21, 1,  18, 15, 0,  0

4. Boss' el. info; Sensor info; Scan info
Absorbs fire; Immune to Sensor; Immune to Scan

5. Boss' attacks:
a) 'Swipe' - VS one chr - phd
b) Hell Fire - FATT VS one/all chr/s - fire mgd
c) Meteor Strike - STATT VS one chr - std

6. Boss strategy:
Just a bit stronger than Valefor, Ifrit is a manageable guy. Since you now
possess Summoner's Soul regardless of what you did in your current game, teach
Shiva Haste, Protect, Cura/ga, NulBlaze.
Summon her for this battle as well. First cast Haste, followed by Protect, then
proceed with normal attacks against Ifrit. If he wears Shiva's HP down, use
Cura/ga to heal. Ice type spells will also do nice healing if you don't have
Cura/ga. Prior to Ifrit's Hell Fire (ie, if he manages to pull one off) cast
NulBlaze. Heheh.

For advancing past level 2 for the first time you receive 30x X-Potion. In case
you missed fighting Belgemine's Shiva in Calm Lands, you'll receive Aeon's Soul
*KEY ITEM* first, and then 30x X-Potion. Beat Ifrit any time afterwards as many
times as you want and you'll receive 5x Mana Sphere.

LEVEL 3 - IXION BATTLE

1. Boss' HP / HP Overkill; MP
30000 / 30000; 720

2. Boss' status info:
- Immune to every negative status, including Eject and Demi
- NS
- Immune to Poison
- Immune to Doom

3. Boss' stats info:
St, Df, Mg, Mf, Ag, Lu, Ev, Ac
22, 1,  23, 1,  17, 15, 0,  0

4. Boss' el. info; Sensor info; Scan info
Absorbs lightning; Immune to Sensor; Immune to Scan

5. Boss' attacks:
a) 'Swipe' - VS one chr - phd
b) Thor's Hammer - LATT VS one/all chr/s - lightning mgd
c) Aerospark - VS one chr - phd + Dispel effect
d) 'Ixion evades!' - this note means that Ixion has now become hard to hit
physically as he poured all his energy into evasive measures
e) 'Ixion defends!' - this note means that Ixion used Shield command

6. Boss strategy:
Use Shiva yet again. Ixion's Str is a cinch lower that Ifrit's, so you're
looking at the roughly same guy with different attacks. At start of battle use
Haste on Shiva. But Haste only, don't bother with Protect. Ixion can use
Aerospark on his normal turn, which will dispel all positive statuses on Shiva
- that's why it's better to bother with only Haste.
On some of Ixion's normal turns you'll see one of two notes pop up on screen.
If it's about evading, use magic attacks on Ixion or Heavenly Strike. If it's
about defending, don't attack, instead check up on Shiva. If she needs to be
healed, use cure spells or ice spells. Otherwise recast Haste if she isn't
hasted already, or Haste was dispeled. If Ixion manages to get Overdrive, cast
NulShock before it.

For advancing past level 3 for the first time you receive 10x Chocobo Feather.
Beat Ixion any time afterwards as many times as you want and you'll receive 8x
Power Sphere.

LEVEL 4 - SHIVA BATTLE

1. Boss' HP / HP Overkill; MP
20000 / 20000; 950

2. Boss' status info:
- Immune to every negative status, including Eject and Demi
- NS
- Immune to Poison
- Immune to Doom

3. Boss' stats info:
St, Df, Mg, Mf, Ag, Lu, Ev, Ac
23, 180,20, 180,21, 15, 0,  0

4. Boss' el. info; Sensor info; Scan info
Absorbs ice; Immune to Sensor; Immune to Scan

5. Boss' attacks:
a) 'Kick' - VS one chr - phd
b) Diamond Dust - IATT VS one/all chr/s - ice mgd
c) Heavenly Strike - VS one chr - phd + Delay effect
d) Blizzara - IATT VS one chr - ice mgd
e) Blizzaga - IATT VS one chr - ice mgd

6. Boss strategy:
You know, when you fight Shiva, she's a pretty smart girl (and that means both
meanings:)). Since you can't use Shiva for this battle, I'd recommend using
someone with good Def and HP - Bahamut. Prior battle teach him Haste, Shell,
Cura/ga, NulFrost and Protect.
As battle starts, cast Haste and Protect on Bahamut, Shell on *Shiva*. Then
keep hacking away at Shiva. For most of the fight she'll try to hurt Bahamut
with her 'kick' or casting Blizzara. Rarely she decides for Heavenly Strike. As
her HP gets low, she tends to use Blizzaga on her, but it won't be as
efficient, as you've put Shell on her. If Bahamut's HP gets low, don't forget
to heal him.

For advancing past level 4 for the first time you receive 60x Mega-Potion. Beat
Shiva any time afterwards as many times as you want and you'll receive 6x Star
Curtain.

LEVEL 5 - BAHAMUT BATTLE

1. Boss' HP / HP Overkill; MP
35000 / 35000; 1500

2. Boss' status info:
- Immune to every negative status, including Eject and Demi
- NS
- Immune to Poison
- Immune to Doom

3. Boss' stats info:
St, Df, Mg, Mf, Ag, Lu, Ev, Ac
31, 1,  38, 1,  20, 15, 0,  0

4. Boss' el. info; Sensor info; Scan info
NS; Immune to Sensor; Immune to Scan

5. Boss' attacks:
a) 'Swipe' - CATT VS one chr - phd
b) Mega Flare - STATT VS one/all chr/s - std
c) Countdown: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 - countdown turn to Mega Flare

6. Boss strategy:
Boring! This Bahamut is exactly the same as the one you fought in Purifico with
one exception: every time you attack Bahamut, he'll counter with 'swipe'. On
his normal turns he'll count down turns to Mega Flare.
Summon Shiva for this battle, use Haste and Protect on her, then keep
attacking. If Bahahut gets to the point where he can use Mega Flare, use
Shield. And that's all there is to it.

For advancing past level 5 for the first time you receive Flower Scepter *KEY
ITEM*. Beat Bahamut any time afterwards as many times as you want and you'll
receive 8x Mana Sphere.

LEVEL 6 - YOJIMBO BATTLE

1. Boss' HP / HP Overkill; MP
32000 / 32000; 1200

2. Boss' status info:
- Immune to every negative status, including Eject and Demi
- NS
- Immune to Poison
- Immune to Doom

3. Boss' stats info:
St, Df, Mg, Mf, Ag, Lu, Ev, Ac
34, 80, 35, 1,  32, 15, 0,  0

4. Boss' el. info; Sensor info; Scan info
NS; Immune to Sensor; Immune to Scan

5. Boss' attacks:
a) Daigoro - VS one chr - phd
b) Kozuka - VS one chr - phd
c) Wakizashi - VS one chr OR all chrs - phd
d) Zanmato - STATT VS one/all chr/s - std (?)

6. Boss strategy:
This also is boring, it's not even funny. If you have troubles seeing your
Yojimbo do Zanmato, here's the chance for you to see it, but Yojimbo requires
lots of turns before his Overdrive fills all the way up.
Shiva yet again is recommended. Once summoned, Haste and Protect on her, then
hacking away at Yojimbo. He'll fall sooner or later.

For advancing past level 6 for the first time you receive 8x Shadow Gem. Beat
Yojimbo any time afterwards as many times as you want and you'll receive 10x
Power Sphere.

LEVEL 7 - ANIMA BATTLE

1. Boss' HP / HP Overkill; MP
54000 / 54000; 3000

2. Boss' status info:
- Immune to every negative status, including Eject and Demi
- NS
- Immune to Poison
- Immune to Doom

3. Boss' stats info:
St, Df, Mg, Mf, Ag, Lu, Ev, Ac
38, 1,  60, 1,  15, 15, 0,  0

4. Boss' el. info; Sensor info; Scan info
NS; Immune to Sensor; Immune to Scan

5. Boss' attacks:
a) 'Stare' - VS one chr - phd
b) Oblivion - STATT VS one/all chr/s - 16 consecutive hits + Delay effect
c) Pain - NATT VS one chr - mgd + KO
d) Dispel - VS one chr - shatters most positive statuses
e) Demi - GRATT VS one/all chr/s - tears off 25% current HP

6. Boss strategy:
Last two fights are at least somewhat interesting. Besides lots of HP Anima
boasts high Str and Mag, but she lacks speed. So once again Shiva to the rescue
(I luv ya, my girl!). Since it is not necessary to beat Anima before you obtain
Magus Sisters, you can also use them for your aid.
Cos Anima knows Dispel, it is recommended you bestow Shiva with Haste only.
Every time Shiva gets dispeled, recast Haste at her. 'Stare' and Pain should be
nothing to worry about, along with Demi. As you attack Anima relentlessly, keep
an eye on both Shiva's HP and Anima's overdrive gauge. At least two turns
before Anima's gauge would get full, cease attacking. Heal Shiva first, then
use Shield. Oblivion will deal crappy damage, but it will take a while before
Shiva has another turn cos of enormous Delay effect.
After Oblivion proceed with using the regular strategy.

For advancing past level 7 for the first time you receive 60x Stamina Spring.
Beat Anima any time afterwards as many times as you want and you'll receive 10x
Mana Sphere.

6. Boss strategy:
Wide repertoire of spells, three enemies to deal with, decent AI... all of this
combined promises a challenging battle. And indeed it is. You might actually
have some problems beating this one. Let's see... for your side I recommend
Bahamut, cos his Impulse hits every target on the field.
As you summon him, cast Haste on him, but only that! Cindy knows Dispel, so
it's pointless to recast multiple beneficial spells, only to have them negated.
Use Impulse twice (meanwhile you'll get attacked of course, but just bear with
it), then normal attack on Mindy. This just eliminated enemy party's magician,
as well as danger of being Delta Attack-ed. After Mindy is eliminated, heal
Bahamut (cure spells!).
Now you should get rid of Sandy. But prior to that, cast Reflect on both Cindy
and Sandy - this will net you all the good spells Cindy will try to cast upon
them (Regen, Protect, Shell, Cura). Mighty Guard still gets thru Reflect, but
bear with it.
Once you get rid of Sandy, it's only Cindy remaining. She's not so hard, cos
for the most of the battle she'll be using support spells. Do take care near
end of battle (when Cindy is low on HP), as she can chuck Holy your way.
Magus Sisters are defeated, and all of Belgemine's aeons as well.

For advancing past level 8 for the first time you receive 40x Shining Gem. Beat
Sisters any time afterwards as many times as you want and you'll receive 12x
Power Sphere. If you choose to s... Belgemine any time after you defeat
Sisters, you'll receive Moon Sigil, final upgrade for Yuna's Nirvana. You won't
be able to fight Belgemine's aeons anymore... but who cares, really? Awards
you're receiving are pathetic.

# Magus Sisters stuff-to-do
This is the big one why we've come here. There's a sealed door behind
Belgemine. To unseal it, you need three things: Flower Scepter, Blossom Crown
and a bit of patience.
- to get Flower Scepter, you need to waste Belgemine's Bahamut
- to get Blossom Crown, you need to capture at least one of every fiend from Mt
Gagazet; then return to Monster Arena and manager will hand over B. Crown
- you must obtain Anima and Yojimbo
- once all of this is done, approach the sealed door, which will now unseal
- Magus Sisters are yours

VI - CAVERN OF THE S. F. ---> A088
Enemies: Tonberry, Ghost, Yowie, Magic Urn, Defender, Thorn, Valaha, Epaaj,
Coeurl, Malboro, Nidhogg, Dark Element, Imp, Mech Hunter, Yojimbo (BOSS)
Items: 1x Megalixir, 1x Lv.2 Key Sp., 1x Fortune Sp., 2x Mega-Potion, 1x MP
Sphere, 2x X-Potion
Weapons: Flexible Arm
Key Items: Primer XXV
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Available once you dismantle Defender X, you can complete this dungeon to nail
Yojimbo, another one of three optional Aeons you can find during the game. Oh
yeah, you'll also need about 300 grans.
So, once Defender X is defeated, don't go ahead, but instead take a right by
following the path down. Here there will be a save sphere and a bit more left
entrance to Cavern of S. F.
The dungeon itself is pretty straightforward, with no big turns, but in here
there are a few nice enemies to deal with. If you encounter Tonberries, put
them to sleep and then unload on them. Flee from Magic Pots battles - trying to
guess what eye is right *is* useless. Ghosts drop armor with No Encounters
ability, if you're lucky.
Enter the dungeon. You'll arrive in a big room (teleport pad in here is
inactive yet), with path continuing on the right (according to mini-map).
Follow the path (another path will branch to the right, leading to chest with
1x Megalixir). Return on the path and enter second big room. You'll see a
scene. Further ahead will be next tunnel, with paths branching off forward,
right and left. Forward one is an obvious dead end, right one leads to chest
with Lv.2 Key Sp. Take left path to arrive an four-cross intersection. Forward
path takes you to chest with 1x Fortune Sp., right one is dead end... left path
again the right one? Yep. Yet *another* four-cross intersection. This time left
one is dead end (here nail Al Bhed Primer XXV *KEY ITEM*), forward you'll see
chest with 2x Mega-Potion, and right one leads to save sphere. Save your game,
for there is boss ahead.

3. Monster's MP: 2000
4. AP gained when monster is defeated: N/A
5. Items stolen: Nothing to steal
6. Items dropped: N/A

b) Kozuka - VS one chr - phd
c) Zanmato - VS all chrs - deals 9999 damage regardless of protection

18. Monster strategy:
Quite easy. Use Candle of Life on it, defend/heal for five Yojimbo's turns and
then he's gone.

Yawn. So much trouble yet I get nothing. I want a refund. Seriously, though,
you need at least 300000 Gil as well. Once you 'talk' to Yojimbo, he'll offer
three choices. Pick whichever you want, and then pay him 300000 gil you brought
along. Yojimbo is yours. If at any time you pay him triple amount of his asking
price, he'll throw in 2x Teleport Sphere. When teleported back, teleport to
left room and nab chest for Flexible Arm. Right room has 1x MP Sphere and 2x X-
Potion. Teleport back and then return to entrance.

VII - AIRSHIP PASSWORDS AND COORDINATES
---------------------------------------

# PASSWORDS ---> A014

WARNING: A contributor was playing the Italian version of the game, and since
the passwords GODHAND and VICTORIOUS weren't working, he must've figured out
the passwords the hard way. It was GOD HAND and VICTORIAS, so if you got a non-
english version, you might need to find the passwords on the game, unless you
have an FAQ for your language.

There's three passwords you can input under the Password option when on your
airship. These passwords are as follows (case sensitive):

Password 1: GODHAND
Opens up Mushroom Rock destination in NavMap, that will lead you to Rikku's
best weapon Godhand. You'll need Celestial Mirror in order to open the chest.
Picture support:
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/godhanddestiny.jpg
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/godhanddestination.jpg

How can you work it out?
On the Mi'ihen highroad ruins there is a sphere which tells you about the great
thorn in the calm lands, visit here, and follow the directions it gives you.
You'll have to do quite some walking, but eventually you will come to the
password.

Password 2: VICTORIOUS
Opens up Besaid Ruins 1 destination in NavMap, that will lead you to armor
Victorious (Lightningproof, Fireproof, Iceproof, 1 FS). Pretty useless.
Picture support:
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/victoriousdestiny.jpg
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/victoriousdestination.jpg

How can you work it out?
The sphere in Besaid tells you how it's done. Just collect the letters from
Kilika forest, and the ruins in Bikanel island, and then write them out, small
letters first, then capitals for the last word. You take one letter from
Kilika, then one from Bikanel etc, and you end up with 'the password is
VICTORIOUS' (that is in the English version of the game anyway).

Password 3: MURASAME
Opens up Besaid Ruins 2 destination in NavMap, that will lead you to Auron's
weapon Murasame (Piercing, One MP Cost, 2 FS).
Picture support:
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/murasamedestiny.jpg
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/murasamedestination.jpg

How can you work it out?
To find the password, go to the Baaj Temple ruins and go outside, examine the
sphere on the pillars to the right of this area, it will mention where the
password can be found, and you don't have to be a brain surgeon to work it out.

VIII - O. RUINS ---> A405
Enemies: Floating Death, Master Coeurl, Zaurus, treasure chest (latter may turn
into Mimic), Great Malboro, Wraith, Master Tonberry, Defender Z, Varuna,
Adamantoise, Spirit, Halma, Black Element, Puroboros, Machea, Demonolith,
Gemini (there're two kinds)
Items: 1x Teleport Sphere, 1x Magic Sphere, 1x Friend Sphere
Weapons: None
Key Items: Primer XXVI
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Supposedly hardest dungeon in the game. Yeah right.:) Before you venture in the
deepest depths of ruins, you *need* one ability. First Strike. Without it
you're doomed before you even begin the descent. Why? Great Malboros found in
O. Ruins will *always* ambush you, and they use Bad Breath on first turn. So
unless you have Ribbon in your armor, your chrs will strike each other down.
Now you can either use Flee with whoever has that command (and of course you
equipped him/her with First Strike as well) or use Delay Buster against it,
delaying its turn and then proceeding hacking away at it.
On FFX message board over at Gamefaqs I've noticed that there's a subquest
involving opening chests found in O. Ruins in certain order. At the end you'll
receive 99x Warp Sphere. Want a friendly piece of advice? Don't bother with it.
There are other ways to receive Warp Spheres or to find easier alternatives for
it.
Your ultimate goal in this dungeon are two wanna-be-hard bosses. I missed them
in FF9, but they make a return in this FF. Yap, it's our Ultima Weapon and
Omega Weapon, both of which have been beefed up a bit. Okay, Omega has been
beefed a lot.
Let us start by saving at the save point. This is the only one in whole
dungeon, so make use of it while you're here. Mini-map will be useless, at
least until you explore the whole dungeon. So let's start searching around. Up
ahead you'll see a big crossroads. Forward path leads to a dead end. Right path
will take you to a small round-shaped room with two chests. Open them...
chances are you'll fight some monsters (Zaurus and possibly Mimic). This is a
part of treasure hunting minigame I mentioned above. If you happen to open a
treasure with monsters, you have to win that battle. You can't flee and for
some strange reason Copycat command cannot be selected. There's a left turn
right before this round room, but it leads to a forward path I mentioned
before. So you need to go left on the big crossroads. You'll end up in another
round room with three chests. Hm, no path forward? Not true!
Just before this room there is path that leads to the right. Take it. At next
intersection you will have a chance of going left or right. Left path takes you
to another room with three chests. Take the right path. You'll see a glyph on
the wall. Tocuh it, but nothing will happen. You have to power it up first.
Across this glyph is a tiny slope, which leads to another chest, but it is
currently off limits. Continue past the glyph. You'll end up in X-marks-the-
spot room with four chests. In the back you'll see two blue lights. Near the
base of left one is Vol. XXVI *KEY ITEM*, which completes your collection of
Primers... finally, I might add.
Going left or right will take you around for a spin. Go left first, and then
take another left to reach a room with a glyph stone at the end. Touch this
glyph and glyph you saw before is now operational. Return to it, touch it, and
the missing part of tiny slope behind you will conveniently rise from the
bowels... okay, from below. Go up the path, and have two more desserts served.
I can already tell that reward for your troubles is a crappy one: 1x Teleport
Sphere. Yay us... Return to X room, and this time, go right. You'll reach a
square shaped stone in the floor. Step on it. Look, a green square will appear
in minimap. Approach it...

c) Break - VS one chr - inflicts Petrify
d) Shimmering Rain - STATT VS all chrs - std - cannot be halved in any way

f) Sleep - VS one chr - inflicts Sleep (inflicted for three chr's turns)
g) Core Energy - NATT VS one chr - mgd
h) Confuse - VS one chr - inflicts Confusion

18. Monster strategy:
From the look of Ultima's attacks you'd think that he'll be a strong boss. But
noooo... he has a set pattern of moves. And I'm here to disclose it in
following strategy. Revealed first will be the pattern of how exactly does
Ultima operate from commencing battle.
1st turn - 'Swipe'
2nd turn - Silence OR Break
3rd turn - Core Energy
4th turn - Holy OR Sleep OR Confusion
5th turn - 'Swipe'
6th turn - Shimmering Rain
Then pattern repeats itself. 'Swipe' deals 3200 damage, Core Energy 4000, Holy
8000 - these are attacks that hit one chr. Shimmering Rain deals 2500 damage to
all.
Let's talk about actual strategy for this boss-wannabe. As battle starts, use
Dark Buster (Smoke Bomb) and Silence Buster (Silence Grenade) against Ultima.
Woohoo, suck on this, Ultima. Try to nail me now. You're safe until Ultima's
3rd turn, where he uses Core Energy. By Shelling you'll take measly 2000
damage. One Curaga and we're back in fighting shape. Re-Dark and re-Silence
Ultima. You're again safe until 6th turn, where he will use Shimmering Rain.
Note that damage done by this attack is of special type damage, falling in the
category of attacks which cannot be halved in any way. Remember to heal up
after Shimmering Rain is used.
For players deciding to toy around with Ultima I'm suggesting Reflecting your
chrs. Then Ultima will successfully Silence itself, hehe. And how about seeing
holy stars?
I'll leave it up to you to choose necessary course of action to take down this
wussie. The quickest way to 'defeat' Ultima is by Bribing it for 1 million gil,
in which case you'll get a bunch of Pendulums, enough for few Master Thief
armors.

Once Ultima is defeated, you can now use the teleport to be transported to
other part of O. Ruins. If you go left first, you can get a goodie from chest
found here - Friend Sphere. Note that in each stone circle there'll be a fight.
You can flee from those anyway. Once you swerve right as long as you can... 'It
seems we rate his personal attention now.'

d) Shimmering Rain - STATT VS all chrs - std - cannot be halved in any way
e) Nova - STATT VS all chrs - std
f) Demi - NATT VS all chrs - tears off 25% of current HP
g) Core Energy - NATT VS one chr - mgd
h) Ultima - NATT VS all chrs - mgd

18. Monster strategy:
Now this guy is THE tough optional boss you're looking for. Let's talk first
about damage he can do to you. 'Swipe' strikes for about 4000, Core Energy for
6000 - this is for single target. Shimmering Rain does 3200 to all, and Nova
does whopping 8000 damage to all chrs. Beware of Ultima - strikes for about
5000 to all.
Unfortunately you can't afflict him with any status, so you'll have to duke it
out close and personal. And his attacks do not follow a set attack pattern.
For starters cast Hastega, Protect and lastly Shell. In your armor you should
have melted Stoneproof and Confuseproof. This takes care of Omega's Confuse and
Break. Protect will help against 'Swipe', Shell against Demi and Ultima. Nova
and Shimmering Rain can't be halved damage-wise, so you'll have to bear it.
Nova is Omega's strongest attack - it seems to me that it is used every 10th
turn Omega got since last Nova it threw at you. BTW, remember to call in
Kimahri to use Lancet on Omega to learn Nova (if you miss the chance, you can
still learn Nova from Nemesis).
Rely only on your chrs and their brute strength. If you'll be summoning, use
your Aeons to their fullest. With that said, summon them in Overdrive and let
it rip.

19. Special info: Kimahri can learn Nova.

Once Omega is defeated as well, you'll be transported to the entrance of O.
Ruins. Talk about instant wish... chest? What about it? Oh, the one in Omega
room? Magic Sphere, if you must absolutely get it.

IX - LIGHTNING DODGER ---> A303
---------------------

This sidequest is available once you regain control of the airship. Return to
Thunder Plains. You'll need a lot of patience and nerves of steel for this
mini-game.
Main quest of this so-called mini game is to obtain Venus Sigil for Lulu's
Onion Knight. Once you've saved your game, equip somebody with No Encounters
ability. I assure you don't want to be bothered by random battles while
avoiding those sand-blasted grease monkeys... wait, that's wrong phrase...
annoying thunders. The moment you see a flash, press X immediately to have
Tidus jump out of the way. You *mustn't* seek shelter under the rods, save or
leave the screen - doing so will reset the counter! You also mustn't mash X
button rapidly, as you'll get hit. After you've dodged 200 bolts, return to
front of Rin's agency, open the chest and Venus Sigil is yours. There's also a
bit of crappy rewards for you to obtain, if you dodge following amounts of
bolts:
5 bolts - 2x X-Potion
10 bolts - 2x Mega-Potion
20 bolts - 2x MP Sphere (not enough for one Holy s...)
50 bolts - 3x Strength Sphere (mildly useful)
100 bolts - 3x HP Sphere (oooh, 900 HP increase... sarcastic yay)
150 bolts - 4x Megalixir (we should've gotten some Master Spheres instead)
200 bolts - Venus Sigil

Guess what else? You can receive prizes for letting bolts actually strike you.
30 bolt hits - 1x Ether
80 bolt hits - 1x Elixir

---------------------------
X - VILLAGE OF THE CACTUARS ---> A080
---------------------------

Using spheres to control the sands, the Cactuars defend their village. They are
the Gatekeepers. Present all 10 of the spheres they bear to the stone altar,
and the way to the village will open.

This sidequest is available once you regain control of the airship. Return to
Bikanel Island. Remember part of desert with sandstorms and a big cactuar stone
in front of it? Now you can start the sidequest involving those two.

A picture showing the location of the stone available at following URL:
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/quest_start.jpg

Way of the Gatekeepers I
- It may look like fun and games, but the Gatekeepers are a proud race of
warriors.
- While they dislike combat, they will turn and face any enemy that takes their
back.

Way of the Gatekeepers II
- Should you fail to sneak up on them they will realise they have over-
estimated their enemy and depart in disgust.

Way of the Gatekeepers III
- Sneak up on the cactuars when their backs are turned to confront them. It's
better that way, believe me.

Spheres
- Fail to catch the gatekeeper unaware, and you'll obtain the Sphere del
Perdedor!
- Best the gatekeeper and obtain his personalised sphere!
- Collect lots of spheres to receive an award at the village (note: the awards
suck IMO, so don't bother again if you fail).

'Song of the Gatekeeper'
10 little gatekeepers play in the sand.
Tomay's gone. Gone to fetch the water.
Be back soon.

This is your clue to whereabouts of first Cactuar. Only water you've seen
around here is at the Oasis. So that's where we're going. BTW, No Encounters
ability will help immensely to avoid random battles. What's that green thing in
the shadows to the right? Time to catch Tomay: 10 seconds.

A picture showing Tomay's location available at following URL:
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/tomay.jpg

If you manage to sneak up on Tomay, you will have to fight him as well.:)
Defeat him to receive Tomay's sphere. If you fail to sneak up on him, you get
Sphere del Perdedor. You don't have to beat the Cactuar once in battle with
him. You can escape and you will still get personalised sphere. You must not
lose to the Cactuar with all three chrs getting KO-ed, or you'll get Game Over.
Whatever the outcome, return to stone altar and insert the sphere you got.

'Song of the Gatekeeper'
9 little gatekeepers play in the sand.
Rovivea's gone walkabout.
Be back soon.

What a dumb clue. Rovivea can be found running around in east Sanubia desert in
westernmost dead end. Time to catch Rovivea: 13 seconds. Get the sphere and put
it in the altar.

Little Chava likes big numbers.
Be back soon.

This one's close. In this part of desert find the sign with '20% off' stuff on
it and examine it. Time to catch Chava: 13 seconds. Get the sphere and put it
in the altar.

Pretty obvious. Return to Central Sanubia desert and go in the part of it where
there are lots of ruins. Time to catch those two: 13 seconds. Get the sphere
and put it in the altar.

Examine save sphere here and... Time to catch Vachella: 14 seconds. Get the
sphere and put it in the altar.

O, Robeya's stuck inside.
Be back soon.

Vague clue again, grrr. Go to central desert and locate westernmost treasure
chest. I thought we opened it already? Time to catch Robeya: 14 seconds. Hmm,
more chests? If you manage, you can grab 2x Shadow Gem, 1x Shining Gem, 1x
Blessed Gem. Get the sphere and put it in the altar.

'Song of the Gatekeeper'
3 little gatekeepers play in the sand.
A fiery inscription--The lord of the hole is gone. Isrra thinks.
Be back soon.

This has to do with sandholes in which you fought Sandragoras before. *Leave*
this screen and come back. Isrra can now be found in one of the holes. Time to
catch Isrra: 15 seconds. Lately I've discovered something neat. As you enter
the screen where you have 15 seconds to capture Isrra, notice the sandhole to
the left of your position. Also notice the minimap in upper left corner?
Minimap ain't available during any other capture-the-Cactuar screens. Anyway,
enter the sandhole and keep pushing down. You will travel all the way to the
bottom of the screen thru an invisible passageway below the sand. You'll pop
out in a sandhole a bit to the left of Isrra. As you'll see, you're very close
to him. So just get near him and he's yours to fight. Get the sphere and put it
in the altar.

'Song of the Gatekeeper'
2 little gatekeepers play in the sand.
Much-curious Elio has left on a journey.
Be back soon.

Why do they have to go all the way to the Oasis?:) Go there and you will see
USS Enterprise 'event'. Hey! Go to your airship and head for the place where
you fought Evrae for first time. Time to catch Elio: 11 seconds. Get the sphere
and put it in the altar.

Depending on how many Cactuar spheres you got, right chest will have following
awards: for 1-2 spheres you get 1x Potion, for up to 5 spheres 1x Elixir, for
up to 7 spheres 1x Megalixir, for up to 9 spheres 1x Friend Sphere. Major
letdown, yet again. Pick the grand prize, Mercury Sigil in the other chest
found here.

XI - MUSIC & MOVIE SPHERES ---> A380 & A371
--------------------------

You know the theatre in Luca? Well, in this place you can buy Music and Movie
Spheres. 1 Music Sphere costs 2 grans, while 1 Movie Sphere costs 5 grans. The
longer you progress in the game, more Music and/or Movie Spheres will be
available. There is a grand total of 71 Music and 50 Movie Spheres available at
the end of game. Once you purchase first 68 Music Spheres, talk to the chap
that sells them. He'll offer you to buy last three Music Spheres, thus
completing your collection.
The very last movie/s, ie ones you see after you finish the game by defeating
last boss, cannot be bought no way whatsoever.

------------------------------------------
XII - RETURNING TO TEMPLE'S FAYTH CHAMBERS
------------------------------------------

I bet that some of you tried to return to the temples they've visited so far,
but you couldn't enter cos path would be blocked by some bozos? Here's what you
must do: After certain event Highbridge destination will become available on
NavMap. You'll know when you see it. Go there, proceed to the end of
'driveway' and see the event that'll follow.
Now you will no longer be stopped from entering the temples. You can revisit
Besaid temple (Dark Valefor needs to be feathered first), Kilika temple, Djose
temple, Macalania temple (Dark Shiva needs to be put on ice first), Cavern of
S. F. (room where you got money eating machine), Baaj temple and Remiem temple.
Most of those revisited will let you hear a part of the story and you'll be
awarded some spheres most of the time.

XIV - AP GAINING TRICK ---> A840, A840A
----------------------

There are cases when your chrs need to gain a lot of AP to quickly cross lot of
Sphere Grid. This trick is (a common knowledge on FFX gameplay board) just what
you need, and it finally has a place in this guide as well. *crowd cheers*
Let's see just what do you require for this wonderful AP gaining machina. I'll
make it be as easy as possible.

You'll need to capture at least one of every capturable fiend in Cavern of S.
F. so that you unlock Don Tonberry in Monster Arena, make sure your chrs know
Comrade overdrive mode, and a few empty three-slotted weapons.

What I'll list first is with what weapon abilities you can work around with,
slowly advancing to better ones until I'll finish at the best combination
possible. The trick itself will be listed at the end.

At very beginning I'll need you to check something. If you have already
captured Tonberry or Master Tonberry, or have Don Tonberry unlocked, give them
a shot, but do not try to kill them yet! This fight is just a test to see which
three of your chrs have killed the most enemies. Have each chr do something
simple to Tonberry or whatever Tonberry you're fighting, and this Tonberry will
counter with Karma. Take note which three chrs took the highest damage from
Karma, for these three chrs are the ones you should be using (make sure at
least one knows Flee).

A - STRIKE ONE
If you're just starting with this trick, you'll need just one ability, which is
Overdrive->AP. For one you'll need 10x Door to Tomorrow. There are several ways
you can obtain Doors to Tomorrow, or the weapon with ability itself.
- unlock six area creations, which will unlock Catastrophe; for this effort
you'll be awarded 99x Door to Tomorrow from arena manager
- if Ultima Weapon hasn't been defeated yet, steal from it; usual steal is 10x,
and rare 20x Door to Tomorrow
- once Bomb King is unlocked (by capturing 5 Bombs, Grenades and Puroboroses)
you can defeat him for 1x Door to Tomorrow (drops 2x for an Overkill)
- you can Bribe Mech Leader for few Doors to Tomorrow
- only Ultima Buster drops weapons with Overdrive->AP ability already on it,
but chances are you haven't unlocked him yet or he's too powerful for you to
defeat

B - STRIKE TWO
So you've gained access to Overdrive->AP weapon? Cool. But wouldn't it be
cooler if you'd gain double amount of AP? That's just what Double AP ability is
for. For Double AP you need 20x Megalixir.
- Bribe Xiphos for all Megalixirs you'll need

C - STRIKE THREE
What's better than Double AP? Triple AP of course. Uhhh, but you need 50x Wings
to Discovery for it. True, but what if I tell you how you can get a weapon with
Triple AP already on it? Interested? Read on.:)
Enemies that drop Triple AP weapons are One-Eye, Ultima Buster, Th'uban and
Neslug. Latter three can be way out of your league, but One-Eye can be
manageable. To unlock One-Eye you need to capture at least 4 of each Floating
Eye, Buer, Evil Eye, Ahriman, Floating Death.
For One-Eye strategy look below in Monster Arena section, but know that when
you defeat him you'll most often get three-sloted Triple AP weapons with two
slots with nothing in it.

D - STRIKE FOUR
So, Overdrive->AP and Triple AP combo is yours. There is one more stuff that
can be added onto that combo, making it complete. The lowest alternative of
last bunch is SOS Overdrive. For one you need 20x Gambler's Spirit. It can be
obtained in bunch of ways.
- Bribe Floating Death
- unlock Th'uban to receive 99x Gambler's Spirit
- defeat Ornitholestes for 2x Gambler's Spirit (4x for Overkill)
- Steal Gambler's Spirit in amounts of 30 from Omega Weapon
- finally, all Original Creations but Nemesis offer Gambler's Spirit as common
stuff to be stolen
- Xiphos, Machea, Behemoth and Behemoth King may drop weapons with SOS
Overdrive ability already on it

E - STRIKE FIVE
Better choice from SOS Overdrive is Double Overdrive. For one you need 30x
Underdog's Secret. You can't get them so easily.
- receive 99x Underdog's Secret from Rin when you speak to him on airship, but
only if you possess all 26 Al Bhed Primers in your inventory
- kill Th'uban for 1x Underdog's Secret (2x for Overkill)
- Varuna, Ornitholestes and Ultima Weapon may drop Double Overdrive weapons
I don't recommend Double Overdrive. Too much of a hassle trying to collect
Underdog's Secrets.

F - STRIKE SIX
Ultimate combo you can wish for is Overdrive->AP, Triple AP and Triple
Overdrive. You need 30x Winning Formula for one Triple Overdrive.
- get 99x Winning Formula from arena manager once you unlock Neslug (unlock all
area creations)
- defeat Ultima Buster for 1x Winning Formula (2x for Overkill)
- Bribe Sand Worm
- defeat Th'uban, Earth Eater, Ultima Buster or Omega Weapon and you just may
be one of the lucky winners with Triple Overdrive weapon on it

G - STRIKE SEVEN
Personally I'm more than satisfied with AP gaining weapon that has following
abilities - Overdrive->AP, Triple AP, SOS Overdrive.
In order to quickly get it, do the following: fight One-Eye for Triple AP
weapon with two free slots left. Then go and Bribe Mech Leader for Doors to
Tomorrow (to get Overdrive->AP). And finally Bribe Floating Death for Gambler's
Spirits (to get SOS Overdrive).
If you have other preferred weapon, feel free to choose your own favorite. I
have provided you with as much info as I could so that you can find the
ingredients for abilities with ease.

H - STRIKE EIGHT
Whaaat? Armor ability? Yep. To fully utilize this AP gaining, you'll need to
spend as much turns attacking Don Tonberry as you can. Therefore you need Auto-
Phoenix. To get one you need 20x Mega Phoenix. Let's see...
- unlock Pteryx for 99x Mega Phoenix
- Bribe Ghost for Mega Phoenixes
- Greater Sphere may drop an armor with Auto-Phoenix

I - STRIKE NINE
Buy 99x Phoenix Down. Trust me, you'll need them.

H - FINAL STRIKE
Now the magic itself. Did you unlock Don Tonberry yet? If not, go to Cavern of
S. F. and capture one of every fiend in there. This is fixed. Comrade Overdrive
mode you must've obtained already, so no worries here (remember to switch to it
before battle!). And you also have AP gaining weaponry. Now put three chrs you
selected before (I told you what test to undertake... ahh, to heck with it - it
doesn't matter which three you choose), and equip them with their AP gaining
weapons and Auto-Phoenix armors. Pay the cash to fight the Don and let the AP
hunt begin.
Don will stand there, smoking his pipe. 'So, you've finally come for my AP? I
ain't giving them away so easily. Not without a proper fight!!!' Any chr that
gets a turn, attack the Don. Don counters with Karma. Whatever damage you just
received, was converted in AP for other two chrs. Sweet, eh? Now Auto-Phoenix
will kick in, reviving fallen chr, leaving it at critical HP (make place for
SOS Overdrive). Repeat the process until Don gets close enough (requires four
turns), at which point he'll switch to stabbing one chr (make sure you
occassionally check how many Phoenix Downs you have left). He can't... no,
shouldn't be faster than you. His Agi is 37, and I'm sure you have at least
twice of that Agi, if not even thrice. Keep letting him kill you, until you
almost run out of Phoenix Downs. Now it's a good time to escape using Flee
command. If noone knows it or Tidus isn't part of the party, switch him in and
have him execute Flee.
Once the next screen pops up, your jaw will drop at the insane amounts of AP
you have just received. SLVL number will also rise up to 99 for sure.

J - WHAT NOW?
Use SLVL to move quickly across the grid, of course.

Reader Hugh has sent me an interesting e-mail:
... While the credits were rolling, I started reading all the side-quests and
various things-to-do. The AP trick really caught my eye... because I traversed
the sphere and maxed out my characters without having to get very high in SLV.
Right before fighting the final boss I ran around getting my butt kicked, but
winning, against the really hard random fiends collecting 99 teleport spheres
at a time. The stuff you can win from those guys makes the game very simple.
Then I teleported back to the ship to enjoy my god-like status. Being able to
jump around the sphere one at a time means you can level up guys you are not
even fighting with. I got so hooked on this process, by the time I finally
fought the last battles, it was very anti-climatic... everyone deals 9999 in
damage and all agility is over 100...  Just thought you might want to know
about this process, a lot easier than even collecting the things needed for the
AP trick...

Final note: This AP gaining will serve its purpose best when combined with stat
maxing guide, also found in this guide.

-------------------------------
XV - OMEGA RUINS TREASURES HUNT ---> A847
-------------------------------

The contents of successfully opening the chests will be:
1) 1x Lv.4 Sphere
2) Defending Bracer (2 slots) Silenceproof, Darkproof
3) Turnover (Magic Counter, Counter-Attack)

12) 99x WARP SPHERE!

----------------------------
XV - SEAGULLS COUNTING GAME
----------------------------

There's a person on uppermost deck of S.S.Winno. The soonest you can do this is
after Djose temple trials, I believe. Talk to him and he'll ask you to count
the seagulls around the ship. Since you're reading this, you already know the
answer. It's 11 seagulls. You'll receive Ace Wizard for Wakka (Mag+3%, Mag+5%,
Mag+10%, Mag+20%).

---------------------------
XVI - CLASKO'S WAY OF LIFE
---------------------------

In one of many encounters with Clasko talk to him just before fighting Crawler
at Macalania lake. At his question of what does the future hold, answer that
he's better suited as chocobo breeder. Later in the game when you have access
to the airship, return to S.S. Liki and he'll give you 1x Friend Sphere as sign
of gratitude.

VIII) ABOUT MONSTER ARENA ---> A368
=============================================================================
=============================================================================

Largest and most rewarding sidequest in the world of FFX. Available once you
gain access to Calm Lands, but advised to continue completing it later in the
game when you have control of the airship.

Q1 - Where is the Monster Arena?
A1 - Monster Arena is located in Calm Lands, more specifically in eastern part.

Q2 - Okay, I've found it, now what?
A2 - Talk to the old geezer. Apparently all of his monsters have escaped. And
it's *your* job to recapture them all.

Q3 - Capture them? How do I do that?
A3 - Talk to old geezer again. He sells just the weapons you need - with
Capture ability.

Q4 - Come again?
A4 - Further explanation necessary, I see. Okay. Let's make an actual example.
Buy Capture weapons for all seven characters. Now fly with airship over to
Besaid island. Equip Auron with Beastmaster (this is how his weapon is called)
and leave the other two front-line members with whatever they have for a
weapon. Fall into a battle with let's say Dingo and Condor.
Have Auron slice down Dingo. See? 'Dingo captured!' This means you successfully
captured a Dingo and he now counts toward Monster arena's total.
You *must kill* an enemy with a weapon with Capture ability on it. You can use
Skills, but you cannot use Overdrives.

Q5 - I've been capturing Dingos for a while and now I get this message 'Dingo
limit reached!'. What's up with that?
A5 - This means that you've reached that monster's limit. More specifically,
you can capture 10 of each capturable monster. Any additional monster will not
be added to the total number.

Q6 - 'Capturable' monster? Aren't they all?
A6 - No. Machine enemies, human enemies and some one-time-meet-me-only enemies
cannot be captured. List of all capturable monsters will appear below. And now
I've also provided pictures help that will show you what to find where.

Q7 - So far I see nothing of interest for doing this quest... what's in it for
me?
A7 - Let me nail you a few reasons why you should bother...
Reason 1: You get a bunch of hard-to-obtain-otherwise items.
Reason 2: Regular monsters are not exactly challenging, are they? Well, by
capturing them you may unlock special monster arena creations, which are yours
to battle for a small fee.
Reason 3: These bosses when fought and defeated yield a bunch of powerful
weapons with great abilities already on them, thus saving you a waste of your
hard earned items.
Reason 4: Hardest boss in the game can be found here (if I don't count Dark
Aeons).
Reason 5: C'mon, I know you want that Mark of Conquest...

Q8 - I'm having trouble encountering *insert monster*. Where can I find it?
A8 - For some of more elusive chaps I'll provide few tips. If that still
doesn't help, save your game, then reset your PS2. Reload your last save - with
this you've just jumbled monster encounter rate... hopefully now you'll fight
particular monster more often.:)

Q9 - OK, you've convinced me! Lemme at them.
A9 - Sure, go right ahead. Capturing the regulars ain't hard, what will be hard
will be monsters created once you capture enough stuff.:)

Questions have been answered, we now return to program.

EVERYTHING ABOUT MONSTER ARENA
******************************

# BASIC BASICS ON MONSTER ARENA

Once you talk to old geezer, he will present you with five choices:

- Chat
This is useless. At most times he'll tell you about what kind of monsters he
still needs to complete a monster cre(a)ti(o)n of his own.

- Fight monsters
This is the option you'll use the most. Screen that will follow is explained
below.

- Buy weapons
You'll only want to use this once... in order to buy Capture weapons for your
characters.

- Buy items
Another most used option. You'll return here often to buy Clear Spheres, which
will be available once you unlock Ultima Buster.

- Exit
What the name says.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# FIGHT-ME-PLEASE-OH-PRETTY-PLEASE SCREEN

Yap, this screen is where you will spend most of the time, pondering on which
enemy to spend your hard earned gil. The screen is divided into 16 entries, 13
of which are representing world areas, and 3 of which are reserved for special
monsters awaiting your ass-kicking.

From top left to bottom right areas go as follows:
A01 - Besaid
A02 - Kilika
A03 - Mi'ihen Highroad
A04 - Mushroom Rock Road
A05 - Djose Road
A06 - Thunder Plains
A07 - Macalania
A08 - Bikanel
A09 - Calm Lands
A10 - Sunken Cave (or Cavern of the S. F.)
A11 - Mt. Gagazet
A12 - I. Sin
A13 - O. Dungeon
A14 - Area Conquest
A15 - Species Conquest
A16 - Original

Note: Picture available at following URL:
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/monster_areas.jpg

Entries from A01 to A13 fill up as you capture fiends in particular area. Entry
A14 will fill up with monsters to fight once you've captured at least one of
each monster in specific area (example: Chimerageist will be unlocked once you
capture at least one of every monster in Calm Lands). Entry A15 will fill up
once you've captured a minimum amount of each fiend type (example: Pteryx will
be unlocked once you've captured few Condors, Simurghs and Alcyones). Entry A16
will fill up once you meet few special requirements. Do not worry, everything
will be explained in detail.

first visit Monster Arena, manager (that's old geezer, by the way) will want
you to first purify Calm Lands by capturing at least one of each monster found
in Calm Lands... once you do that, Chimerageist will be unlocked in Area

# GOT THEM ALL! NOW WHAT?

What is left is the big goal. Trash all of the monsters that manager created,
receive Mark of Conquest, up your statistics, receive best armors (that is,
make them) and then just have fun in the process.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# AREN'T YOU FORGETTING SOMETHING?

What? OH YEAH! Of course if feels right to provide you with few general advices
on engaging these guys.

--> Get celestial weapons for the guys you'll be using. Easiest celestial
weapons to be collected and fully powered up are Rikku's, Auron's and Yuna's.
Also Tidus' isn't hard, but you have two problems - if you forgot to pick up
Sun Crest, you have to trample Dark Bahamut, and for Sigil you have to win a
small Chocobo race.

--> Lots of preparations, some of which include:
# An armor consisting of Auto-Potion, Auto-Haste, Auto-Protect, Auto-Phoenix.
Instead of Auto-Potion you can have whatever you wish, but last three are
crucial. Don't leave your home without them.
# Another armor consisting of Deathproof, Confuseproof, Sleepproof and Auto-
Med. This will help you out stand longer against guys who use status attacks.
# And another armor with Berserkproof, Confuseproof, Sleepproof and Stoneproof.
This is armor created specifically for two guys you'll be fighting.
# A weapon consisting of Break Damage Limit, Triple Overdrive, Counter-attack,
Magic Counter. Even better choice is Celestial weapon.
# Your HP should be at 9999.
# Learn just about every ability there is on Sphere Grid, most needed are Quick
Hit, Auto-Life, Holy, Flare, Ultima.
# Tidus should have Blitz Ace and Wakka his Attack Reels. I didn't bother with
Wakka's Attack Reels, tho'... too much bad blitz memories...

--> Area creations aren't so fun to deal with, cos they don't drop useful
items. Species creations, however are entirely different story.

--> I could suggest a line-up in order to fight these guys, but that's a hard
option. What'll I do instead is provide as much feedback as possible on monster
bosses so that you may choose for yourself which of them sounds easy enough for
you to try your best on.

--> For strategies for these guys I'll make a few changes for their info: Gil
earned, scan and sensor infos got lost cos you can't view them or you can't
earn them. In strategy part you'll find recommended armor to be used and
recommended weapon to be used. Then the strategy for boss itself follows.

# IN-DEPTH INFO AND STRATEGIES FOR MONSTER CRETINS!

***********************
Part A - Area Creations
***********************

---> STRATOAVIS <--- ---> A571

1. Name: Stratoavis
2. Monster's HP: 320000/10000
3. Monster's MP: 115
4. AP gained when monster is defeated: 8000/8000
5. Items stolen: 3x Smoke Bomb/2x Stamina Spring
6. Items dropped: 2x/4x Amulet; 1x/2x Dark Matter
7. Monster's status info:
- Immune: Berserk, Confusion, Darkness, Death, Delay skills, Demi, Eject,
Petrify, Poison, Provoke, Silence, Sleep, Slow, Threaten, Zombie
- susceptible: 90% Armor Break, 90% Magic Break, 90% Mental Break, 90% Power
Break, 90% Slow
- 200 turns for Doom
8. Monster's stats info:
St, Df, Mg, Mf, Ag, Lu, Ev, Ac
73, 41, 32, 82, 32, 15, 5,  100
9. Monster's el. info: NS
10. Monster's equip. dropped info: 2-4 slots, 1-3 abilities already present,
99% probability of equipment piece being dropped
11. Weapon abilities: Str+5%, Str+10%, Str+20%
12. Armor abilities: HP+10%, HP+20%, HP+30%
13. Monster's attacks:
a) 'Beak bash' - VS one chr - phd
b) Charging - signifies charge turn for Paean of the Heavens
c) Paean of the Heavens - GRATTP VS all chrs - tears off 93,5% MAX HP - phd +
Darkness and delays next turn of all chrs - used every fourth turn
d) 'Land' - once you knock off 66% of its HP, Stratoavis will have to land -
Charging and Paean of the Heavens are no longer used

14. Monster strategy:
RAA: Auto-Protect, Darkproof, Auto-Haste
RWA: Slowstrike, Break Damage Limit, Evade & Counter
First a representation of how boss moves:
[While in air]
-> 'Beak bash'
-> 'Beak bash'
-> Charging
-> Paean of the Heavens
-> repeat...
-> 'Land' - after the attack that crossed 66% HP limit
[While on foot]
-> 'Beak bash' ad infinitum
This is first one of few guys in the arena that has set pattern of attacks,
thus making him ultra easy. Let's talk about strategy, then.
On first and second turn Stratoavis will use 'Beak bash'. If Eva is high, he'll
miss. Otherwise Protect will help you. He'll forfeit his third turn to charge
for Paean. *Defend* before his fourth turn! Defending and Protect will lessen
the damage by 3/4. You now need to cure Darkness (or not, if you equipped
Darkproof). Then the guy repeats his daily routine... booooring. Meanwhile
shell him into oblivion. He's vulnerable to all four Breaks and can also be
slowed down.

15. Special note: For unlocking Stratoavis you'll get 99x Stamina Tonic.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

---> MALBORO MENACE <--- ---> A335

1. Name: Malboro Menace
2. Monster's HP: 640000/12000
3. Monster's MP: 200
4. AP gained when monster is defeated: 8000/8000
5. Items stolen: 4x Remedy/2x Mana Spring
6. Items dropped: 2x/4x Mana Tonic; 1x/2x Dark Matter
7. Monster's status info:
- Immune: Armor Break, Berserk, Confusion, Darkness, Death, Delay skills, Demi,
Eject, Magic Break, Mental Break, Petrify, Poison, Power Break, Provoke,
Silence, Sleep, Slow, Threaten, Zombie
- Susceptible: Nothing
- 200 turns for Doom
8. Monster's stats info:
St, Df, Mg, Mf, Ag, Lu, Ev, Ac
60, 24, 53, 63, 34, 15, 0,  120
9. Monster's el. info: Weak to fire, absorbs water
10. Monster's equip. dropped info: 3-4 slots, 1-4 abilities already present,
99% probability of equipment piece being dropped
11. Weapon abilities: Darkstrike, Poisonstrike, Silencestrike, Sleepstrike,
Slowstrike, Stonestrike, Zombiestrike
12. Armor abilities: Darkproof, Poisonproof, Silenceproof, Sleepproof,
Slowproof, Stoneproof, Zombieproof
13. Monster's attacks:
a) Putrid Breath - NATT VS all chrs - mgd + Poison, Confusion, Darkness,
Silence, Berserk and Slow (Darkness and Silence are lifted after eight chr's
turns)
b) Chow Time - VS one chr - phd
c) Mega Gastric Juice - STATT VS one chr - std + Full Break
d) Gastric Juice Blast - VS all chrs - phd + Petrify

14. Monster strategy:
RAA: Auto-Protect, Ribbon (if unavailable, put on at least Stoneproof and
Confuseproof), Auto-Haste
RWA: First Strike, Break Damage Limit, Evade & Counter, Firestrike
Another Malboro enemy. This guy will always ambush you on first turn and will
use Putrid Breath. If you don't have Confuseproof, bye-bye. See you next time.
Well, you're not out of the weeds yet. On his next turns you may get to see
Mega Gastric Juice (which strangely can be avoided with high Eva, but I can't
seem to reduce the damage done in any way, so that means damage done is fixed),
Chow Time (big phd to one chr) and Gastric Juice Blast, which can petrify all
chrs. Get that Stoneproof armor now!
So survive first turn with Confuseproof. Cast Hastega. Then keep attacking
(Overdrives!) Malboro until he bites the dust. After further testdrives I
discovered that Malboro Menace will use Putrid Breath after he's been target of
seven attacks - in other words, once you attack Malboro for seventh time,
you'll receive Putrid Breath on next turn. Gastric Juice Blast seems to be used
often after you knock off half of Malboro's health.

15. Special note: For unlocking Malboro Menace you'll get 99x Poison Fang.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

---> KOTTOS <--- ---> A290

1. Name: Kottos
2. Monster's HP: 440000/15000
3. Monster's MP: 20
4. AP gained when monster is defeated: 8000/8000
5. Items stolen: 4x Stamina Spring/2x Soul Spring
6. Items dropped: 20x/40x Healing Spring; 1x/2x Dark Matter
7. Monster's status info:
- Immune: Armor Break, Berserk, Confusion, Darkness, Death, Delay skills, Demi,
Eject, Magic Break, Mental Break, Petrify, Poison, Power Break, Provoke,
Silence, Sleep, Slow, Threaten, Zombie
- Susceptible: Nothing
- 200 turns for Doom
8. Monster's stats info:
St, Df, Mg, Mf, Ag, Lu, Ev, Ac
88, 60, 12, 1,  36, 15, 0,  150
9. Monster's el. info: NS
10. Monster's equip. dropped info: 2-3 slots, 1-3 abilities already present,
99% probability of equipment piece being dropped
11. Weapon abilities: Counter, Evade & Counter, Magic Counter
12. Armor abilities: HP+10%, HP+20%, HP+30%
13. Monster's attacks:
a) 'Double punch' - VS one chr - phd
b) 'Punch' - CATT VS one chr - phd

14. Monster strategy:
RAA: Auto-Protect, Auto-Haste, Auto-Phoenix
RWA: Break Damage Limit, Counter-attack, First Strike
First a representation of how boss moves:
-> 'Double punch'
-> 'Double punch' ad infinitum
-> 'Punch' - used as a counter
This guy is hardly a challenge at all. His only real power lies in huge
strength. When it's not his turn, he'll just stand there with his dukes put up
and waving 'Come get some!'. Anything you do to him will prompt Kottos to
counterattack with 'punch'. On his regular turns he'll attack with 'double
punch'. Any of these two attacks may knock a character out if your Def stat is
low. And that's all there is to it.
As battle starts, cast Hastega, then Protect on all. After that, pummel away at
Kottos until he's creamed. If someone gets KO-ed, revive, Haste, Protect. Box
match finished!

15. Special note: For unlocking Kottos you'll get 99x Soul Spring.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

---> COEURLREGINA <--- ---> A101

1. Name: Coeurlregina
2. Monster's HP: 380000/10000
3. Monster's MP: 80
4. AP gained when monster is defeated: 8000/8000
5. Items stolen: 2x Farplane Wind/1x Blessed Gem
6. Items dropped: 3x/6x Shining Gem; 1x/2x Dark Matter
7. Monster's status info:
- Immune: Armor Break, Berserk, Confusion, Darkness, Death, Delay skills, Demi,
Eject, Magic Break, Mental Break, Petrify, Poison, Power Break, Provoke,
Silence, Sleep, Slow, Threaten, Zombie
- Susceptible: Nothing
- 200 turns for Doom
8. Monster's stats info:
St, Df, Mg, Mf, Ag, Lu, Ev, Ac
1,  40, 70, 40, 75, 15, 0,  100
9. Monster's el. info: NS
10. Monster's equip. dropped info: 2-3 slots, 1-3 abilities already present,
99% probability of equipment piece being dropped
11. Weapon abilities: Deathstrike, Double AP
12. Armor abilities: Darkproof, Deathproof, Poisonproof, Silenceproof,
Sleepproof, Slowproof, Stoneproof, Zombieproof
13. Monster's attacks:
a) Chaos - VS one chr - inflicts Confusion, Curse and Doom
b) Hyper Blaster - VS one chr - inflicts KO - Deathproof doesn't help
c) Drain - VS one chr - amount of HP deducted from attacked chr is added to
Coeurlregina's HP
d) Thundaga - LATT VS one chr - lightning mgd

14. Monster strategy:
RAA: Curseproof, Confuseproof and/or Ribbon (Ribbon nullifies Doom), Auto-
Phoenix
RWA: Break Damage Limit, First Strike
Mostly used attack is Chaos. If you don't have any Ribbons, chr afflicted is
gone on fifth turn. And if you also don't have Confuseproof, oops. Character/s
that could do the reviving may get knocked out as well by the confused chr.
Auto-Phoenix is nearly a must in this battle. Regina's Hyper Blaster is
guaranteed KO. Revive immediately. When she decides to use Drain or Thundaga (I
was finally able to see it, yay me [sarcastic smile]), praise be to Yevon. As
for Menace, I haven't yet figured out her move pattern, if there even is one.
After much fighting I stand to believe that there is no set pattern for her
moves. Summoning aeons is *not* recommended, as even they get KO-ed by Hyper
Blaster when Regina decides to use it.
Battle starts, Hastega! Then hack away. On doomed chrs cast Auto-Life, and
revive fallen ones ASAP. You win.

15. Special note: For unlocking Coeurlregina you'll get 99x Candle of Life.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

---> JORMUNGAND <--- ---> A280

1. Name: Jormungand
2. Monster's HP: 520000/10000
3. Monster's MP: 63
4. AP gained when monster is defeated: 8000/8000
5. Items stolen: 4x Petrify Grenade/1x Three Stars
6. Items dropped: 2/4x Supreme Gem; 1x/2x Dark Matter
7. Monster's status info:
- Immune: Berserk, Confusion, Darkness, Death, Delay skills, Demi, Eject,
Petrify, Poison, Provoke, Silence, Sleep, Threaten, Zombie
- Susceptible: 90% Armor Break, 90% Magic Break, 90% Mental Break, 90% Power
Break, no % resistance to Slow
- 200 turns for Doom
8. Monster's stats info:
St, Df, Mg, Mf, Ag, Lu, Ev, Ac
77, 33, 80, 186,53, 15, 6,  130
9. Monster's el. info: NS
10. Monster's equip. dropped info: 3-4 slots, 1-4 abilities already present,
99% probability of equipment piece being dropped
11. Weapon abilities: Darkstrike, Poisonstrike, Silencestrike, Sleepstrike,
Slowstrike, Stonestrike, Zombiestrike
12. Armor abilities: Darkproof, Poisonproof, Silenceproof, Sleepproof,
Slowproof, Stoneproof, Zombieproof
13. Monster's attacks:
a) Cold Stare - STATT VS one chr - std + Petrify - ignores Shell and Protect
b) Space-Time Vorpal - NATT VS all chrs - mgd
c) 'Bash' - VS one chr - phd

14. Monster strategy:
RAA: Auto-Protect, Auto-Haste, Stoneproof, Auto-Shell
RWA: Break Damage Limit, Counter-attack, First Strike, Slowstrike
Cold Stare is most dangerous. Use Esuna or Soft on chr affected immediately.
'Bash' can be avoided with high Eva, and Space-Time Vorpal halved with Shell.
As battle starts, Hastega, then Shell, then Protect. Start hacking or
Overdriving. Take care of Cold Stare. If you let Jormungand attack petrified
chr, he/she'll be gone for rest of battle. Slow Jorm down a bit as well, then
finally kill him.
He doesn't have set movement pattern.

15. Special note: For unlocking Jormungand you'll get 99x Petrify Grenade.

Senior knight of Force trio. Ugh, this is a definition of Evasion. Unless you
bear monster Acc and a bit of Luck, forget about killing this guy. Return
later... or not? Kingie counters everything with 10000 Needles. On regular
turns he may use 10000 Needles, or 99999 Needles, or Run Away. He's also immune
to all elemental skills you may decide to chuck at it and can't be bad-statused
whatsoever. Summoning an aeon gets a no-no again. Even with Shield command in
effect you cannot reduce damage received from Needle attacks.
As battle starts, rely on Tidus' Blitz Ace to try killing King. Don't forget
that for this battle it is better to have Auto-Haste in your armors, cos when
chr is revived, he'll automatically be in Haste. If one Blitz Ace isn't enough,
Entrust Tidus with Overdrive gauges from other peeps, then attack again and
this time he should go down.
He doesn't have set movement pattern.

11. Weapon abilities: Str+5%, Str+10%, Str+20%
12. Armor abilities: Def+5%, Def+10%, Def+20%
13. Monster's attacks:
a) Hades Claws - (CATT) VS one chr - phd + Poison and KO - restores big chunk
of Espada's HP as well
b) Blade Shower - VS one chr - phd - is used after four Hades Claws (including
ones launched as counterattacks)

14. Monster strategy:
RAA: Auto-Protect, Auto-Haste, Auto-Phoenix
RWA: Break Damage Limit, Counter-attack, First Strike, Slowstrike
First a representation of how Espada moves:
-> Hades Claws - either normal attack or counter
-> Hades Claws - either normal attack or counter
-> Hades Claws - either normal attack or counter
-> Hades Claws - either normal attack or counter
-> Blade Shower - can only be used on regular turn
-> Hades Claws... - pattern repeats
This is second predictive guy you can fight. Count number of times he uses
Hades Claws. After you counted four, on first regular turn Espada gets, he'll
use Blade Shower. Even if there are more Hades Claws used (because of
counterattacks), number resets to 0 after Blade Shower is used.
Example 1: You don't attack Espada at all, instead he gets four turns in which
he uses Hades Claws, then Blade Shower on fifth.
Example 2: Don't attack Espada until he does three Hades Claws to your party.
Then attack him three times. He'll counter with Hades Claws for each attack,
thus adding the total to six Hades Claws. On first turn Espada gets he will use
Blade Shower. The number of Hades Claws now resets to zero - Espada does not
need two more Hades Claws, but four.
I don't recommend fighting this guy unless you have very high Agi and Eva.
Reason is this: connected Hades Claws restore insane amount of HP to Espada,
thus nullifying your efforts to cripple his HP. Plus he has a constant Regen
effect. When Agi and Eva are high, then engage in battle and laugh as he won't
be able to hit you. What, you want to regen? Yeah right, I'll kill you first.

13. Monster's attacks:
a) 'Headbutt' - VS one chr - phd
b) Swallow - after Abyss Worm has been target of an attack for fifth time,
it'll Swallow whoever landed the fifth strike - eaten character is gone from
battle until following happens
c) Regurtitate - after Abyss Worm (with chr inside!) has been target of two
further attacks, chr eaten is returned to battle - damage dealt is always 9999
- Protect halves the damage
d) Readying Quake - signifies charge turn for Earthquake
e) Earthquake - NATT VS all chrs - mgd - requires one turn to charge

14. Monster strategy:
RAA: Auto-Protect, Auto-Haste, Auto-Phoenix
RWA: Break Damage Limit, Counter-attack, First Strike
I think this guy has a set pattern of movement too, but I need to figure it out
first. What I was able to confirm is the following:
After you attack Abyss Worm for five times, he'll Swallow that attacker. Now
Abyss will automatically forfeit all turns he gets until you attack it for two
more times. Abyss will now counter with Regurtitate, which will kill the chr
Swallowed by dealing 9999 damage to him/her (halve it with Protect).
On regular turns expect to see 'Headbutt'. After few more turns Worm will be
Readying Quake. Earthquake that follows can be halved with Shell.
As battle starts, Hastega. Then start hacking or Overdriving until you hit it
four times. Wait until Worm starts Readying Quake. Then unload on him as
attacks landed in this part of battle don't count toward Swallow.:) Abyss Worm
is defeated.
Additionally I've found out following: By not attacking Abyss Worm at all,
he'll use two 'headbutts', then Readying Quake on third and Earthquake on
fourth turn, after which he'll repeat the exercise. Furthermore, if you let him
Swallow one chr, there's a way of preventing Worm launching new attacks. With
your other two remaining characters cast Reflect on one of them, then
continously Doublecast Flare with your reflected chr being target of the
attack. Flares will bounce off onto Worm, damage him and most importantly, this
*doesn't* trigger Regurtitate.

AngelWing sent in this strat: Characters I use when fighting it all have
Counter Attack or Evade&Counter ability in their weapons. When the battle
starts, I cast Protect (or no need if you have Auto-Protect) to the party and
slow them - I mean it..... I cast Slowga to my party. Cast Haste to the Abyss
Worm and defend. When it's Abyss Worm's turn, it'll attack (headbutt) one of
your characters and your character will counter it without being countered.
When it is readying for Quake, attack it and the last character before Abyss
Worm's turn should be switched to Yuna. Tell Yuna to Summon or Grand Summon
Valefor then tell Valefor to attack or use Overdrive - but please be careful
since using Overdrive can let Abyss Worm kill Valefor due to the movement
delay. After Earthquake, dismiss Valefor and defend all your characters -
remember to switch Yuna back to your previous character. This might be a slow
and boring way to kill it but it is a safe way especially for someone with low
attributes.
PS: If your characters' Defend is low, the alternate way is to have *one*
character that has preety high defense (in my case, I use Auron) to use
Sentinel while the other two use Cheer and/or Luck.

First attack Geist will use is completely random and cannot be predicted.
However, once you see what Geist has used, you're set for the remainder of

13. Monster's attacks:
a) Karma - CATT & STATT VS one chr - std - damage dealt is amount of enemies
killed (by that particular character) x 100 - can not be used after Don takes
four 'Walk forward' - if chr killed no enemies, damage dealt is zero
b) 'Walk forward' - will do so for 4 turns
c) 'Chef's knife' - VS one chr - phd
d) Voodoo - STATT VS aeon - if aeon is Don's opponent, Voodoo is used - std

14. Monster strategy:
RAA: Auto-Haste, Auto-Phoenix
RWA: Break Damage Limit
First a representation of how Don Tonberry moves:
-> 1st 'Walk forward'
-> 2nd 'Walk forward'
-> 3rd 'Walk forward'
-> before 4th 'Walk forward' any attack against Don will prompt him to counter
with Karma
-> 4th 'Walk forward'
-> 'Chef's Knife'... will always use 'Chef's Knife' from now on
-> Voodoo will be used at any time in battle if an aeon is in Don's way
Not hard, but boring. Anything you will do to Don will upset him. So he'll
counter by counting your Karma and naturally killing character targeted. Either
you kill him with aeons (he doesn't counter their attacks) or wait until he
comes closer four times, then unload on him.

careful of Pop Fly - along with phd it delays chr's next turn. Auto-Phoenix
will take care of reviving your party members that will get taken out cos of
Catoblepas' strong attacks. Take heed and be under Shell at all costs once you

14. Monster strategy:
RAA: Auto-Reflect, Auto-Haste, Curseproof, Ribbon (or Poisonproof), Auto-Shell
RWA: Break Damage Limit, Magic Counter
I'll get the move settlement for this guy as well. I know there's one. Anyway,
keep up Shell status at all times. It'll be your lifesaver. For that annoying
Pharaoh's Curse heal as soon as you can. You need your party to be in fighting
shape at all times. Once you see Mana Focus, Protect if not already under it.
Emblem of the Cosmos is Abaddon's strongest attack. If you think your chrs
won't make it, summon an aeon.
Once battle starts, Hastega then Shell. Using any elemental attacks against
Abaddon is useless, as he has infinite NulAll and Reflect. If you're reflected,
Doublecast Flare at his royal ass. Use Quick Hits or Overdrives (Banishing
Blade!). Abaddon is defeated.
Yahoo! Found a hole in his pattern - after you deal damage to Abaddon for sixth
time, he'll use Mana Focus on first turn he gets after that. Which means I can
provide new strategic information - if you can get at least six attacks in once
Abaddon releases Emblem, all attacks you'll be seeing will be Mana Focus and
Emblem of the Cosmos.

14. Monster strategy:
RAA: Auto-Haste, Auto-Shell, Auto-Protect

Last bastard in area creations. Body Splash and 'stomp' can be halved with
Protect, Mortar with Shell. Vorban counters with Mortar after he's been target
of one attack, two or three attacks - with more experimentation I found out
that he also counters if you try say Stealing... anyway, he counters anything.
Longest I've been able to try to do something was three times before he
Mortared me.
As battle starts, Hastega, Protect and finally Shell. Attack with Quick Hits
and Overdrives. Take note to heal if you think next Mortar counter may kill a
chr. Banishing Blade (with successful input) will help you a lot in lowering
Vorban's defence. He doesn't have set movement pattern.

Auto-Phoenix in yor armor - one worry is already off your back (Fangs of Hell
inflict KO regardless of protection). The other thing you need to worry about
is Confusion inflicted by Fangs of Chaos - also remember to heal chr that was
attacked quickly. That's not much HP he/she has left.
As battle starts, Hastega, then Protect. Proceed with attacking Fenrir with
Blitz Aces or Attack Reels. Note, that you may need a high Acc in order to be
able to hit Fenrir (not necessary if you'll be using Overdrives). Hell Fangs
can be avoided with high Eva, but other two can't.

b) Poison Touch - GRATTP VS one chr - phd + Poison - tears off 75% current HP

14. Monster strategy:
RAA: Auto-Haste, Auto-Protect, Auto-Phoenix, Poisonproof
RWA: Break Damage Limit, Counter-attack, First Strike
Luckily for you, this guy can't petrify you like his other species buddies. He
has two attacks, both of which are annoying. Drain Touch will steal your HP and
add them to Orni's, while Poison Touch removes 75% of current HP and adds
Poison. If you forget or don't heal Poisoned chr, he/she may die of an action
he/she took. High Acc is also recommended, as Orni's Eva is quite high.
He doesn't have set movement pattern.

15. Special note: For unlocking Ornitholestes you'll get 99x Stamina Spring.

13. Monster's attacks:
a) Beak of Woe - VS one chr *or* VS all chrs - phd + Curse - ignores Protect
b) Beak - VS one chr - phd + delays next turn

14. Monster strategy:
RAA: Auto-Haste, Auto-Protect, Auto-Phoenix, Curseproof
RWA: Break Damage Limit, Counter-attack, First Strike
A low HP creation... but a nasty one at that. Most often he'll ambush you, in
which case it'll use Beak of Woe on all chrs (phd + Curse). Don't bother
healing Curse, as you'll just be re-Cursed. To compensate for lack of HP, he
has two alternatives - constant Regen and high Eva. If you can't seem to pull
off enough damage, call Anima or Magus Sisters. One or two Pains, Passado,
Razzia...
After more counting of Pteryx's feathers I've found out more: First turn it'll
always be Beak of Woe vs all chrs. If you un-Curse one chr, on next turn Pteryx
gets he will use Beak of Woe against that chr to Curse him/her again. With all
chrs Cursed Pteryx otherwise uses Beak for moderate phd - beware, Beak will
also delay chr's next turn.

d) Curaga - on itself - restores big amount of HP

14. Monster strategy:
RAA: Auto-Haste, Auto-Protect, Auto-Phoenix, Confuseproof, Deathproof, Ribbon,
Poisonproof
RWA: Break Damage Limit, Counter-attack, First Strike
A flying Fenrir? Seriously, tho', Hornet packs similar attacks. Bewitching Stab
can be made useless with Confuseproof, and Venomous Stab with Poisonproof.
Regular Hornet's attack can be made harmless with Deathproof.
As battle starts, Hastega, then Protect. Heal status disorder soon and revive
fallen allies. High Acc (use Aim few times) may be needed to be able to hit
Hornet. He doesn't have set movement pattern.

14. Monster strategy:
RAA: Auto-Haste, Auto-Shell, Auto-Phoenix
RWA: Break Damage Limit, Magic Counter, First Strike
Everything he chucked at me were Osmose and Ultima. Nothing else dangerous.
Auto-Shell will make Ultima's damage laughable. So will you once you smite down
his ugly ass. To pose at least an intermediate challenge, he has been granted
infinite NulAll and Regen statuses.
He doesn't have set movement pattern.

14. Monster strategy:
RAA: Auto-Haste, Auto-Protect, Auto-Phoenix, Curseproof, Confuseproof, Ribbon
RWA: Break Damage Limit, Counter-attack, First Strike
Like Pteryx, he likes to get a jump on you, in which case Shockwave is
unavoidable. You'll get Confused, Sleeped, Silenced, Darknessed and Slowed.
Cure any way you can, then smack down its ugly face. Black Stare is nothing to
be feared of - it's simple damage and Curse to one.
About 30 One-Eyes later I can report on following: He alternates between
Shockwave and Black Stare, no more than two Shockwaves in a row, and no more
than five Black Stares in a row.

amount of HP

14. Monster strategy:
RAA: Auto-Haste, Auto-Shell, Auto-Phoenix
RWA: Break Damage Limit, First Strike
Long, boring and tiresome. Jumbo Flan is immune to any weapon-based attack,
absorbs all elements sans holy, is under constant Reflect and packs a big HP.
For starters cast Hastega, then Reflect on one of your chrs. Now Doublecast
Flare, but make sure you target chr you just reflected. That way Flares will
hit Jumbo Flan. Oh yeah, Jumbo can be Slowed as well - maybe this isn't going
to take long, after all.:) Now repeatedly Copycat these two Flares you just
casted and sooner or later Jumbo will subdue to missing HP. Sometimes if low on
HP, Jumbo will attempt the following: he'll cast Reflect on one of your chrs,
then *immediately* Curaga. On next turn/s he'll do Reflect/Curaga combo again
(in case you dispeled Reflect), Regen (in case you don't dispel Reflect) or
Ultima. Speaking of which, I believe that lower Jumbo is to defeat, more of
Ultima you'll be seeing.
Anima's Pain is the answer to your needs. It bypasses Reflect and is a magical
attack. Spare Change deals damage to Jumbo as well. And physical Overdrives
inflict damage as well, but don't bother as Jumbo's Def is high. Do not forget
Ifrit's Meteor Strike!
Otherwise he doesn't have set movement pattern.

15. Special note: For unlocking Jumbo Flan you'll get 60x Twin Stars.

14. Monster strategy:
RAA: Auto-Haste, Auto-Shell, Auto-Phoenix

Nega counters any physical attack with Ultima. He doesn't counter magic
attacks, which is what you should use against him. Reflect on yourself, then
Doublecast Flare and Copycat it. Otherwise Nega is pretty boring creation with
usual assortment of elemental spells and Flare. Yawn.
He doesn't have set movement pattern.

b) Rush Attack - VS one chr - phd + Berserk and delays chr's next turn - this
attack also 'speeds up' Tanket's next turn

14. Monster strategy:
RAA: Auto-Haste, Auto-Protect, Auto-Phoenix, Berserkproof
RWA: Break Damage Limit, Counter-attack, First Strike
Danger! Although he appears slow, he has two nasty tricks. Both of his attacks
Berserk the chr attacked and delay that chr's next turn, however, Rush Attack
seems to have an added bonus of 'speeding up' Tanket's next turn. It may even
happen that you won't get anymore attacks in cos Tanket will repeatedly Rush
Attack you to death.
As battle starts, Hastega, then Protect. Unload on the guy, curing Berserk as
you go. Do NOT ignore Berserk or you'll be sorry. Once Tanket's HP is 449999 or
lower, he switches to Rush Attack. If you can't get an attack in even with
Hastega, you're too slow to keep up. You'll need more Agi. Oh, even aeons will
get creamed by Rush Attack. Once he starts Rush Attacking, you're halfway done
- don't give up.

c) *Fire* Triple Attack - VS one chr -> VS all chrs -> VS one chr - phd to one,
then fire mgd to all, then phd to one

14. Monster strategy:
RAA: Auto-Haste, Auto-Protect, Auto-Phoenix, Auto-Shell
RWA: Break Damage Limit, Counter-attack, First Strike
First a representation of how Fafnir moves:
-> 'Bash'
-> Triple Attack *ice*
-> Triple Attack *fire*
-> Triple Attack *lightning*
-> 'Bash'... ad infinitum
Another set-move-pattern enemy. As battle starts, Hastega, Shell, Protect. Then
it's only matter of predicting Fafnir's turns. First 'bash' is Protected. Then
before he gets second turn in, cast NulFrost. Fafnir's Triple Attack targets
one chr, then delivers ice damage to all (which will be nullified), and again
targets one chr. Before third turn cast NulBlaze. Fire-based Triple Attack is
bypassed. Before fourth turn cast NulShock. Lightning-based Triple Attack is
after you. Take note that Triple Attack has same 'effect' than Tanket's Rush
Attack - delays all chr's next turn (or speeds up Fafnir's, whichever sounds
better to you). Now Fafnir will copycat his moves from beginning. All you need
to do is to keep up with him, cast respective Nul spells and heal as necessary.

Yet another I-like-to-ambush-you enemy. If that happens, Goodnight. See you in
next battle.
When battle commences, Hastega, then Shell. You may also want to Reflect
yourself to bounce back any spells Sprout may cast. Okay, all spells sans
Ultima. What's really dangerous is Goodnight (first attack used). All statuses
are manageable, except Berserk. D'you get Berserkproof? Any physicals launched
against Sprout will trigger Goodnight counter. (Split) Magic (Infinity) attacks
(is), however (writer), will (of) not (this). Use (guide) that (if) to (the)
your (name) advantage (at). Spare (top) Change (of) also (document) *won't*
(isn't) trigger (mine) Goodnight (guide). I (is) believe (stolen) that (report)
Sprout will (to) use (lifearmor) Goodnight (at) only (hotmail.com!) on his
first turn, during subsequent ones you'll be seeing an assortment of his magic
attacks.
Sprout otherwise has really low HP. That Regen status he has is supposed to be
a trade-off for measly amount of HP? Nope. Die, fungus!

Destruct

14. Monster strategy:
RAA: Auto-Haste, Auto-Protect, Auto-Phoenix, Fire Eater
RWA: Break Damage Limit, Counter-attack, Magic Counter, First Strike
Inflate me or die! Baaam! Easy. Really. Okay, seriously. Each three attacks on
King that do damage will trigger him to grow. He grows three times, and
*doesn't* explode in last stage. In first stage he uses 'bash', in second Fira,
in third Firaga, in last Ultima. So the motto is - the less attacks you get in,
the faster King dies. That said, sooner you kill Bomb King, less damaging
attacks you'll see.
After having pyrotechnics party for too long, I've found out that if your chr
Counter-Attacks or Magic Counters one of King's attacks, this will not make him
grow.

When battle starts, Hastega, then Protect. Jugi's first turn will be
automatically wasted for Charging. Second turn is nothing to worry about as
well - NulBlaze! Now it gets dangerous. You'll want to see four Crush Spikes
ASAP. Why? As soon as you do, Jugi's next turn will be Charging, meaning you
have two turns to deal damage to him, quite possibly defeating him as well.
Only physical attacks count, as Juggernaut is impervious to any magical damage.

Last species creation. Bearing biggest HP of the bunch you'll want to have high
Eva and Str for this battle.
When battle starts, Hastega and then Protect. Anything funny you try on
Ironclad, he'll try something funny on you - Ironclad counters anything with
Reppageki. Now if your Eva is thru the roof, he'll miss. Bushinzan and
Shinryudan on the other hand always hit. Make sure you heal immediately after
Bushinzan. Restore MP too, as Bushinzan has Osmose effect. Shinryudan will
strike pretty hard, but nothing a quick Phoenix Down couldn't take care of.
With that said, it's only a matter of patience to bring down huge amount of HP
he has to offer.

b) Megaton Punch - (CATT sometimes) VS one *or* two chrs - phd + KO
c) 'Punch' - VS one chr - phd
d) 'Fall back' - after inflicting over 100001 damage when EE is standing, he'll
fall on his back
e) 'Stand up' - after being struck down for two turns, he'll stand up on his
third turn after he was struck down

14. Monster strategy:
Ugh. I-counter-almost-everything arena fiend. For starters, this guy counters
anything with Megaton Punch against random (one!) chr. If not Deathproofed,
bye. One Phoenix Down later... On regular turns EE uses either 'Punch' or
Megaton Punch against *two* chrs! He may strike same chr twice, but that's
random. So first big warning: Megaton Punch counter attacks one chr, Megaton
Punch used on regular turns attacks two chrs.
There's more to it: By dealing exactly or over 100001, EE will fall on his
back. He can't counter with MP anymore, but will now use Flare as a counter.
This is much better than MP, don't you think? He will get back up on his third
turn after being struck down and continue attacking regularly on fourth. And
lastly, EE has constant Reflect.
That's all of the tactical briefing I have, now let's strategize. I usually
bring in Tidus, Yuna and Rikku, all with full Overdrive gauges, Tidus having
either Caladbolg or weapon with Break Damage Limit and knowing Blitz Ace.
Overdrive mode is set on Comrade. Battle starts!
As you see, getting MP-ed until kingdom come is bad, really bad. But that
100001 damage seems manageable, no? So the very first turn we'll want to do in
battle is knocking down EE. First turn cast Haste on everyone. First turn Tidus
gets let him unleash Blitz Ace onto unsuspecting EE - hopefully Tidus' Str is
high enough to deal over 100001 damage to EE. Make that Sphere Shot count in
the end! Alternatively, you could also try Doublecasting reflected Flares or
Ultimas onto EE's ass - the most important thing is to use as less turns as
possible to knock down EE. Once he's decked, Shell everyone. If you have Auto-
Shell already on armor, even better. Then Entrust Tidus with either Rikku's or
Yuna's Ov. gauge. Now continue attacking him while taking care not to get KO-ed
cos of EE's Flares - remember to heal! EE needs to 'waste' two turns now,
before he gets back on his feet. This counts as his turn, hehehe. Now repeat
the exercise from before - Tidus uses Blitz Ace, or Doublecast Flares and
Ultimas, Entrust Tidus with remaining Ov. gauge (Yuna's or Rikku's), recast
Shell in case someone got knocked out anyway and proceed hacking away until he
gets back up ad infinitum.
If you can pull all of this off, only thing you'll ever see from EE is Flare.:)
Happy Fortune Sphere hunting.

a) Ultima - CATT & NATT VS all chrs - mgd
b) Hydraulic Press - (CATT sometimes) & GRATTP VS all chrs - phd - tears off
93,75% MAX HP
c) Elemental Shift - CATT - once you hit Greater Sphere with an element it's
currently weak against, it'll use this to change element properties
d) 'Bash' - VS one chr - phd
e) Flare - CATT VS one chr - mgd
f) Thundaga - CATT VS an aeon - lightning mgd
g) Blizzaga - CATT VS an aeon - ice mgd
h) Firaga - CATT VS an aeon - fire mgd
i) Waterga - CATT VS an aeon - water mgd

14. Monster strategy:
GS counters (nearly) everything - any magic cast at him or physical attack with
Ultima, Overdrives with Hydraulic Press, if certain items are used on it you'll
see Flare counter. On regular turns it may use 'Bash' or Hydraulic Press (which
of the two you can't predict, it's random). If hit with element he's weak
against, Elemental Shift. In case you're using aeons and you have one of them
cast elemental magic on GS, it counters with level 3 element spell - with this
you also get to know its current elemental weakness.:) That's all he has to
offer. I bet you'd like to see only 'Bash' and Hydraulic Press, right? I have
just the way for you.
Bring in Yuna, Tidus, Rikku. Haste and Protect all characters. Finally cast
Reflect on all of them. Now there's no rush! Slowly work the following out.
Whoever goes first, have that chr use any level 1 el. spell, say Fire, on
him/herself. Fire will be reflected to GS. Now it'll either heal him or damage
him... but most importantly, GS *will not* counter with anything. If Fire dealt
damage to him, you just found his weakness. If not, repeat with other three
elements. When you know what he's weak against, simply use the following
strategy: repeatedly Doublecast reflected level 3 GS-is-weak-against-it
elemental magic at him. All attacks you'll ever see from GS are 'Bash' and
Hydraulic Press.:) No Ultima whatsoever. Don't forget to heal after each
Hydraulic Press! This is a gravity attack, yes, but it deals damage depending
on MAX HP. Once GS has about 500000 HP left, finish it off with Blitz Ace or
Attack Reels. Say hi to your Luck Spheres.
Otherwise, whenever you attack GS directly, you'll see Ultima counter. I
needn't mention this is extremely boring, having to sit thru 16 animations of
Ultima before GS is defeated (assuming you hit for 99999 damage). I'm not
saying it isn't good, it's just boring. If you feel you're up to the task, then
certainly go for it.
Absolutely the fastest way to defeat Greater Sphere: Tidus and two other
members have full Overdrive gauges (these two members must also know Entrust).
As battle starts, use Tidus' Blitz Ace. See Hydraulic Press counter. Have
second person Entrust his/her gauge to Tidus, who uses Blitz Ace again. Repeat
for third time and GS is gone. You can do the same with Wakka's Attack Reels,
in which case you only need one other person with full Overdrive gauge.
I've also figured out how come that GS can also start countering reflected
magic. In the battle against it as soon as you attack it directly
(physical/magical attack against it, or maybe a counterslice to its 'Bash'),
you can't reflect magic off of your characters and not see Ultima anymore.
Anytime after GS takes damage in one of the cases mentioned in parenthesis,
you'll see Ultima after reflected magic hits GS.

13. Monster's attacks:
a) Toxic Cloud - NATT VS all chrs - mgd + Poison, Confusion and Curse
b) 'Bust out' - after dealing over 450001 damage while Catastrophe is in shell,
first attack that deal damage which will cross 450000 of total damage already
done to it will force him to come out of the shell
c) Toxic Spray - VS one chr - phd + Full Break - always used on chr with most
current HP
d) Demi - GRATT VS all chrs - mgd - tears off 25% current HP
e) Hundred Thorns - VS all chrs - phd

14. Monster strategy:
Yes. Set-pattern-bozo at last!
Prepare any way you want, since this guy is so predictable.
First a representation of how Catastrophe moves:
-> Toxic Cloud
-> C. skips a turn
-> Toxic Cloud
-> C. skips a turn... ad infinitum
[first attack that goes over 450001 damage dealt]
-> 'Bust out' used as a countermove to that attack
-> Toxic Spray
-> Demi
-> Hundred Thorns... ad infinitum pattern goes repeating itself
For first half of battle (until it comes out of the shell) C. will alternate
between Toxic Cloud and skipping next turn. Make sure you wear Confusion
protection! Don't let your chrs go wild. Keep attacking C. until you cross
450001 damage dealt limit, which is when it busts out of the shell. Yawn, so
many repetitive guys.
First turn C. gets in this form is Toxic Spray against one chr. Besides damage
it includes Full Break on attacked chr, so beware. Use Dispel on affected chr
to remove those Breaks. C.'s next turn is a laugh - I mean, Demi? Hah. However,
his next turn is not a laugh... Hundred Thorns, big phd to all chrs - Armor
Breaked chr, if still not healed, is gone for sure, and other two may barely
make it - Protect yourself prior to this attack! After Hundred Thorns C.
returns to basics - Toxic Spray, Demi, Hundred Thorns. Don't forget to Protect
and Shell your chrs! Apart from this tips all I wish you is winning against
this oversized whatever.:)

12. Armor abilities: HP+10%, HP+20%, HP+30%
13. Monster's attacks:
a) 'Swipe' - VS one chr - phd
b) Haste - CATT on himself - some status altering attacks/magic trigger Haste
counter
c) Protect - on itself - adds Protect
d) Shell - on itself - adds Shell
e) Regen - on itself - adds Regen
f) Rainbow - VS all chrs - phd + Sleep, Silence, Darkness, Confusion and Curse
(Sleep, Silence and Darkness last for three chr's turns)
g) Convergence - NATT VS one chr - mgd
h) Condemn - CATT VS all chrs - phd + removes ANY positive status (Auto-Life
included)

14. Monster strategy:
Yes. Another set-pattern-bozo!
First a representation of how Th'uban moves:
-> Swipe
-> Rainbow
-> Protect / Shell / Regen / skips a turn
-> Convergence
-> Haste anytime in-between this attacks as a counter to some status attacks
-> Condemn anytime in-between this attacks as a counter to most attacks
Rule 1: Condemn removes any beneficial status. This includes Auto-Life.
Rule 2: Th'uban counters everything *except* reflected magic and some other
special cases. So start Doublecasting reflected Flares on the triple.
Rule 3: You must have Sleepproof and Confuseproof (or Ribbon) in your armor.
Rule 4: On 3rd, 7th, 11th, 15th and so on turns Th'uban goes like this...
- if not under Protect, Shell and Regen; if under Shell and Regen -> Protect
- if under Protect; Protect and Regen -> Shell
- if under Protect and Shell -> Regen
- if under Protect, Shell and Regen -> skips a turn
We've ruled out what to do, now let's discuss how to beat this guy. Cast Auto-
Life on all your chrs. Then cast Haste/ga, Protect, and finally Reflect. Wear
Sleepproof and Confuseproof armors! Now continuosly Doublecast Flares - make
sure you reflect them off your chrs. Otherwise Th'uban will counter with
Condemn and remove all statuses you worked hard to achieve. On first Th'uban's
turn he'll 'Swipe' one chr. Nothing dangerous. When you get hit with Rainbow,
this is nothing dangerous again as long as you have Sleepproof and Confuseproof
armors. Whatever Th'uban uses on third turn, Dispel it! On fourth turn you will
lose one chr - recently I discovered that Convergence deals 99999 damage
regardless of Mdef stat; however, Shell status reduces damage done by
Convergence to a mere 60000 or so. Th'uban then returns to regular program -
'Swipe', Rainbow, Shell/Protect/Reflect, Convergence.
If you'll kill him with physical attacks, remember that any protections you
casted will be removed after Th'uban's counter. The method I recommend the most
is reflected magic. If however, you have 255 Def and Agi, then by all means
proceed by the hacking corridor.
I've also figured out how come that Th'uban can also start countering reflected
magic. In the battle against him as soon as you attack him directly
(physical/magical attack against him, or maybe a counterslice to his 'Swipe'),
you can't reflect magic off of your characters and not see Condemn anymore.
Anytime after Th'uban takes damage in one of the cases mentioned in
parenthesis, you'll see Condemn after reflected magic hits Th'uban. You can
Dispel his support magics without fear of Condemn, though.

15. Special note: For unlocking Th'uban you'll get 99x Gambler's Spirit.

12. Armor abilities: HP+10%, HP+20%, HP+30%
13. Monster's attacks:
a) Megaton - STATT VS one chr - std + KO and Confusion - ignores any protection
b) 'Lick' - VS one chr - phd
c) Slime - STATT VS all chrs - std + Poison, Curse, Armor Break and Mental
Break - ignores any protection
d) 'Retreat in shell' - once you deal 2000000 to him, Neslug will retreat into
his shell
e) 'Come out' - once Neslug restores all HP to itself or you destroy his shell,
it'll come back out
f) Curaga - on oneself - restores big amount of HP - used only when in shell

14. Monster strategy:
The only original *original* fiend. All other seven are I-saw-him-before
bosses. Most dangerous attack by Neslug is Slime - attacks all chrs, does
Poison, Curse and two Breaks. I lived too long in delusion, but it is a fact
that you can't shut off Slime by Silencing Neslug - only use for Silence so far
is that Neslug isn't able to use Curaga when he's inside the shell. When you
get affected, heal Poison first, then Breaks (with Dispel!). Megaton will
Confuse and possibly KO chr unless protected. 'Lick' is your standard physical
attack. Neslug retreats into his shell once he has 1999999 HP remaining,
whereas he gains Regen and will use Curaga on his turns, unless Silenced. You
must bring his HP under 999999 now, which will break the shell. Attacks used
from now on are Megaton, 'Lick' and Slime. BTW, I also noticed that Neslug
becomes faster when the shell is gone, so beware.
When battle starts, cast Hastega, then Protect. Silence Neslug as your first
attack! Note also how much damage you did to him. If you can hit Neslug for
99999 with physicals, do so for exactly 20 times. The total damage done to
Neslug is 1999980. A special chart:
Round 1 (Neslug's HP is between 4000000 and 2000000):
- attack Neslug for so long until total damage done is 2000000 or less
- don't go over 2000000 yet or you'll screw up this strategy
- Neslug attacks with Megaton, 'Lick' and Slime
- for an attack crossing 2000000 mark use an Overdrive, Blitz Ace or Attack
Reels
Round 2 (Neslug's HP is between 1999999 and 1000000):
- Neslug is impervious to any physical attack, however, Blitz Ace still deals
damage... a glitch?
- Neslug can restore somewhere between 65000 and 100 HP to himself for each
turn someone gets
- you must bring his total HP down below 1000000 so his shell breaks
- immediately after you Blitz Aced (more recommended is Slice&Dice, as it has
faster recovery rate) Neslug for first time, have someone else from active
party Entrust Tidus with Ov. gauge - meanwhile the other character Doublecasts
Flares/Ultimas in order to nullify Neslug's efforts to heal HP
- as soon as Tidus' turn comes up, use Blitz Ace or Slice&Dice immediately
- Bang! Neslug's shell is broken
- if you manage to get perfect Attack Reels, ie 12 hits, damage done by this
attack will be 1199988, which means you won't even see Round 2, cos Neslug's
shell will be instantly broken
Round 3 (Neslug's HP is between 999999 and 0):
- defeat it

13. Monster's attacks:
a) 'Block' - any attack directed at the body will cause arm (or both if still
alive) to move in the way to block and reduce the damage
b) 'The arms regenerated!' - after Buster spends few turns without its arms,
they'll regenerate

14. Monster strategy:
First a description of how boss acts in battle.
Head of the boss goes like this: it forfeits its first turn and grants it to
torso of the boss, which unleashes 'Punch'. Second turn it'll 'start to move
suspiciously'. Third turn it releases Contamination, which poisons, zombifies
and full breaks one chr *regardless* of protections. In case you attack the
head to stop it from moving, Contamination is forfeited. Instead head returns
to step one, which would be forfeiting its turn and granting the attack to
torso of the boss.
Torso has a set pattern as well... kinda. It will alternate like this: one or
two turns of 'Punch' (including a free attack it gets from the head), then
either Ultima or Ultima+'Punch' combo. If head is killed, you will see this
pattern: Ultima, Ultima+'Punch', Ultima, Ultima+'Punch' etc. No 'Punch' attack
whatsoever.
As it may appear, killing the head is bad idea. I agree and don't recommend
killing the head. It's not that big of a deal to chuck a low class spell at
head to disable Contamination. Did you know that Contamination can poison and
zombify even aeons? Try it and you'll see. Enough tech blabber, let's talk
fight strategy.
Use Tidus, Yuna and Rikku. First have Rikku Mix Trio of 9999, Tidus use
Hastega, and Yuna Protect and Shell on all chrs. When you're set, start using
Quick Hits. If low on health, use Pray special. It'll restore 9999 HP to all
three chrs cos of Mix we used before.
Buster's first three attacks are almost guaranteed to be 'Punch', 'Punch', then
Ultima. About now head would be moving suspiciously. Use Fire or something on
it and it'll shut up until next time. In case you're too busy to do it, take
heed that chr hit will get Poison, Zombie and Full Break. Heal Poison first,
then Break, then Zombie. If you choose to kill the head - it has about 120000
HP.
Buster doesn't have just the head, it also has two more sidekicks. They block
any and all physical damage directed at the torso, thus lessening the damage
greatly. Heh, if you have Celestial weapons, even these two sidekicks are
powerless. When they're destroyed, it takes about three torso's turns for them
to regenerate.
Last pointers: I don't recommend killing the head, but if you have pretty high
Mdef and Def, with which you can sustain enormous damage done by Ultima spell,
then by all means make just one change: kill the head then Quick Hit Buster to
death, healing when necessary.

12. Armor abilities: Auto-Med
13. Monster's attacks:
a) 'Swipe' - (CATT) VS one chr - phd
b) Eraser - VS one chr - inflicts Petrify - can't be avoided - cannot be used
if only one chr is able to fight at any given time - I think it is never used
sooner than third Shinryu's regular turn
c) Shining - NATT VS all chrs - deals 8 hits between random targets - mgd

14. Monster strategy:
Ruby Weapon strategy-copier! Heh.
This guy has only three attacks, two of which make your life annoying. First is
'Swipe' - counters anything you do to him. The other is Eraser - petrifies one
chr and shatters him/her, thus making it unavailable for rest of battle. Argh.
And he can remove two chrs. Grrrr.
IMO Shinryu is not hard as it seems. Preparations you need to take care of:
armor with Auto-Potion, Auto-Protect, Auto-Shell, Auto-Haste. Have only X-
Potions available for healing with Auto-Potion. Weapon with Counter-Attack and
Break Damage Limit (Caladbolg for example). At least somewhat decent Def and
Mdef.
Once battle starts, Haste chr you'll use for the battle. Personally I used
Tidus. Then KO Wakka and Rikku. With this you'll never see Eraser, as Tidus is
only chr left that is able to fight. Strategy? You attack Shinryu, he attacks
you. He 'Swipe'-s you, you attack him. This is all as counters. If hit by
Shining, don't worry. Auto-Shell will lessen the damage. Even healing is taken
care of cos of Auto-Potion. As soon as Tidus' HP falls below 50%, Auto-Potion
kicks in with an X-Potion being used on Tidus. Now it's only matter of patience
to beat Shinryu for good.

15. Special note: For unlocking Shinryu you'll get 30x Megalixir.

d) Armageddon - STATT VS all chrs - std - always deals 99999 damage
e) Ultra Spark - STATT VS all chrs - std + Slow, Curse, Poison and Power Break
- damage done cannot be halved in any way

14. Monster strategy:
RWA: Counter-Attack, Magic Counter, Break Damage Limit
RAA: Auto-Haste, Auto-Protect, Auto-Shell, Poisonproof, Ribbon
I have been able to decipher some of Nemesis' attack pattern:
- Armageddon can be used on 9th, 10th or 11th regular turn Nemesis gets; which
turn it cannot be predicted
- on other regular turns he may either 'Swipe' you, use Ethereal Cannon or
Ultra Spark
- You'll never see two Ethereal Cannons consecutively (physical attacks in-
between excluded); same applies for Ultra Spark; ie once you see Ultra Spark,
one of next attacks may be Cannon (or Armageddon, if 10th turn is nearing
close); or else once you see Cannon, one of next attacks may be Spark (or
Armageddon, if 10th turn is nearing close)
- Steal from him (if you want his spheres so badly, use Mug instead - this will
not trigger Ultima), Overdrive him, or use Special ability on him... you'll see
Ultima counter
For the battle itself I can provide you with following strategic tips:
- have your HP at least 35000 (or 18000, which you can double with Stamina
Tonic when in battle)
- 'Swipe' deals about 15000 damage, Ethereal Cannon 20000, Ultima 5000 to all,
Ultra Spark 32000 to all, Armaggedon 99999 damage to all
- everything but Ultra Spark and Armageddon can be reduced with Protect and
Shell
- before every 9th Nemesis' turn *make sure* you either Auto-Life all chrs or
summon an aeon to take Armaggedon damage for you
- use Quick Hits to attack Nemesis and Quick Pockets to heal
Unfortunately it appears that Nemesis doesn't have 100% set attack pattern
except for few discrepancies as outlined above.

Note:
I have been given info that Nemesis has 8 possible attack set-ups, thus making
him at least somehow predictable. With this in mind I entered into battle
against Nemesis and compiled following info.
I - Whatever attack pattern was present in NTSC version, it's sure as hell gone
for PAL.
II - Support for my theory is here below, where you see 11 possible attack
patterns I was 'lucky' enough to be target of. Even when I thought I had the
guy, Nemesis used a different attack. Argh!

Thus you have conquered Monster Arena at last. All of the created bosses that
poor geezer created have had their behinds handed to them. After you toast
Nemesis, you'll be awarded Mark of Conquest (for those, who have surpassed
mortal bounds). Yeah, right, I've surpassed even more. But toughest challenge
awaits you yet...



=============================================================================
=============================================================================
IX) ABOUT DARK AEONS
=============================================================================
=============================================================================

IMPORTANT NOTE: Dark Aeons are only available in PAL and International versions
of the game. They cannot be fought in NTSC version of the game!

Dark Aeons are where the true challenge lies. Undeniably they're the hardest
bosses in the game (along with Nemesis). There's eight Dark Aeons. Once all of
them are defeated, a new boss, Penance, will be unlocked. Return to NavMap and
pick new destination that showed up in the drop menu...

Q1 - Where are these guys?
A1 - As soon as you get the airship under your command, go to following places:

Dark Valefor - in front of Besaid Village
Dark Ifrit - in Sanubia Desert (go all the way into the desert until you reach
the sand pit where you fought Sandragora for passage to Home; near the pit is a
person standing looking for her daughter; say yes and you'll go on a search;
when prompted, go up...)
Dark Ixion - in Thunder Plains (when you select Thunder Plains in ship's
navigator, you'll land in Rin's agency; exit it, then go up; you'll see a
warrior standing below one of the pillars; talk to him...)
Dark Shiva - in front of Macalania Temple (return to Macalania Temple; once you
approach, a Guado summoner will spill the beans and then...)
Dark Bahamut - in Zanarkand ruins, in the same room where you fought Y-woman
Dark Yojimbo - in Cavern of the Stolen Fayth (go all the way into the back of
the cavern; when you try to exit... (don't use the teleport pad!))
Dark Anima - in Mt. Gagazet (remember the first trial in Mt. Gagazet where you
had Wakka and his ball hit a center of some circling thingey?; return to this
spot and repeat the exercise; careful - if you miss, you'll have to fight some
fiends [you can flee], then you can retry...)
Dark Magus Sisters - in Mushroom Rock (return here and you'll see two females
on the road; try going past them...)
Penance - after all dark aeons are defeated, go to airship and choose NavMap;
in fall down menu Penance entry will appear
[Penance destination pic available at following URL:
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/penance_destiny.jpg]

Q2 - I went to the exact location you wrote in Q1, yet no Dark aeon appeared! I
have the airship already and the only boss still left standing is final boss.
What am I doing wrong?
A2 - Dark aeons can ONLY be fought in PAL (ie European countries) and
International versions of FFX. You cannot fight Dark aeons, if you have NTSC
version. Why? Simply because they're *not* in NTSC version.

Q3 - Let me at them!
A3 - *Not* so fast. They can and will wipe the floor with your party if you're
not well prepared.

Q4 - Okay, what do I need?
A4 - Lots of preparations, some of which include:
# An armor consisting of Auto-Phoenix, Ribbon, Auto-Haste, Auto-Protect.
# A weapon consisting of Break Damage Limit, Triple Overdrive, Counter-attack,
Magic Counter. Even better choice are Celestial weapons. However, with custom
made weapons it is possible to defeat first four dark aeons with ease. At 255
Str and a bit of Luck you can deal 99999 damage to Valefor and Shiva. Ifrit and
Ixion will take about 70000 damage per strike.
# Your stats should be beefed up a lot. I suggest maxing out all statistics
except Magic and Luck (but you do need your Luck to be at least 80 or so).
# Don't bother maxing your HP over 9999 as each and every Dark aeon can be
smoked off with 9999 HP... and right strategy of course.
# Learn Quick Hit, Auto-Life and Quick Pockets.

Q5 - Which characters do you recommend?
A5 - Personally I used Tidus (Blitz Ace), Yuna (her aeons can block attacks),
and Rikku (Mix). However, once you max the stats of certain character, none of
them is better than the other. The only difference lies in their Overdrives.

Q6 - Hey! Wakka's Attack Reels deal more damage than Blitz Ace.
A6 - Of course. So you may want to switch Tidus for Wakka. I prefered Tidus
only because of... well, him being the main character.

Q7 - Got all that. Any last minute changes and notes?
A7 - I suggest starting on Dark Valefor. It has the lowest HP of the bunch.
Then eliminate them in order you got them thru the game (with few exceptions).
Fighting Dark Aeons is useful cos they like to drop an armor piece with Ribbon
already on it.

For first four dark aeons you will do very well with weapons having Break
Damage Limit, One MP Cost, Magic Counter, Counter-Attack.

Now let's begin. In ship's NavMap choose Besaid Island as your next
destination. Walk all the way up to Promontory and *save* your game. Walk to
the entrance of village and let the battle begin.

b) Energy Blast - STATT VS all chrs - std

18. Monster strategy:
[Dark Valefor pic available at following URL:
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/dark_valefor.jpg]
RAA: Auto-Haste, Auto-Shell, Auto-Protect
RWA: Break Damage Limit, Magic Counter, Counter-Attack
With Agi of 255 and Auto-Haste you will get at least two turns with each
character before Valefor gets a kick in. Info about Valefor's attacks:
- 'swipe' deals 3700 damage
- Energy Ray deals about 1000 damage to all
- Energy Blast deals 50000 damage to all (cannot be halved in any way)
- Sonic Wings deals about 1200 damage
- this is amount of damage dealt to chrs with 255 Def and Mdef
As you can see, only danger lies in Energy Blast, which is only used when
Valefor's Ovedrive gauge charges to the max. Among other turns Valefor will be
using Energy Ray, 'swipe' and Sonic Wings, none of which are particularly
dangerous.
You'll also need to have high Accuracy, or else you'll keep missing Valefor
when physically attacking. Don't bother with magic, unless you have 255 Mag and
Doublecast. I suggest using only physical attacks.
Valefor's Overdrive gauge will fill up after you attack it for 8 times. On
first turn it gets after that, you'll be Energy Blasted. Unless your HP goes
well over 60000, you'll die. Okay, let's discuss a bit how you should fight.
First thing to be done is cast Auto-Life on all three chrs. Forget about Shell
and Protect, they're useless. Have Rikku Mix Trio of 9999 and use Pray to heal
all chrs when necessary. Then use Quick Hit ability to keep attacking Valefor,
thus allowing you to get even more hits in.
Once Valefor hits Overdrive, silently eat the punishment. As soon as you wake
up thanks to Auto-Life, recast it! Then simply repeat what you were previously
doing and Valefor goes down the potty.

a) Hellfire - STATT VS all chrs - std
b) Meteor Strike - NATT VS one chr - mgd + delays chr's next turn
c) 'Swipe' - CATT VS one chr - phd

18. Monster strategy:
[Dark Ifrit pic available at following URL:
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/dark_ifrit.jpg]
RAA: Auto-Haste, Auto-Shell, Auto-Protect, Auto-Phoenix
RWA: Break Damage Limit, Magic Counter
Here's what you absolutely need if you want to have a chance against Ifrit. You
don't need any status protection (for a change). You do need Auto-Haste in
order to keep up with delay effect of Meteor Strike. Your HP doesn't need to
exceed 9999. And lastly, high Agi, high Acc and about 50 Luck. Set Overdrive
mode to Comrade.
Let's talk a bit about Ifrit's attacks:
- Meteor Strike does about 22000 damage to non-Shelled chr and delays that
chr's next turn
- 'Swipe' does about 10000 damage to non-protected chr; it is only used as
counter
- Hellfire does 33000 of non-element damage to all and can't be halved
As battle starts, Protect everyone and then Shell. Auto-Life is not to be used
except before Hellfire... which is when you may just as easily summon an aeon
to take the shot. Have each chr use Quick Hit once, and as Ifrit will counter
them, each will have a fraction of HP missing. So have first chr whose turn
comes up, use Megalixir or Healing Water.
Ifrit annoyingly counters everything you throw at him. If you have Protect on,
you'll get his for about 5000 damage. You should always have Shell on as well,
else you'll get 20000 HP taken aways when Meteor Strike comes. On regular turns
Ifrit uses only Meteor Strike and 'Swipe' as a counter. Attack Ifrit with Quick
Hits. If chr falls, revive him with Full-Life. When Ifrit's bar is filled,
you'll see Hellfire on next turn. Auto-Life yourselves or summon an aeon
instead. One dead aeon later continue with strategy of each chr taking one
Quick Hit, then having one heal all members, again each chr takes one Quick Hit
etc.
Little girl has been found! Congratulations to Dark Ifrit.

In case of lack of Luck, I have two alternate strategies:
- You could try Doublecasting Flares or Ultimas at his ass. Will take longer,
but at least you don't need to have high Luck. You do, however, need high Magic
if you want to deal a good amount of damage.
- Blitz Ace and/or Attack Reels. Overdrive attacks do not miss, regardless of
Luck and Evade of the enemy. Once Tidus or Wakka used their Overdrives, Entrust
either one with Overdrive bars from fellow party members. Comrade Overdrive
mode will take care of Overdrive gauges filling up quickly so that it won't
take long before unleashing further Overdrives.

[Dark Ixion pic available at following URL:
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/dark_ixion.jpg]
RAA: Auto-Haste, Auto-Shell, Ribbon, Auto-Phoenix
RWA: Break Damage Limit, Magic Counter, Counter-Attack
Here's what you absolutely need if you want to have a chance against Ixion.
You'll need Sleepproof for first battle and Confuseproof for second. What two
battles? Well, you need to defeat Ixion twice before he's considered dead. You
do need Auto-Haste in order to keep up with delay effect of Thundaja. Your HP
doesn't need to exceed 9999. And lastly, high Agi, high Acc and about 80 Luck.
Set Overdrive mode to Comrade. If your Eva is enormous, Ixion's physical
attacks will never hit you and inflict some nasty status changes on you.
Let's talk a bit about Ixion's attacks:
- Aerospark does about 8000 damage to non-Protected chr and removes any
positive statuses on that chr; it is used only in first battle when Ixion's
Overdrive is charged
- 'Swipe a' does about 4800 damage to non-Protected chr; it is only used as
counter in first battle and it can incur Sleep along with Mental and Armor
Break
- 'Swipe b' does about 4800 damage to non-Protected chr; it is only used as
regular turn's move in second battle and it can incur Confuse along with Mental
and Armor Break
- Thundaja does about 5000 non-elemental damage to non-Shelled chr and delays
that chr's next turn
- Thor's Hammer does 12000 of non-element damage to all and can't be halved; it
adds Full Break to surviving chrs
As first battle starts, Protect everyone and then Shell. Auto-Life is not to be
used in this battle. Have each chr use Quick Hit once, and as Ixion will
counter them, each will have a fraction of HP missing. So have first chr whose
turn comes up, use Megalixir or Healing Water.
Ixion annoyingly counters everything you throw at him. If you have Protect on,
you'll get hit for about 4000 damage and Sleep, Armor and Mental Break. If you
pack high Evade, you'll be spared, tho'. On regular turns Ixion uses only
Thundaja and 'Swipe a' as a counter. Attack Ixion with Quick Hits. If chr
falls, revive him with Full-Life. When Ixion's bar is filled, you'll see
Aerospark. If you die, you die. Don't bother with Auto-Life, as it gets
removed, remember? One Aerospark later continue with strategy of each chr
taking one Quick Hit, then having one heal all members, again each chr takes
one Quick Hit etc.
First match time finished. 1:0 for Tidus.
In case of lack of Luck, I have two alternate strategies:
- You could try Doublecasting Flares or Ultimas at his ass. Will take longer,
but at least you don't need to have high Luck. You do, however, need high Magic
if you want to deal a good amount of damage.
- Blitz Ace and/or Attack Reels. Overdrive attacks do not miss, regardless of
Luck and Evade of the enemy. Once Tidus or Wakka used their Overdrives, Entrust
either one with Overdrive bars from fellow party members. Comrade Overdrive
mode will take care of Overdrive gauges filling up quickly so that it won't
take long before unleashing further Overdrives.
Now that big summoner is down, you need to spank the kid. He will randomly
appear in North Thunder Plains along with Ixion. Run into them and second
battle will issue. Note that you can run away from this one.
This battle has few differences. Ixion doesn't counter anymore, on regular
turns he uses 'Swipe b' (same as before, only instead of Sleep you get Confuse)
or Aerospark, and in Overdrive he uses Thor's Hammer. 'Swipe b' can easily be
avoided with high Agility, Auto-Life is still a waste (cos of Aerospark). Only
Auto-Life yourselves prior to Thor's Hammer. Thor's Hammer may likely kill some
of your chrs, but thanks to Auto-Life they'll be back before you know it. On
chrs that survived Thor's Hammer use Dispel immediately to remove Breaks he/she
received. All in all, I consider this battle easier than first one, as you
receive less attacks. Subdue Ixion with Quick Hits as usual by now.

Alternate strategy sent in by Fred K.:
Your three characters are Wakka, Yuna, and Auron. Wakka and Auron have the
Auto-phoenix ability. Have 99 Phoenix Downs. Whenever you attack and Ixion
counterattacks either Wakka or Auron will revive. You need about 20 Phoenix
Downs to win this battle. The first battle you don't have to worry about Thor's
Hammer. When Ixion's gauge is full, he will only use Aerospark, and can only
kill one character.
In second battle Ixion uses Thor's Hammer so when his gauge is nearly full use
Yuna and one of her aeons. When Ixion has used Thor's Hammer you can continue
the fight. If you didn't use one of the Aeons Ixion would wipe
out your entire party (can be rectified with Auto-Life).

18. Monster strategy:
[Dark Shiva pic available at following URL:
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/dark_shiva.jpg]
RAA: Auto-Haste, Auto-Protect, Deathproof, Berserkproof, Confuseproof, Ribbon
RWA: Break Damage Limit, Magic Counter, Counter-Attack
Here's what you absolutely need if you want to have a chance against Shiva. You
must get Deathproof and either Berserkproof or Confuseproof (I suggest
Confuseproof, for berserked chr will at least try to hit her). You need Auto-
Haste in order to keep up with Shiva's crazy Agility. Your HP doesn't need to
exceed 9999. And lastly, high Agi, high Acc and about 120 Luck. Set Overdrive
mode to Comrade.
Let's talk a bit about Shiva's attacks:
- 'Kick' does 6000 damage to non-Protected chr and removes any positive
statuses on that chr
- Heavenly Strike does about 10000 damage to non-Protected chr and carries
instant KO, Berserk and Confuse
- Diamond Dust does 85000 of non-element damage to all and can't be halved
- Finally, Shiva appears to have inherent ability of Quick Hit; you can easily
see so in CTB window in upper right corner; when she uses 'Kick' or Heavenly
Strike, see how fast she'll get next turn... after all of your chrs take one;
and this is at 255 Agi and Auto-Haste!
As battle starts, don't bother with casting protective statuses cos of Shiva's
'Kick', which has Dispel effect. Auto-Life is a waste to be used... cast it
only before Shiva's Diamond Dust, which is used when she hits Overdrive. Have
each chr use Quick Hits until Shiva gets an attack in. Heal or revive,
depending on attack she used and your protection against it, then continue with
Quick Hits. As Shiva's Overdrive gets full, eat Diamond Dust punishment. Cough
cough. When woken up thanks to Auto-Life, immediately have one or two chrs
Quick Pocket Megalixir or two. Fighting conditions restored, now kick Shiva
into oblivion.
In case of lack of Luck, I have two alternate strategies:
- You could try Doublecasting Flares or Ultimas at her ass. Will take longer,
but at least you don't need to have high Luck. You do, however, need high Magic
if you want to deal a good amount of damage.
- Blitz Ace and/or Attack Reels. Overdrive attacks do not miss, regardless of
Luck and Evade of the enemy. Once Tidus or Wakka used their Overdrives, Entrust
either one with Overdrive bars from fellow party members. Comrade Overdrive
mode will take care of Overdrive gauges filling up quickly so that it won't
take long before unleashing further Overdrives.

When you defeat Dark Shiva, a familiar scene occurs. Stream of Guado Guards.
Run all the way back to 'Macalania: Crevasse'. You'll need to fight two or
three times anyway, as those bozos are fast. Once on new screen, return to
entrance of Macalania Temple and guards are gone.

Note: From Dark Bahamut onward, it is strongly recommended to max out your
statistics. Concentrate on all of them, except HP (build it up to 9999), Magic
and MP.

chrs (except Auto-Life) - is only used when Bahamut's Overdrive is full

18. Monster strategy:
[Dark Bahamut pic available at following URL:
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/dark_bahamut.jpg]
RAA: Stoneproof, Slowproof, Auto-Haste, Ribbon, Auto-Protect
RWA: Break Damage Limit, Counter-Attack
S***! What's he doing here? I want my Sun Crest. Sorry, first you have to
defeat this 4 million HP jerk. In case you don't care for killer strategy
below, here's what you absolutely need if you want to have a chance against
Bahamut. You'll need Stoneproof (or Ribbon) to avoid being petrified, Slowproof
or Auto-Haste to avoid being slowed and you may or may not want to get Auto-
Protect. Your HP doesn't need to exceed 9999. And lastly, high Agi, high Acc
and about 100 Luck. Yes, Bahamut is one of dark aeons with insanely high Evade
(thanks solely to his Luck) and without your Luck you will do no good. Set
Overdrive mode to Comrade.
Damage Bahamut's attacks do are based on max stats of my chrs:
- Mega Flare 42000 damage to all *regardless* of stats
- Impulse 7000 damage to all
- 'Bash' 8000 damage to one, but it loves to get criticals; that's why I
suggested you may want to employ Auto-Protect
Battle is commencing! Yahoo! Start by using Quick Hits, and most importantly,
*keep count of how many times you attacked him!!!* After each fifth attack
Bahamut counters with Impulse. It inflicts Full Break, Slow and Petrify. This
Petrify shatters your chr regardless of HP. So wear that Stoneproof. You DO NOT
want to be short of a chr. Slow side-effect will be made useless by Slowproof,
or cast Haste on affected chrs. Remove Break effects with Dispel on affected
chr. There, bad effects of Impulse have been negated, proceed with another five
attacks on Bahamut until one of two things happen:
a) Bahamut gets regular attack without Overdrive gauge being full
In this case you'll see 'Bash'. If Bahamut gets a breaked character, revive
that chr, cos he's sure to get KO-ed. If Bahamut gets non-breaked chr, heal or
revive that chr. Protect status is good!
b) Bahamut gets regular attack with Overdrive gauge being full
Alert. Mega-Flare is imminent. If you pack less than 50000 HP, you *will*
either need to cast Auto-Life on your chrs or summon an aeon to take the shot
instead. Once the animation is finished, your chrs are back on their feet.
Auto-Life IS NOT removed by Mega-Flare!
We're back at beginning, so continue with attacks on Bahamut, taking note of
how many attacks you launched against him, to cast Auto-Life prior to Mega-
Flare and to use Dispel on Break-ed chrs.
In case of lack of Luck, I have two alternate strategies:
- You could try Doublecasting Flares or Ultimas at his ass. Will take longer,
but at least you don't need to have high Luck. You do, however, need high Magic
if you want to deal a good amount of damage.
- Blitz Ace and/or Attack Reels. Overdrive attacks do not miss, regardless of
Luck and Evade of the enemy. Once Tidus or Wakka used their Overdrives, Entrust
either one with Overdrive bars from fellow party members. Comrade Overdrive
mode will take care of Overdrive gauges filling up quickly so that it won't
take long before unleashing further Overdrives.
KILLER STRATEGY!!! All you need is Auto-Life White Magic, Sentinel Special and
a weapon with Counter-Attack ability for Sentinel character (if you have
Sentinel and Counter-Attack weapons for all three, that's great). What do you
do? Simply use Sentinel for all of the battle. Bahamut's regular turn is
'Bash'. One of Sentinel chrs will run in, take the damage and then counter with
a physical attack immediately. The great thing about it is *that it doesn't
count to Bahamut's Impulse counter*, ie you can deal damage to Bahamut in this
way 30 times or more, and you still won't see any Impulses! The only danger you
have left is Mega-Flare. Nothing quick Auto-Life couldn't solve (or 45000 HP,
if you have that much - Mega Flare deals about 42000 damage to all chrs with
whatever stats they have). You could also summon an Aeon to take the Flare.

18. Monster strategy:
[Dark Yojimbo pic available at following URL:
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/dark_yojimbo.jpg]
RAA: Stoneproof, Slowproof, Auto-Haste, Ribbon, Auto-Protect
RWA: Break Damage Limit, Counter-Attack, First Strike
Let's show this overgrown samurai how one should deal with it. Here's what you
absolutely need if you want to have a chance against Yojimbo (you have to fight
him 5 times before he is gone for good!). You'll need Stoneproof (or Ribbon) to
avoid being petrified, Slowproof or Auto-Haste to avoid being slowed and you
may or may not want to get Auto-Protect. Your HP doesn't need to exceed 9999.
Yojimbo is a bit better at evading as he has slightly higher Luck. Set
Overdrive mode to Comrade.
Let's discuss Yojimbo's attacks a bit:
- Wakizashi strikes all, and does about 24000 damage at max stats
- Daigoro strikes one chr for about 7000 damage, inflicts Poison and Petrify
(thankfully chr doesn't shatter if damage incurred is lower than current HP)
- Kozuka strikes one chr for about 6000 damage and also does Slow and Full
Break
- Zanmato which is only used on Overdrive, strikes all chrs and means Game
Over, as it removes Auto-Life as well; only way to evade it is having an aeon
take the place
Prior to first battle equip all three battling chrs with First Strike custom
weapons. As battle commences in the very back of the cavern Yojimbo will ambush
you 100% of the time. In 33% cases he may use Wakizashi on his first turn. With
more than 25000 HP and Auto-Protect in place (Wakizashi may still score
critical strike), you'll be just fine. If struck by Daigoro, you may go
'Aaaargh!' if chr attacked gets shattered. Equip Stoneproof armors to avoid
that. Else cure Poison status you may also receive from same attack. If Kozuka-
ed, use Dispel to remove Breaks. But as we have First Strike, do following:
have Rikku Mix Ultra NulAll first. Don't go 'Huh? Why do I need this?0... if
you couple this with Auto-Protect armors you equipped prior to battle together
with 5x Cheer effect Ultra NulAll adds, your defence will be high enough to
survive Yojimbo's Wakizashi. As general rule by now, start attacking with Quick
Hits. Heal after each of Yojimbo's attacks! If you're unable to hit him because
of low Luck, resort to Doublecasting Flares and Ultimas. Yojimbo doesn't
counter anything, so you're safe in this field. Beware of Yojimbo's Overdrive -
summon aeon to take Zanmato as you cannot survive it, not even with Auto-Life.
Thankfully he packs only 1600000 HP - 17 hits each at 99999 and he's a goner.
After you defeat him for first time, his summoner will flee toward entrance of
the cavern. Go into pursuit and on the way you will engage in four more
battles. You *will* have to make a slight detour on the way - that is, check
all the rooms on the way to cavern's exit. Summoner 'hid' himself into one of
those rooms. Repeat the strategy given above and you shall emerge victorious.
Additional strategy in case you can't hit often with physical attacks:
- Blitz Ace and/or Attack Reels. Overdrive attacks do not miss, regardless of
Luck and Evade of the enemy. Once Tidus or Wakka used their Overdrives, Entrust
either one with Overdrive bars from fellow party members. Comrade Overdrive
mode will take care of Overdrive gauges filling up quickly so that it won't
take long before unleashing further Overdrives.

TOP STRATEGIC TIP:
As Yojimbo needs to be defeated five times in order to be legitimately dead,
you can try this: Defeat him four and four times only, then return to back of
the cavern and use save sphere found there to save your game, then reset. Load
lastly saved game, proceed in the extreme back of the cavern and here we go
again. Beat Yojimbo four times, load, reset, rinse and repeat. This is the
fastest and somewhat 80% reliable way of getting 4-slotted Ribbon armors, if
you're a lucky bastard and Yojimbo drops one. As an added bonus you will
receive either Dark Matters or Master Spheres after battle.

TOP STRATEGIC TIP:
Next aeons to be buried are Magus Sisters. You may have already tried to fight
them before, only to be mercilessly slaughtered by Delta Attack (like I did
countless times). One thing I need to mention: Magus Sisters have painfully
high Evade and enormous Luck to boost that. Even with 200 Luck and 255 Acc some
of my attacks didn't connect with Mindy. Thankfully, there is a way to fight
them one by one! First Sandy, then Mindy, and lastly Cindy. What do you need to
do?
[Dark Magus Sisters pic available at following URL:
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/dark_magus.jpg]
Head to Mushroom Rock Road where there are a child and a woman talking. Walk
past them and scene will occur. When given control of Tidus again, *run* to the
exit on your left!!! Don't let them catch you, or you will face them in battle,
all three with full Overdrives and Cindy releasing Delta Attack on her turn.
There's no way in hell to survive that (except aeon sacrificing itself).
Once on next screen, use the platform. When on the top, go up. Minigame will
issue, cleverly called 'Getting Away'. Your goal is to reach the end of this
path before the summoners running after you have a chance to capture you.
Longer you'll get, better your odds in upcoming battle. Screen will flash to
help you decipher how close pursuers are:
- Not flashing -> you're safe
- Yellow flash -> pursuers are getting close
- Red flash -> capture imminent
It may sound easy, but it's quite difficult, especially cos of dumb camera that
has new angles (specifically for this minigame, I presume). You should at least
try to make it past half of the path, at which point you lose one pursuer -
Cindy. If you get caught from now on, you'll have to fight only Sandy and
Mindy. 2 aeons is still bad, but at least you won't see Delta Attack. If you're
able to make it all the way to the second platform at end of the path,
congratulate yourself. You made it! You may now fight sisters one by one,
starting with Sandy. What is great about my strategy for these three is... you
won't need Ribbon at all!

18. Monster strategy:
RAA: Stoneproof, Auto-Haste, Ribbon, Auto-Protect, Auto-Shell, Auto-Med
RWA: Break Damage Limit, Counter-Attack, First Strike
Here's what you absolutely need if you want to have a chance against Sandy.
You'll need Stoneproof (or Ribbon) to avoid being petrified. Your HP doesn't
need to exceed 9999 (in which case you'll need Auto-Protect). To negate Mega-
Graviton's nasty side effects, you will need either Ribbon for complete
protection or at least Sleepproof. Set Overdrive mode to Comrade.
Let's discuss Sandy's attacks a bit:
- Razzia deals about 97000 damage to one and removes Auto-Life; survive it only
with 99999 HP and Auto-Protect
- 'Slash' will smoke off about 12000 HP of one chr and petrify that chr, unless
Stoneproofed; if damage done is greater than current HP, chr is lost
- Mega-Graviton is used when Sandy's Ov. bar is full; you *must* have your HP
over half or else you'll be killed, as damage done is based on MAX HP; you will
also receive all sorts of bad stuff, Doom and Sleep being the worst; have at
least Sleepproof in your armor
- Delta Attack ain't used, as there's only one sis to deal with
As battle starts (may get ambushed), first thing to do is Protect yourselves.
Don't bother with Auto-Life except in one condition I'll mention later. Because
of Stoneproof you won't lose any chrs. If Razzia-ed, revive the chr with Full-
Life magic in case MAX HP exceeds 9999! Use Phoenix items in case MAX HP is
9999. Use Quick Hits or Doublecasted Flares and Ultimas if you can't hit Sandy
efficiently. When her Ov. bar gets full, she'll use Mega-Graviton on her next
turn, so prepare accordingly. Make sure your HP is below 33% MAX HP (Doublecast
Demis on yourself or use Dark Matter on yourself, just make sure you knock
everyone's health under that limit) or 20% MAX HP (this is in case you have
Auto-Shell armor). Cast Auto-Life on all three. If you still have available
turns, attack her. Once Mega-Graviton strikes, everyone dies, but will then be
revived thanks to Auto-Life. Sandy may still get a turn before your first chr
is able to act, but Sandy's attacks only target one, so this is the most you'll
lose.
Final result? One chr dead, two chrs alive and ready to act, *no* bad statuses
whatsoever, Sandy waiting for her input. [This document copyrighted to Split
Infinity. In case writer's name at the top isn't mine, the guide is ripped.
Report to lifearmor@hotmail.com.] First chr that gets to act revives fallen
one, the other Quick Pockets few Megalixirs and here we go. Fighting conditions
restored to maximum and it's ass kicking time.
Additional strategy in case you can't hit often with physical attacks:

18. Monster strategy:
RAA: Deathproof, Auto-Haste, Ribbon, Auto-Protect, Auto-Shell
RWA: Break Damage Limit, First Strike
Here's what you absolutely need if you want to have a chance against Mindy.
You'll need Deathproof to avoid being KO-ed cos of Passado. Your HP doesn't
need to exceed 9999. To negate Mega-Graviton's nasty side effects, you will
need either Ribbon for complete protection or at least Sleepproof. Set
Overdrive mode to Comrade.
Let's discuss Mindy's attacks a bit:
- Passado does about 12000 damage to one and incurs KO; unless Deathproofed,
chr attacked is KO-ed; damage done cannot be halved in any way
- Calamity incurs Full Break, Curse, Silence, Darkness and Poison; all of this
is manageable, but cure *Poison* first, then Breaks (with Dispel, remember?);
luckily it targets only one chr
- Mega-Graviton is used when Mindy's Ov. bar is full; you *must* have your HP
over half or else you'll be killed, as damage done is based on MAX HP; you will
also receive all sorts of bad stuff, Doom and Sleep being the worst; have at
least Sleepproof in your armor
- Delta Attack ain't used, as there's only one sis to deal with
As battle starts (may get ambushed), first thing to do is... nothing. Don't
bother with Auto-Life except in one condition I'll mention later. Because of
Deathproof you won't lose any chrs, unless the damage Passado is doing exceeds
MAX HP of chr that got attacked. Revive fallen Passado-ed chrs with Full-Life
magic in case MAX HP exceeds 9999! Use Phoenix items in case MAX HP is 9999.
Use Quick Hits or Doublecasted Flares and Ultimas if you can't hit Mindy
efficiently. When her Ov. bar gets full, she'll use Mega-Graviton on her next
turn, so prepare accordingly. Make sure your HP is below 33% MAX HP (Doublecast
Demis on yourself or use Dark Matter on yourself, just make sure you knock
everyone's health under that limit) or 20% MAX HP (this is in case you have
Auto-Shell armor). Cast Auto-Life on all three. If you still have available
turns, attack her. Once Mega-Graviton strikes, everyone dies, but will then be
revived thanks to Auto-Life. Mindy may still get a turn before your first chr
is able to act, but Mindy's attacks only target one, so this is the most you'll
lose.
Final result? One chr dead (or none, if she used Calamity), two (or three) chrs
alive and ready to act, *no* bad statuses whatsoever (except if Calamity was
used), Mindy waiting for her input. First chr that gets to act revives fallen
one (or heals the Calamity-ed chr of bad statuses), the other Quick Pockets few
Megalixirs and here we go. Fighting conditions restored to maximum and it's ass
kicking time.
Additional strategy in case you can't hit often with physical attacks:
- Blitz Ace and/or Attack Reels. Overdrive attacks do not miss, regardless of
Luck and Evade of the enemy. Once Tidus or Wakka used their Overdrives, Entrust
either one with Overdrive bars from fellow party members. Comrade Overdrive
mode will take care of Overdrive gauges filling up quickly so that it won't
take long before unleashing further Overdrives.

18. Monster strategy:
RAA: Auto-Haste, Ribbon, Auto-Protect, Auto-Shell
RWA: Break Damage Limit, Counter-Attack, First Strike
Here's what you absolutely need if you want to have a chance against Cindy.
Your HP doesn't need to exceed 9999 (in which case you'll need Auto-Protect).
To negate Mega-Graviton's nasty side effects, you will need either Ribbon for
complete protection or at least Sleepproof. Set Overdrive mode to Comrade.
Let's discuss Cindy's attacks a bit:
- 'Bash' deals about 12000 damage to one and removes *any* positive statuses,
Auto-Life included; survive it with Auto-Protect
- Camisade strikes one chr for about 60000 damage and has Osmose effect; halve
the damage with Protect
- Mega-Graviton is used when Cindy's Ov. bar is full; you *must* have your HP
over half or else you'll be killed, as damage done is based on MAX HP; you will
also receive all sorts of bad stuff, Doom and Sleep being the worst; have at
least Sleepproof in your armor
- Delta Attack ain't used, as there's only one sis to deal with
As battle starts (may get ambushed), don't bother with positive statuses except
those you have put in your armor. Also don't bother with Auto-Life except in
one condition I'll mention later. If Camisade-d, revive the chr with Full-Life
magic in case MAX HP exceeds 9999! Use Phoenix items in case MAX HP is 9999.
Use Quick Hits or Doublecasted Flares and Ultimas if you can't hit Cindy
efficiently. When her Ov. bar gets full, she'll use Mega-Graviton on her next
turn, so prepare accordingly. Make sure your HP is below 33% MAX HP (Doublecast
Demis on yourself or use Dark Matter on yourself, just make sure you knock
everyone's health under that limit) or 20% MAX HP (this is in case you have
Auto-Shell armor). Cast Auto-Life on all three. If you still have available
turns, attack her. Once Mega-Graviton strikes, everyone dies, but will then be
revived thanks to Auto-Life. Cindy may still get a turn before your first chr
is able to act, but Cindy's attacks only target one, so this is the most you'll
lose.
Final result? One chr dead, two chrs alive and ready to act, *no* bad statuses
whatsoever, Cindy waiting for her input. First chr that gets to act revives
fallen one, the other Quick Pockets few Megalixirs and here we go. Fighting
conditions restored to maximum and it's ass kicking time.
Additional strategy in case you can't hit often with physical attacks:
- Blitz Ace and/or Attack Reels. Overdrive attacks do not miss, regardless of
Luck and Evade of the enemy. Once Tidus or Wakka used their Overdrives, Entrust
either one with Overdrive bars from fellow party members. Comrade Overdrive

d) Oblivion - STATT VS all chrs - 16 consecutive hits to all - std + Osmose
effect - is only used when Anima's Overdrive is full - removes all positive
statuses from your chrs (except Auto-Life)

18. Monster strategy:
[Dark Anima pic available at following URL:
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/dark_anima.jpg]
RAA: Stoneproof, Auto-Haste, Ribbon, Auto-Shell
RWA: Break Damage Limit, Counter-Attack, First Strike
Here's what you absolutely need if you want to have a chance against Anima.
Your HP doesn't need to exceed 9999. To negate Mega-Graviton's nasty side
effects, you will need either Ribbon for complete protection or at least
Sleepproof. You also need Stoneproof (or Ribbon) to avoid being petrified. Set
Overdrive mode to Comrade.
Let's discuss Anima's attacks a bit:
- Pain will 100% guaranteed KO one chr, nuffin you can do about that
- 'Bash' deals about 4000 damage to one chr; its most dangerous side effect is
Petrify, other three are manageable; if not Stoneproofed, chr is shattered
regardless of HP; can be halved with Protect
- Mega-Graviton is used on regular turns; you *must* have your HP over half or
else you'll be killed, as damage done is based on MAX HP; you will also receive
all sorts of bad stuff, Doom and Sleep being the worst; have at least
Sleepproof in your armor; Auto-Shell will reduce damage done
- Oblivion deals about 85000 damage to all, removes all positive statuses (sans
Auto-Life) and has Osmose effect
As battle starts (may get ambushed), don't bother with positive statuses except
those you have put in your armor. Don't bother with Auto-Life except in one
condition mentioned later. If Pain-ed, revive the chr with Full-Life magic in
case MAX HP exceeds 9999! Use Phoenix items in case MAX HP is 9999. Use Quick
Hits. If you can't hit Anima, you're screwed unless your Overdrives are
powerful. What about magic? Anima is immune to all magic. When her Ov. bar gets
full, she'll use Oblivion on her next turn, so prepare like this: summon aeon
to take the cake, but most likely you will run out of aeons in case you aren't
able to do at least 1000000 damage to it between each Oblivion. You stand a
chance against Oblivion only in following cases: you have more than 93000 HP
*or* your Agi is 255, you have Auto-Haste in the armor and you know Auto-Life.
In first case resume the fighting normally. In second case you'll be out of MP
for some Quick Pockets, but you *will* have a chr available to pull out
Megalixir by Item command fast enough for others to have MP available for Quick
Pockets. Then resume the fighting normally with Quick Hits or Overdrives.
Additional strategy in case you can't hit often with physical attacks:
- Blitz Ace and/or Attack Reels. Overdrive attacks do not miss, regardless of
Luck and Evade of the enemy. Once Tidus or Wakka used their Overdrives, Entrust
either one with Overdrive bars from fellow party members. Comrade Overdrive
mode will take care of Overdrive gauges filling up quickly so that it won't

PENANCE BOSS STRATEGIES
***********************

[Penance pic available at following URL:
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/penance_bastard.jpg]

Kudos to Anothergamer for this extremely useful tip. There's one ability called
Cheer. It is of utmost importance against Penance. By using Cheer five times
from start of the battle not only does it increase party's Str, but it also
increases party's Def, regardless of the fact that your chrs already have 255
Def. With this information whole new area of possibilities is opened. And also
some new discoveries were made.
A character at 255 Def and 5x Cheered takes about 7500-8000 damage from
Obliteration and 9000-9800 damage from Immolation. Arm's physical attacks,
sadly, may still kill you (unless defending), as they deal over 10000 damage.
But with help of my detailed strategy above, you shouldn't worry about being
killed by arms, as you'll never see an attack from them.
Additionally this enables your chrs to drop Break HP Limit ability from armor
and integrate something else of your choice.
More... FFX gameplay board gave another big tip on this battle. In last empty
slot in your armor integrate Def+20% armor ability. Surprisingly enough, it
still adds defence value, even though your defence is already maxed!

A - BOSS PREPARATIONS

Presenting the easiest and the ultimate strategy you've ever seen on Penance.
No longer does one need to suffer cos of Penance wiping the floor with his/her
party... No, this time you *will* wipe the floor with his ass.
a) For starters let's talk about what your stats should be:
- HP of 9999
- MP doesn't matter
- Str and Def at 255
- Mag doesn't matter
- Mdef at 255 (but for my strategy it doesn't matter)
- Agi and Acc at 255
- Luck at about 150 (trust me, you need high luck, else you'll hardly hit it)
- Eva doesn't matter (even at 255 Luck and 255 Eva I still got hit)
b) Next, what should your weapons be:
- Celestial weapons for every character you'll be using
- I recommend using weapons that are easiest to power up fully: Yuna, Auron and
Rikku
c) Next, what should your armor contain:
For this strategy -> Auto-Protect, Auto-Haste, Auto-Potion, Def+20%
d) Next, what abilities you must have:
- Quick Hit, Quick Pockets, Dispel, Use
e) Lastly, what items you will need:
- Potion, Hi-Potion, X-Potion, Three Stars, Purifying Salt

Once you have all that, talk to Cid on airship. Choose 'List' and Penance is
now available as a destination. Pick it, watch the scene and the easiest (or
most boring IMO) battle begins.
Rule 1: You want to have Auto-Protect on, as Penance's attacks are physicals.
Rule 2: About dying... you'll never even have to use any reviving at all. This
strat is 100% dying free.
Rule 3: Never let any of boss' parts get an attack in with any of your
characters being under Break statuses. With this strategy all attacks you'll
ever see are Obliteration and Immolation. Only rule to oblige by is to use
Dispel immediately after Penance's Immolation.
Rule 4: Only attack Penance if both arms are gone. Always give priority to
destroying the arms and not letting them get an attack in.

B - BOSS MOVES OVERVIEW

- Penance will for first half of battle only use Obliteration (11000 of
physical damage to all and Slow effect, which is negated cos of Auto-Haste),
regardless of fact if he has zero, one or both arms; once 25% of his HP is
knocked off, Penance loses lower half of body and also loses Auto-Protect
status
- in second part Penance switches to Immolation (15000 of physical damage to
one with Armor and Mental Breaks); in case both arms are present, it may use
Judgment Day (99999 damage to all, doesn't remove Auto-Life)
- Right Arm uses Mighty Guard (Dispel Penance first!), Calamity (use Dispel on
chr affected ASAP) or Bash (19000 of physical damage to one, Petrify effect)
- Left Arm uses Mega-Graviton (takes off 75% of MAX HP (or 37,5% if under
Shell)), and some nasty status side effects), Slowga (negated by Auto-Haste) or
'Bash' (18000 of physical damage to one, removes *any* positive status on
character attacked, unless integrated in his/her armor)
Note: Damage written is damage done to Protected and Shelled characters.

C - RECOMMENDED CHARACTERS TO BE USED

Rikku (Trio of 9999), any of the guys (all of their celestial weapons have
either Counter-Attack or Evade&Counter - useful ability for second part of
battle)

D - FIRST HALF BATTLE STRATEGY

These are the only commands you'll ever use in this battle: Cheer x5, Mix 1x,
Quick Pockets 1x, Quick Hit most of the time and occassionally Dispel. I used
Rikku, Tidus and Yuna, therefore what you're about to read is how the battle
went using these three characters.
As the battle starts, you will have 6 (most likely) or 7 (rarely) turns before
Penance gets first attack in.
Use Quick Hit (QH from now on) against Left Arm (LA from now on) until it dies.
Then use three QH against RA until Penance uses Obliteration (OBL from now on).
Don't waste time healing yet! You will survive OBL, as it will deal about 9000
damage to all. QH vs RA three more times until it dies - you'll kill it just
before its turn. 5 turns still left before second OBL. Now let's take care of
business for these five turns. Tidus and Yuna use Cheer, Rikku Mixes Trio of
9999, either Tidus and Yuna Quick Pocket Mega-Potion, and finally third Cheer
before second OBL.
It is possible you'll get in another turn cos of previous quickly pocketed
Mega-Potion - use it for Cheer. OBL strikes for second time. This time you chrs
will automatically heal themselves to full thanks to Auto-Potion and Trio
combination. What else is left to be done? Use Cheer one or two more times (5
times is max - you can continue on using it, but it's useless, as it doesn't
add anymore defence value), then Use Three Stars (nullifies need for MP) and
from now on all you have to do in first part of battle is using Quick Hits and
killing off arms as soon as they appear.
If you followed my advice closely, you'll see that you'll never have both arms
present in battle. This is to ensure that Penance will never have favorable
conditions in second part of battle to be able to use Judgement Day. In no more
than 12 OBL lower part of Penance will fall off.

BTW, here's a brief info on damage you'll receive with 255 Def, Auto-Protected,
5x Cheered and Def+20% armor abilitied chr:
Immolation deals from 8000 to 8500 damage to one (in addition to reducing MP to
zero). Arm strikes for 9000 damage (just an useful piece of info, you'll never
see arm attack anyway). Obliteration does 5900 damage to all.

E - SECOND HALF BATTLE STRATEGY

We arrive in second halftime. First character that gets to act Uses Purifying
Salt on Penance to dispel his Haste status. Main thing is not to worry of
getting killed by Immolation, simply cos you can't get killed by it. Keep using
same strategy as you did for first part of battle except with one minor
difference. You'll need to cast Dispel on chr that gets Immolated to remove
Armor and Mental Breaks. Anything else is still the same. Characters will heal
themselves thanks to Auto-Potion, Quick Hitting right targets and dispeling is
*all* you'll have to do.
Good-DIE, Penance!:)

You simply cannot fail with this strategy. Once again this couldn't have been
possible if Anothergamer didn't share the info on usefulness of Cheer.

There. This is everything I compiled together about Penance. I'm absolutely
sure it'll bring you victory without a single character dying once (in case you
won't be playing roulettes with Immolation, anyway:)).

*************************
STRATEGY FOR BHPL PLAYERS
*************************

A - BOSS PREPARATIONS

a) For starters let's talk about what your stats should be:
- HP of at least 20000 (it is important you have at least that much HP for this
strategy)
Note: Personally I had 52000 HP for every chr I used, I had those HP from a
previous battle, whose strategy you may read close to this one. I didn't need
to heal once personally during whole battle, Auto-Potion took care of it.
- MP doesn't matter:)
- Str and Def at 255
- Mag doesn't matter
- Mdef at 255 (but for my strategy it doesn't matter)
- Agi and Acc at 255
- Luck at about 150 (trust me, you need high luck, else you'll hardly hit it)
- Eva doesn't matter (even at 255 Luck and 255 Eva I still got hit)
b) Next, what should your weapons be:
- three custom made weapons for three starting characters, those weapons
consisting of First Strike and Break Damage Limit abilities
- Celestial weapons for every character you'll be using
- I recommend using weapons that are easiest to power up fully: Yuna, Auron and
Rikku
c) Next, what should your armor contain:
For this strategy -> Auto-Protect, Auto-Haste, Break HP Limit, Auto-Potion
d) Next, what abilities you must have:
- Quick Hit, Quick Pockets, Dispel, Use
e) Lastly, what items you will need:
- Potion, Hi-Potion, X-Potion, Three Stars, Megalixir, Purifying Salt

Once you have all that, talk to Cid on airship. Choose 'List' and Penance is
now available as a destination. Pick it, watch the scene and the easiest (or
most boring IMO) battle begins.
Rule 1: You want to have Auto-Protect on, as Penance's attacks are physicals.
Rule 2: Never use Auto-Life or Auto-Phoenix armor ability... Hah, you'll never
even have to use any reviving at all. This strat is 100% dying free.
Rule 3: Never let any of boss' parts get an attack in with any of your
characters being under Break statuses. With this strategy all attacks you'll
ever see are Obliteration and Immolation. Only rule to oblige by is to use
Dispel immediately after Penance's Immolation.
Rule 4: First you'll need to get rid of Left Arm ASAP.
Rule 5: Only attack Penance if both arms are gone. Always give priority to
destroying the arms and not letting them get an attack in.
Rule 6: When (mostly *if* it manages) Right Arm casts Mighty Guard, Dispel
Penance *first*. Regen effect Mighty Guard carries may restore up to 200000 HP
to Penance!
Rule 7: Equip First Strike weapons prior to battle. At 255 Str and sufficient
Luck these weapons can deal up to 99999 damage to both arms. Don't attack the
body with those... you'll only tear off 25000 or so.

B - RECOMMENDED CHARACTERS TO BE USED

Rikku (Trio of 9999), any of the guys (all of their celestial weapons have
either Counter-Attack or Evade&Counter - useful ability for second part of
battle)

C - FIRST HALF BATTLE STRATEGY

First step to assured victory is to never let any of Penance's arms to get an
attack. In this strategy you'll never see one except for Penance's.
I used Rikku, Tidus and Yuna, therefore what you're about to read is how the
battle went using these three characters.
As the battle starts, check the CTB bar. Thanks to First Strike custom weapons
you will have 9 turns (as you may know, the game counts turns as if every chr
or fiend would choose Attack command next) before Penance gets first attack in.
This is the big difference from a previous strategy - more turns available
before Penance can even act. Tidus, Yuna and Rikku all had 3 turns (starting
with Tidus).
Use Quick Hit (QH from now on) two times against Left Arm (LA from now on). 7
turns left. Rikku is up next. Mix Trio of 9999 now! 5 turns left. Rikku'll get
next turn right before first Penance's. Use QH four more times (2x Tidus and 2x
Yuna) until LA is gone. This will get you still three more turns (each of those
being QH) before first Penance's. QH Right Arm (RA from now on) three times.
Penance uses Obliteration (OBL from now on). All chrs lose 11000 HP. If this
brings them in yellow HP, Auto-Potion will kick in - Potion will be used and
will restore 9999 damage to one (thanks to Trio we mixed before), raising
his/her HP back into white range. Note that healing for the whole fight will
mostly be taken care of by Auto-Potion. You yourself may need to heal only in
following two situations:
-> Danger 1: Any of your characters has 11500 or less HP before next OBL. Last
chr that gets to act before Penance, Quick Pockets (QP from now on) Mega-
Potion.
-> Danger 2: In second part of battle if any of your chrs has 16000 or less HP
before next Immolation. Last and second-to-last chr that get to act before
Penance, QP X-Potion or Mega-Potion.
Okay, first OBL is away and Penance is without LA. You now have three turns
available before first RA's. Use QH three times against RA and it's gone. Three
turns left before second Penance's. Tidus now Uses Three Stars. Yuna and Rikku
switch to celestial weapons (in that order). Yuna, Rikku and Tidus will still
get a turn before Penance. Yuna and Rikku use QH, and Tidus switches to
Caladbolg (in case one chr packs less than 11500 HP, Quick Pocket Mega-Potion
first!). Next is second OBL. Don't worry yet, as Auto-Potion will take care of
negating the damage. Regardless of Tidus' previous input, he will get first
turn after second OBL. Right now LA will regenerate.
Check CTB bar. You have whole 9 moves before third OBL. And you're more or less
set as well!
Use QH against LA six times to re-kill it. As soon as that is done, RA
regenerates. Three turns left before third OBL and ten turns before RA's move
(according to CTB bar). QH vs RA three times, OBL is used. With my 50000+ HP
this OBL was first that caused my chrs to use Auto-Potion. Check CTB bar again.
Still nine attacks left before RA gets a move. QH vs RA three times, RA dies.
Six attacks left before fourth OBL. Use all of these to launch QH vs Penance.
Right before fourth OBL LA will regenerate, then follows OBL.
Nine turns before both Penance's and LA's next move. More than enough. QH vs LA
six times and it's killed. RA regenerates. Three turns left before Penance's
turn and nine turns before RA's. QH vs RA three times. Fifth OBL. QK vs RA
three more times to kill it again...
Basically it's now like this: As you don't need to heal (except in two cases
mentioned a little bit above), all of your job is Using QH against either arm
as soon as it reappears. Once the arm is disposed off, QH Penance himself until
the other arm regenerates. QH that arm until it re-dies, QH Penance, the other
arm regenerates... ad infinitum. I guarantee you'll never see any of arms
attack. Only thing to remember is that you need to throw a look at HP just
before OBL. If HP of one chr is 11500 or less, QP Mega-Potion. Continue to use
this strategy until 3000000 of Penance's HP are knocked off, at which point...
Note: For my strategy I saw 11 Obliterations before lower half fell off.

D - SECOND HALF BATTLE STRATEGY

we arrive in second halftime. If my strategy was successful for you, Rikku will
have just a turn left before Penance's next turn, which will be Immolation (IMM
from now on). Have her QP Mega-Potion. Another turn available! LA regenerates.
On Rikku's turn (last before Penance's) use Purifying Salt on Penance. Why?
He's in Haste mode now (see CTB bar?), so we need to dispel it. Purifying Salt
will take care of that, as well as dealing some damage to him. First IMM. One
chr takes 15000 damage and Auto-Potions him/herself. First turn any character
gets now he/she uses Dispel on chr that got IMM-ed (in my case Tidus was first
one available).
Seven turns left before LA's turn. It'll get a bit tricky now, but don't worry,
I have it covered. QH vs LA three times. RA regenerates. Don't panic, we'll
kill both of them soon enough. QH vs LA three more times. It's gone. Two turns
left before second IMM and eight turns left before RA's. Tidus now uses
Sentinel! Yep, Sentinel can intercept IMM. Tidus will in this case get 75% less
damage, counter-attack and heal himself for 2500 HP more than IMM dealt damage
to him. So, now we even start gaining health.:) QH vs RA once. Second IMM. Six
turns left before RA's. First chr uses Dispel on Tidus (Yuna in my case). Now
QH RA 5 more times. You'll kill it just before its turn. Phew. Three turns left
before Penance's. QH vs Penance two times, Sentinel with Tidus. Third IMM.
Tidus takes the cake, counters and heals for +2500 HP. LA regenerates. Six
turns before Penance's. Yuna uses Dispel now. Use QH vs RA four times. Three
turns left before fourth IMM. Tidus, Rikku and Yuna in that order. Tidus uses
Sentinel, and Rikku and Yuna QH vs LA two more times to kill it. Fourth IMM.
You know what happens already. Six turns before fifth IMM. RA regenerates.
Tidus uses Dispel on himself. Six QH vs RA and it dies. Two turns left before
Penance's. Tidus and Yuna are the ones still available. Tidus uses Sentinel,
Yuna QH vs Penance once. Fifth IMM. Six turns left before sixth IMM. Rikku uses
Dispel on Tidus, Yuna QH vs Penance once. And so on...

The above is 100% sure way you'll never die, but also slow. You may want to
employ different strategy for this battle as outlined below.

The battle starts with Rikku and two guys. In first half hack away as outlined
above in part D. When in second half of battle, switch Rikku out for a third
guy, but only after 'Purifying Salt phase'.
Strategy is pretty much the same, except that you don't use Sentinel as
character attacked will counter anyway. Also damage dealt will be 15000, so you
may need to issue a QP-ed Mega-Potion or Megalixir (in case QP-ing is done by
lastly added guy). Don't forget to Use Twin Stars on last guy as well to
nullify need for MP.
This is a bit faster way, as QP are fast and reliable soruce of restoring HP.
Only bit more time consuming action will be Dispel you'll need to use after
each IMM immediately.

*****************************************************************************

Justaplayer, a fellow gamer from FFX gameplay board, has allowed me to use the
info he wrote down about beating Penance with base luck.

... I know this is not much of a big deal, but it might prove useful for those
who would like to try to avoid the Greater Sphere battles and the Earth Eater
battles, although there is still the Maelspike bribing way, but you need to get
Fortune Spheres for the first activation.
First, it is possible to defeat the dark aeons this way. As you know, there is
no problem with the first four, and as long as you have 255 Accuracy you can
handle Dark Anima and Dark Bahamut, as long as Dark Magus Sisters because Cindy
has low luck and evasion stats. The same goes to Dark Yojimbo, because four
Wakka's Reels should kill him. But I'm sure you knew all that already, it is
nothing new.
What you might not know is that via this method of overusing Tidus' Blitz Ace
and Wakka's Attack Reels you can defeat Penance too. Well, let's take you have
Auto-Potion, Auto-Haste, Def+20% and Auto-Protect. Also, you use Cheer five
times, and Trio of 9999. That's what the strategy states. From there on, by
just don't letting the arms attacks via Quick Hits you defeat Penance.
But what if you don't have enough luck and therefore you can't hit the arms?
Then this is the solution: one must use just Rikku, Wakka, and Tidus for this
battle. Have in mind that this is how I did it the other day, so it's proven it
can work.
Wakka's Attack Reels hit an arm for 46000 damage or such, with 255 Strength.
that makes a total of about 200000 on average if both arms are present and
300000 on average if only one is. Tidus' Blitz Ace makes eight hits of 12000
damage more or less and the final one of 99999. In the end this makes about
200000.
Arms have 500000 HP, hardly beatable with just one Blitz Ace and one Attack
Reels, which will be our goal. The way to surely do it is by increasing Tidus
damage to 300000, which can be done via one of Rikkus overdrives, which causes
every hit to be a critical hit. This is Miracle Drink.
Secondly, overdrives must be in Comrade mode, and we must get sure that each
Penance attack will fill them, even when they are 5x cheered. That can be done
by using the overdrives Eccentric and Hot Spurs. I don't know if they're
cumulative, so I used both in first part of the battle.
Once the second part of the battle comes, things get a bit harder because just
one character is attacked. However, the overdrive bars of the other two
characters will get full with each Penance attack still.
If the attacked character is Rikku, we just need to use Wakka's and Tidus'
overdrives against the arm, and Dispel rikku, of course, because of the break
statuses. And if the attacked character is Tidus or Wakka, he will get Rikku's
bar that will be filled.
However it is important to time things so that Penance doesn't attack in second
part of the battle when one of the overdrive bars is still full, because we
need almost all of the overdrives possible and wasting one is not what we want.
I know all this is not much of a big deal, because it's just a variant of a
strategy already known, but I thought I would share this with you because I
read some times that it is needed to have high luck levels, and with this
strategy it is not... Just be careful not to stop Tidus' and Wakka's overdrive
wrong.
If you would like to know, in my case Penance died after 39 arms died too, by
being hit by Wakka's turbos and all the possible quick hits to Penance, since
he has not so much luck levels as the arms do.

=============================================================================
X) STANDARD SG STAT MAXING ---> A839
=============================================================================
=============================================================================

**********************************
PREHISTORIC PART, AKA INTRODUCTION
**********************************

Q - Why should I bother?
A - Want to have a prolonged fun with your FFX? Then statistic maxing is one of
the ways for you. By the end of the game your chrs' stats will be in ranges
from 80-100. But the max value a certain stat can reach are:
- for HP 99999
- for MP 9999
- for Str, Def, Mag, Mdef, Agi, Eva, Acc and Luck 255

Q - How to get that high stats, when there's not enough nodes on SG and you
don't even get enough Spheres to fill up empty nodes?
A - Your answer lies in Monster Arena, which serves this purpose. By meeting
some requirements you can fight some strong enemies, which when defeated drop
powerful equipment and spheres that can be used to fill up empty nodes. You can
activate those nodes later and start increasing your stats.

Q - How will you teach me to stat max?
A - Unlike other stat maxing guides, I'll be taking different approach. I've
counted number of empty nodes (including Lock nodes that become empty nodes
when removed) on Standard SG in PAL version. The number is 268 empty nodes.
I've also spent some time to activate any and all nodes on SG with Tidus as a
test chr, noting down his stats at start and end of the process, calculating
the difference. These two pieces of informations combined allowed me to come up
with a stat maxing guide, that will in the end let your chrs have max stats
without ever using Clear Spheres. Yep, you read correctly. You WILL NOT have to
be bothered by capturing five of each fiend in order to be able to buy Clear
Spheres. I have also taken into account you haven't captured anything yet, you
don't have any celestial weapons, and what I think is most important - I have
written stat maxing guide without Yuna's help. Why? It is a fact that her
Nirvana, Moon Crest and Moon Sigil are easy to get, but what if you forgot
Destruction Sp. in Besaid and Macalania temple? Or in both? Then you have a
certain dark problem. And my guide helps you build max stats with that problem
taken into account. Anything and everything you'll need to know has beed
covered in first half of stat maxing guide, going all the way down to Step 21.

Q - Will I even need Clear Spheres then?
A - If you want neatly organized SG, then yes. But I start using them after I
cover SG using the first half of guide. Stat maxing guide using the help of
Clear Spheres will be done from Step 22 onward until the final step.

Q - I have NTSC version of the game. Will this stat maxing guide be useful for
me as well?
A - There are few differences you need to be aware of. For first: according to
few sources NTSC Sphere Grid has 828 nodes in total. For second: Following
first difference it is entirely possible that the amount of specific nodes is
different between NTSC and PAL (for example, while PAL has five STR +3 nodes on
SG, NTSC might have seven STR +3 nodes; note that I'm only guessing the amount
of STR nodes). Other than that, the rest of the information provided in this
section will be useful in your efforts to stat max.

Q - Shall we start?
A - Patiently. In order to be able to fight monsters that drop aforementioned
items, some preparations need to be done. With this, let us begin.

******************************************
PREPARATIONS FOR STAT MAXIMIZATION PROCESS
******************************************

---> Info corner 1 <---
I'll assume you're using the ordinary Sphere Grid (SG in further notes). It is
useful to know the following info about this SG...
Total number of nodes - 860
Total number of ability nodes - 85
Total number of nodes we can mess around with - 775
Wheee, lots of work ahead? Your final dream is to have entire SG covered with
+300 HP, +40 MP (these aren't so much needed) and +4 the-rest-of-the-stats
nodes.

---> Info corner 2 <---
Chr's ultimate weapons, in this game known as Celestial weapons, will be
mightily useful. Listed in Info corner 3 below are:
- what to do first to obtain means of getting celestial weapons
- chr's best weapons, where to get them and where to get upgrades for those
weapons
- finally, my evaluation of best weapons

---> Info corner 3 <---
*Obtaining the means*
Go to extreme north end of Calm Lands. Find a lady on a chocobo there. Talk to
her and tell her you would like to train a chocobo. Win at least first course.
Then quit. Talk to chocobo lady again and say you want to ride one. Take this
chocobo to southeastern part of Calm Lands and look for chocobo feather on the
ground. Press X above it. Dismount and exit to your right. You're at Remiem
temple. Mount the chocobo you'll see on the right. Win and you get Cloudy
Mirror.
Now go to Macalania Forest (enter it from Thunder Plains side). Look for a
shiny path. Near it are a child and a woman. They're missing their
father/husband. You can find him on the screen where your party used to rest
once before. Talk to him and he'll go away. Return to happy family... or is it?
Talk to them and they'll say that their child is missing. Now climb the shiny
path and on your way you'll run into that kid. Talk to him and he'll go away.
Approach the big sphere-like thingey behind him. You've got Celestial Mirror.

*Obtaining the weapons*
Caladbolg for Tidus
You must complete all training courses chocobo lady offers you. Then challenge
her to a race and win. Doing this will attract the guard that was 'guarding' a
small path leading down on extreme north of Calm Lands. Go down that path and
examine the insignia on the wall. Caladbolg is yours. Sun Crest can be found in
the room where you fought Y. woman. If you didn't get chest straight after
defeating her, Dark Bahamut stands in your way. For Sun Sigil you must win the
race with time *faster* then 0.0.0.

World Champion for Wakka
Win a couple of Blitzball games (8 or so should be enough). When you have the
airship, go to the bar where Kimahri picked a fight with Ronsos before. Talk to
the bartender and you'll get this weapon. If she says something like being even
better, win some more blitz games. After that you should get the weapon. You
get Jupiter Crest in Aurochs' locker room. Examine the lockers. One of them is
hiding the crest. Sigil will appear as a league prize once you've obtained all
overdrives for Wakka and he has appeared in at least 450 battles against
fiends.

Masamune for Auron
First item you'll need is Rusty Sword. Go to entrance of Cavern of the Stolen
Fayth. On this screen go right and up. At the end of the path you'll find Rusty
Sword. Now return to airship and pick Djose Highroad destination. On this
screen now go thru southwest exit and you'll appear in Mushroom Rock. Follow
the path (you'll know you're going right if you'll run into 4x Soft chest on
the way) and take first left you'll come across. Activate the stone lift by
pressing X. Examine the statue and choose Yes when prompted. Approach the sign
that appeared and Masamune is yours. For Mars Crest go to the place where S.
convinced few guards to let you thru the barricade. There's a path leading down
and right. Enter it and you'll be on Oldroad. Go all the way to the end and
you'll find Mars Crest in the chest. For Sigil you need to unlock
combined total of 10 Species and/or Area Creations.

Spirit Lance for Kimahri
Go to Thunder Plains. See those strange stones that glow sometimes? Approach
one of them (three in total) and press Square in front of it when it's glowing.
Do this three times and Qactuars will now be fightable. Now go to southern
Thunder Plains. Hug the right until you see a broken pillar of sorts. You'll
see a ghost of Qactuar (it's been said that following this ghost is useless and
I concur:)). Examine this 'pillar' with Square and Spirit Lance is yours.
Saturn Crest you need to go to Mount Gagazet where you fought Flux for third
time. Remember a bunch of pillars in the canyon not far from this battle point?
Between one of them is a chest with crest inside. And for Sigil... In Macalania
woods you'll need to complete both butterly mini-games. Do it successfully and
when you open the chest of second butterfly game completed you'll obtain the
sigil.

Nirvana for Yuna
Capture at least one of every fiend in Calm Lands. Open the chest that will
appear in front of Manager once you talk to him after that point. Moon Crest is
found at Besaid Beach - there's a small beach with chest. For Sigil you need to
defeat all of Belgemine's aeons in Remiem Temple and then choose to 'defeat'
her.

Onion Knight for Lulu
Go to Baaj Temple. After Geosgaeno is gone, examine the same room you fought
in. Somewhere hardly accessible (it may be just me) is a chest with Onion
Knight inside. For Venus Crest enter the Farplane. Venus Crest can be found
here. Note that it *isn't* there on your first visit to Farplane! And for Sigil
you have to dodge 200 lightning bolts consecutively. You cannot save inbetween
or seek shelter beneath rod towers. After you dodged 200 of them, chest in
front of Agency will contain the sigil.

Godhand for Rikku
Input GODHAND as a password when you have control of the airship. Then go to
that destination. At the end of the path is chest with this weapon. For Mercury
Crest you need to visit western part of Sanubia Desert - look in the chest on
one of sandpits. And for Sigil you must complete Cactuar sidequest in Sanubia
Desert. One of chests now accessible in the valley of the sandstorms houses the
sigil.
Quick reference:
- Tomay is near the oasis
- Rovivea can be found running around in east Sanubia desert in westernmost
dead end
- Chava? In same part of desert where Cactuar stone is find sign with '20%
off' stuff on it and examine it
- Alek and Aloja are in Central Sanubia desert in the part of it where there
are lots of ruins
- Vachella is in east Sanubia desert - examine save sphere here and...
- Robeya is in central desert's westernmost treasure chest
- Isrra? Make sure you *leave* this screen and come back - Isrra can now be
found in one of the holes
- Elio? Go to Oasis, then up on airship and then head for the place where you
fought Evrae for first time
- Flaile doesn't need to be found

*Evaluation*
- Tidus: weapon easy to get, but crest and sigil are entirely different story;
for crest you need to waste Dark Bahamut, and for sigil you have to win the
race with time faster than 0.0.0 - 6TH TOP PICK
- Wakka: weapon moderately easy to get, crest easy to get, sigil extremely
annoying and bothersome (especially when you keep resetting for n-teenth time
to get sigil to appear as the prize) - 7TH TOP PICK
- Auron: weapon easy to get, as is the crest... sigil needs a bit of work to be
done, but nothing annoying (first 11 areas [I excluded Sunken Cave cos of hard-
to-encounter Tonberry] with at least one of each fiend that appears there
captured will give you the sigil) - 2ND TOP PICK
- Kimahri: weapon and crest are easy to get, and sigil needs a bit of butterfly
hunting to be done; after you try for about an hour, you'll memorize the path
of little flying bastards so well that you'll surely succeed eventually (I'm
talking from personal experience - I haven't layed hands on butterfly catching
until I was collecting best weapons... after about hour or so I got my Saturn
sigil) - 3RD TOP PICK
- Rikku: weapon and crest are easy to get, and you don't have to do anything
difficult to get sigil - 1ST TOP PICK
- Yuna: weapon and crest are easy to get, and sigil can be obtained quite
easily; remember that you can summon multiple aeons against you-know-who's in
order to defeat them; there can be a stopper in getting Yuna's sigil in case
you forget to get Destruction Sp. treasures in all temples you've visited on
your journey; this stopper can appear in shapes of dark aeons, specifically
Dark Valefor and Dark Shiva - 4TH TOP PICK
- Lulu: weapon and crest are easy to get, but for sigil get ready with a lot of
nerves of steel - 5TH TOP PICK

*Your best party*
PAL players:
Party with which you're advised to undertake stat maxing quest is Rikku, Auron
and Kimahri - you will get their fully powered best weapons the soonest
(Kimahri's might take an hour or so). Use Yuna instead of Kimahri in case you
are able to get Anima and Magus Sisters, which means you got all Destruction
Sp. so far. Personally I used Auron, Rikku and Tidus (but Tidus only cos I got
his sigil before I got Kimahri's). Anyway, this stat maxing guide is done with
a thought that Yuna is unable to get Anima and Sisters.
NTSC players:
Definitely use Rikku, Auron and Yuna.
Before you start, I recommend getting Rikku's best weapon. With the help of
quick guide I provided it'll take you about an hour to get everything.
Kimahri's stuff will take you somewhere up to two hours. We'll take care of
Auron's on the way, but rest assured, you'll get your full-power Masamune
before stat maxing process begins for real.

I'll also take into the account the small chance in which you may have
forgotten to get Destruction Sp. chests in Macalania and Besaid temples, in
which case you have a certain tough boss in your way, also successfully nailing
you out for getting Anima and Magus Sisters.

And lastly, have the airship.:) Otherwise, almost all areas are accessible by
foot, but with airship it goes much faster. And now, stat maxing begins...

*********************************************************************
STEP 1 - LEARNING ABILITIES, GETTING DECENT STATS AND SOME GOOD ITEMS
*********************************************************************

Buy Capture weapons from Monster Arena manager for every character, doesn't
matter if you'll use them now, later or never. Customize those weapons with
First Strike weapon ability. First Strike is IMO very useful for all the fights
you're about to enter. You need Return Sp. for that. D'you have any left? If
not, don't fret, we'll get them in a minute. Manager will start crying that
he's missing all the monsters. Waaaah! Who wouldn't help the guy? Head into
Calm lands and start capturing monsters. You need at least one monster of
following: Skoll, Nebiros, Flame Flan, Shred, Anacondaur, Ogre, Coeurl, Chimera
Brain and Malboro. Rarer monsters (Malboro and Ogre) can be found a bit more
often in northwestern parts of Calm Lands. One of each shall raise
Chimerageist.

Now examine your items. If you still have any stat boosting spheres left from
your journey, use them on the grid now. They're a helpful starting boost to
your chrs. Don't bother with removing lock nodes if you don't have
corresponding lock spheres in your possession. You can get them, but that costs
money you don't currently have.

Save at nearby save sphere and venture into Calm Lands... make a trip (without
chocobo) to Rin's shop in Calm Lands. You're bound to capture few guys for the
arena. Save at save sphere near Rin's shop and start looking around the shop
itself. You'll encounter Malboro and Ogre sooner or later, just don't give up.
I recommend not forgetting to save every so often.

Okay, Chimerageist is opened. 1/10 of job for Auron's Mars sigil is done. Now
you need to defeat Chimerageist at least 3 times to get few precious Return Sp.
Quick copy and paste... Representation of Chimerageist's move order: Megiddo
Flame, Blizzara OR Thundara, 'Assault', Aqua Breath, repeat. First attack Geist
will use is completely random and cannot be predicted. However, once you see
what Geist has used, you're set for the remainder of battle. Megiddo Flame can
be nullified by Fireproof or better, Blizzara and Thundara can be reflected,
'assault' can be halved by Protect, and Aqua Breath nullified by Waterproof or
better.
In case Geist's too fast for you, (but he shouldn't really), use Yuna's help in
shape of aeons, which you can use to soften him up and then kill him. Do so
three times and you'll get 3 Return Sp. In case you get Dark Matter, reapply
fighting Geist until you get 3 Return Sp. Waste them by integrating them into
weapons for three chrs you'll be using. Right now it doesn't matter who you
will use, just choose your three favorites.

Done? Done! Board the airship and head for Besaid. Easy as pie! Capture one
Dingo, Condor and Water Flan to unlock Stratoavis (2/10 of Auron's sigil). If
you're going by this guide, right now you've also unlocked Earth Eater (which
is unlocked once you unlock *any* two area creation fiends).

Next destination is Kilika. Easy as pie again. Capture one Dinonix, Killer Bee,
Yellow Element and Ragora to unlock Malboro Menace (3/10 of Auron's sigil).

Now go to Mi'ihen Highroad... This is not hard, but will require bit more time
as you need to capture 8 fiends. Mi'ihen Fang, Ipiria, Floating Eye, White
Element, Raldo, Vouivre, Bomb and Dual Horn. One of each plastered unlocks
Kottos (4/10 of Auron's sigil).

Now for Mushroom Rock. One Raptor, Gandarewa, Thunder Flan, Red Element,
Lamashtu, Funguar and Garuda unlocks Coeurlregina (1/2 of Auron's sigil). For
Garuda you need to enter the screen called 'Mushroom Rock: Valley'. Garuda can
only be fought here.

Djose Highroad is next. Garm, Simurgh, Bite Bug, Snow Flan, Bunyip, Basilisk
and Ochu await your arrival. One of each unlocks Jormungand (6/10 of Auron's
sigil). Simurgh is most often found in the most northern part of Djose Highroad
near the sign that shows up as worldmap when examined. Right now you've
conquered 6 areas already. What does that mean? Catastrophe is unlocked at the
arena.

Thunder Plains are home of next fiends, one of each you need to capture:
Melusine, Aerouge, Buer, Gold Element, Kusariqqu, Larva, Iron Giant and
Qactuar. Combined they unlock Cactuar King (7/10 of Auron's sigil). Qactuars
can only be fought once you've prayed to at least one glowing Qactuar statue by
pressing Square button in front of it (three statues in total). Iron Giants can
be found in northern part of Thunder Plains.

Examine Macalania next. Find and capture one Snow Wolf, Iguion, Wasp, Evil Eye,
Ice Flan, Blue Element, Murussu, Mafdet, Xiphos and Chimera to unlock Espada
(8/10 of Auron's sigil).

Bikanel proves a bit tougher. One Sand Wolf, Alcyone and Mushussu are easy to
capture. Zu and Sand Worm on the other hand pack a huge amount of HP. Then
there's Cactuar, who has insane evasion (use someone with high Acc try to kill
it, also Provoke Cactuar so it doesn't run away). While you're here, I
recommend doing the Village of the Cactuars sidequest (if not done already -
for tips look a bit more up; alternatively, if you're bothered too much by
random encounters, wait a bit until we cover next area). In the end Abyss Worm
(9/10 of Auron's sigil) will be unlocked.

We already did Calm Lands, so let's move on.

Ah, Cavern of S. F. Yowie, Imp, Dark Element, Nidhogg, Thorn, Valaha, Epaaj,
Ghost (make deadly sure you capture one of these!!!) and Tonberry will in the
end unlock Don Tonberry (10/10 of Auron's sigil).

We have three areas left, but before we do them, let's return to the arena to
collect our prizes. Yes, yes, you can return to arena prior to that to collect
the goodies, but why bother? I recommend not wasting time going to and from,
but instead collect the stuff at once.

Talk to manager and he'll start heading over goodies:
- you've already received 60x Farplane Winds for unlocking Chimerageist
- for unlocking Stratoavis you get 99x Stamina Tonic
- for Earth Eater you get 60x Three Stars
- for Malboro Menace 99x Poison Fang
- for Kottos 99x Soul Spring
- for Coeurlregina 99x Candle of Life
- for Jormungand 99x Petrify Grenade
- for Catastrophe 99x Door to Tomorrow
- for Cactuar King 99x Chocobo Wing
- for Espada 60x Shining Gem
- for Abyss Worm 99x Shadow Gem
- for Don Tonberry 40x Silver Hourglass
- and Mars Sigil for Auron somewhere inbetween!!!
Don't modify anything just yet. We'll use the items we got later to create a
good armor. I forgot to mention that manager will let you take a first swing at
the fiend he created free of charge. I encourage you to at least take a go at
it, so you'll see what you will be up against.

Total result right now is 10 areas covered with at least one monster captured
(we left out Gagazet, I. Sin and O. Ruins), 2 Original cretins unlocked and 10
Area creations unlocked.

If you don't have Rikku's Godhand fully powered up yet, or you're troubled too
much by random encounters whilst looking for Cactuars, your next objective is
to get hold of No Encounter armor. You have two options: either you collect 30x
Purifying Salt, which is enough items to get one No Encounter armor, or you
fight Ghost in the arena (remember what I said before about capturing one
Ghost?). Purifying Salt is a rare steal from Fallen Monks in Z. Ruins, but I
advise against it. Much more advised way is to continuosly fight Ghost until he
spits out an armor with No Encounters. Saving beforehand is very good tip. If
you're worried about cash, no worries. If you're able to Overkill Ghost, you'll
get back as much gil as you payed in order to fight it. Sooner or later you'll
get that No Encounter armor. Once you do, equip it on whoever you got it for.
Wearer doesn't need to be in active party. Then get that sigil to maximise
Godhand's potential.

Second objective is to purchase weapons from Rin's shop in Thunder Plains. Pick
three fighters with high Str and buy weapons for them (two must know Provoke).
These weapons are four-slotted. They already come with Str+10% and Str+5% and
have two free slots. One slot will be used for First Strike (fight Chimerageist
for few of them). Leave the fourth slot empty for now. Go back to the arena.

Third objective is Cactuar you've captured. He gives 8000 AP when defeated and
12000 for an Overkill! I have an easy solution for this guy.;) Cactuar's Doom
count is set at 2 turns. And not long ago you received 99 Candles of Life.
Equip those First Strike weapons and pay 4000 gil (you get 1500 gil back when
Cactuar is defeated, or 3000 for Overkill, but fret not; Cactuar drops HP
Stroll and MP Stroll equipment often which can be sold for cash). Once you
enter the battle, you'll have three free turns, even if Cactuar ambushes you.
For these three turns you have you should do this: Use Candle of Life on
Cactuar, don't forget to Provoke Cactuar and try to slice it down with third
chr, hopefully getting an Overkill. In case you won't succeed in killing
Cactuar until its first turn, you've already won. [This document copyrighted to
Split Infinity. In case writer's name at the top isn't mine, the guide is
ripped. Report to lifearmor@hotmail.com.] Cactuar will most likely kill
Provoker with 10000 Needles (1 more turn left for Doom effect) and will be
killed on next turn it gets (you can kill it easily with second level element
gems). Remember to revive fallen chr (you'd best switch out between chrs in
order to get that big AP for as many chrs as possible). Once Cactuar bites the
dust on second turn it gets, you get your much needed AP. Reapply as necessary
until all chrs have finished their part of the grid.
NOTE: If you get bored easily doing that, switch to AP gaining trick described
way above (press CTRL + F, type in A840A, and press ENTER).
- Tidus knows Quick Hit
- Yuna knows Holy
- Lulu knows Flare
- Rikku knows Bribe
- Kimahri knows... well, whatever path you sent him down, but I recommend you
teach him Steal and Use
- Wakka knows Triple Foul
- Auron knows Sentinel
- of course, don't forget to activate stat nodes on the way

Okay, your chrs now know all of their skills that are located on their paths
over Sphere Grid. They also have at least somewhat decent stats, which means
you can now take onto last three areas. Another important achievement is that
Yuna's aeons have been bettered as well, even though you weren't using them a
lot - remember, as long as Yuna's stats rise (aeons' stats rise even if you
fight battles without Yuna in your party), so will aeons' (there is stat growth
limit tho').

Let's cover Gagazet next. Go to Gagazet and capture one Bandersnatch, Ahriman,
Dark Flan, Grenade, Grat, Grendel, Bashura, Mandragora, Behemoth, Splasher,
Achelous and Maelspike (latter three can be found in watery parts of Gagazet).
One of each drives by Catoblepas. By capturing *two* of each water fiend you'll
also unlock Shinryu.

Moving onto I. Sin dungeon. Here wear First Strike weapons you've purchased
before and customized when I advised you to. Capturable monsters found here are
Exoray, Wraith, Geminis (there's two kinds!), Demonolith, Great Malboro,
Barbatos, Adamantoise and King Behemoth. Words of advice are needed...
- Exoray is easy
- Wraith is a souped up Ghost, and likes to use Doom on first turn - until
second turn it'll already be dead
- Geminis are tough; Armor Break one and kill it ASAP to disable two Reaper
attacks in a row
- Demonolith is made harmless by using Silence Buster or Silence Grenade on it,
which disables its Pharaoh's Curse counter; remember to wear Stoneproof armors!
- Great Malboro is a pain; equip your Provoker with First Strike weapon and on
Provoker's turn Provoke Great M. to 'disable' Bad Breath, then kill it
- Barbatos can only be fought in 'city' area, which you can access once you
defeat Omnis; I don't recommend Armor Breaking it, else it'll counter with
Mortar lots of times, but it's your choice
- Adamantoise, eh? Mental Break it, then put it to sleep, then use magic on it
until it has little HP left at which point use a physical attack to capture it
- Behemoth King is another pain; all attacks sans its desperation move target
one chr, so you'll manage to stay alive till the end, when you can capture it
(interesting note: according to NTSC owners, Kingie ends with Meteor even if
you capture it in NTSC version; luckily for us, it doesn't do so in our
version). After all of this stuff is yours, Abaddon is now accessible.

And finally O. Ruins. Zaurus, Floating Death, Black Element, Halma, Puroboros,
Spirit (make sure you Provoke it or you'll be sorry), Machea, Master Coeurl
(capture one of these by all means!!!), Master Tonberry (wait until it gets
close, then unload on it) and Varuna. Capture one of each for Vorban. Now that
all area creations are unlocked, you also get access to Neslug.

Return to arena and get these prizes:
- for Catoblepas you get Blossom Crown (needed for Magus Sisters)
- for Shinryu you get 30x Megalixir
- for Abaddon you get 99x Lunar Curtain
- for Varuna you get 60x Designer Wallet
- for Neslug you get 99x Winning Formula

With this Step 1 of this informator is complete. You're ready for step 2.

************************************************************
STEP 2 - THREE SELECTED CHARACTERS LEARN IMPORTANT ABILITIES
************************************************************

What now? I know you've tried fighting arena creations, only to be defeated. I
did too. In order to survive you don't only need high stats, you need an
assortment of skills as well. IMO getting right skills before maxing stats
takes priority, therefore it is this what I'll discuss next: how to have all
chrs learn important abilities...

It is time to choose the party that will take care of those nasty overpowered
enemies. As stated before, I suggest Rikku, Auron and Kimahri, all with their
fully powered celestial weapons. If you have Anima and Magus Sisters, switch
Kimahri out for Yuna. If you don't have Anima and Magus Sisters, Yuna will act
as a backup in certain tough 'events'.

Which abilities do I deem important?
Esuna, Full-Life, Hastega, Slowga, Shell, Protect, Reflect, Dispel, Holy, Auto-
Life, Steal, Use, Entrust, Copycat, Quick Pockets, Doublecast, Bribe, Triple
Foul, Delay Buster, Full Break, Mug and Quick Hit.

No, no, no, I won't have you walking all over SG just to activate those nodes.
I'll provide you with an easy guide of how to obtain all of these nifty
abilities with ease...

Getting the cash
- sell off all of the excessive weaponry and armor you might have collected on
your journey and you don't need anymore
- equip Rikku with her Godhand (this is her best weapon I'm sure you've gotten
already) or in case you don't have one yet, customize any weapon with two free
slots with Gillionare (use 30x Designer Wallet you got not long ago) and First
Strike
- go to O. Ruins and save at nearby save sphere
- start circling around here and keep falling into random battles
- make sure Rikku (and First Striker) is (are) in frontline party
- most of fights are VS 1x Zaurus and 1x chest (it can be a Mimic)
- make sure you have Rikku Steal from the chest; if it says 'Nothing to
steal.', chest turns into one of four shapes of a Mimic
- defeat this bastard and you'll get 100000 gil
- Rikku must be in winning party or you won't get cash bonus
- for starters you'll need around 4000000 gil

Getting the hard-to-reach abilities for Rikku, Auron and Kimahri (Yuna)
WAY 1:
- head to monster arena
- pay to fight Master Coeurl
- Bribe it 130000+ gil for one Warp Sp. (you'll need about 15 of them)
- now pay to fight Coeurl
- Bribe it 60000+ gil for Friend Sp. (need about 45 of them)
- get 99 Ability Spheres
- now use Warp Sp. to warp to Full-Life node and use Ability Sp. to have Rikku
learn Full-Life
- now have Auron use Friend Sp. to teleport to Rikku's location and use Ability
Sp. to learn Full-Life (do the same for Kimahri, Yuna, or both)
- repeat the process of warpin' and stuff for these abilities: Auto-Life,
Copycat, Quick Pockets, Doublecast and Full Break

WAY 2:
- slaughter heaps of Cactuars so that you gain large amounts of AP with which
you can cross the grid
- alternatively, you can kill lots of Great Malboros or Master Tonberries for
two huge AP boosts
- another alternative to get lots of AP is AP gaining trick described way above
(press CTRL + F, type in A840A, and press ENTER)
- to get lock spheres with which you remove the locks at SG, you need to do a
bit of Bribing again: for Lv.1 Bribe Imp, for Lv.2 Bribe Behemoth, for Lv.3
Bribe Demonolith, for Lv.4 Bribe Chimera Brain
- the rest of the stuff is accomplished much the same as previous way

Learning the rest of important abilities
- according to abilities left (Esuna, Hastega, Slowga, Shell, Protect, Reflect,
Dispel, Holy, Steal, Use, Entrust, Bribe, Triple Foul, Delay Buster, Mug and
Quick Hit) you'll need 24 Wht Mag Sp., 12 Special Sp., and 12 Skill Sp.
- you can get Wht Mag Sp. by Bribing Dark Flan
- Special Sp. will be yours when Adamantoise is Bribed
- Skill Sp. are handed to you by Bribing Zu
- finding all of these guys is not hard, since we already captured one of each
when we were questing after area creations
- if in need of more cash, return to O. Ruins and continue slaughtering Mimics

Second step in accomplishing the task is complete. Although I've singled out
three (four) chrs, the others will get their turn once the selected chrs finish
their route across the SG.

*************************************************
STEP 3 - GETTING READY TO FIGHT SPECIES CREATIONS
*************************************************

Right. In step 3 I'll tell you how to access the chance itself to max the
stats. We'll need to unlock species creations. To do so you'll now have to
revisit each of the 13 areas and capture following amounts of stuff in order to
have Species conquest entry in the end look like this:
- Fenrir - capture at least 3 of each: Dingo, Mi'ihen Fang, Garm, Snow Wolf,
Sand Wolf, Skoll, Bandersnatch.
- Ornitholestes - capture at least 3 of each: Dinonix, Ipiria, Raptor,
Melusine, Iguion, Yowie, Zaurus.
- Pteryx - capture at least 4 of each: Condor, Simurgh, Alcyone.
- Hornet - capture at least 4 of each: Killer Bee, Bite Bug, Wasp, Nebiros.
- Vidatu - capture at least 4 of each: Gandarewa, Aerouge, Imp.
- One-Eye - capture at least 4 of each: Floating Eye, Buer, Evil Eye, Ahriman,
Floating Death.
- Jumbo Flan - capture at least 3 of each: Water Flan, Thunder Flan, Snow Flan,
Ice Flan, Flame Flan, Dark Flan.
- Nega Elemental - capture at least 3 of each: Yellow Element, White Element,
Red Element, Gold Element, Blue Element, Dark Element, Black Element.
- Tanket - capture at least 3 of each: Raldo, Bunyip, Murussu, Mafdet, Shred,
Halma.
- Fafnir - capture at least 4 of each: Vouivre, Lamashtu, Kusariqqu, Mushussu,
Nidhogg.
- Sleep Sprout - capture at least 5 of each: Funguar, Thorn, Exoray.
- Bomb King - capture at least 5 of each: Bomb, Grenade, Puroboros.
- Juggernaut - capture at least 5 of each: Dual Horn, Valaha, Grendel.
- Ironclad - capture 10 of each: Iron Giant, Gemini A, Gemini B.

IMPORTANT: If not already mentioned, you need Clear Spheres to remove crappy
nodes from SG. But in order to do so, you must capture at least 5 of every
capturable fiend in order to unlock Ultima Buster as well as being able to buy
Clear Spheres. Currently you DON'T need them yet.

Additionally, by unlocking two species creations Greater Sphere is also
unlocked. For six species creations open you get to fight Th'uban.

After this feast is complete (I bet you'll never want to see another Tonberry,
Master Tonberry, Simurgh, Ogre, Garuda and some other nice guys) return to the
arena to collect your rewards, which are:
- for unlocking Fenrir you get 99x Chocobo Feather
- for unlocking Ornitholestes you get 99x Stamina Spring
- for unlocking Pteryx you get 99x Mega Phoenix
- for unlocking Hornet 60x Mana Tonic
- for unlocking Vidatu 99x Mana Spring
- for unlocking One-Eye 60x Stamina Tablet
- for unlocking Jumbo Flan 60x Twin Stars
- for unlocking Nega Elemental 99x Star Curtain
- for unlocking Tanket 99x Gold Hourglass
- for unlocking Fafnir 99x Purifying Salt
- for unlocking Sleep Sprout 99x Healing Spring
- for unlocking Bomb King 60x Turbo Ether
- for unlocking Juggernaut 99x Light Curtain
- for unlocking Ironclad 60x Mana Tablet
- for unlocking Greater Sphere 60x Supreme Gem
- for unlocking Th'uban 99x Gambler's Spirit
- for unlocking Ultima Buster 99x Dark Matter

Almost everything unlocked except Nemesis (and Ultima Buster, if you didn't
bother capturing 5 of each fiend). Are you good or not?

*********************************
STEP 4 - FINAL STATISTIC PREPPING
*********************************

In this step I'll prep you up for upcoming battles against species creations.
You should be using Rikku with fully powered up Godhand, Auron with fully
powered up Masamune and Kimahri with fully powered up Spirit Lance (or Yuna, if
her Nirvana is fully powered).

What I'll write now may go against the common belief, but... Personally I think
that it is MUCH better that you try to cover all existing stat booster nodes on
SG *before* you take on any of newly created monsters in the arena. Sure, if
you have Yuna and all her summons, job is easy in this case, but many first
time FFX: PAL players forget to get Destruction Sp. treasures in the temples
and are later unable to win it back cos of certain would-be-tough guys. I have
had that experience.
Also, I don't think that raising HP above 9999 HP is necessary. Forget about
raising MP behind 999 MP - this value will more than suffice. I'll present a
chart with starting stats of playable chrs:

      Tidus   Rikku   Lulu   Yuna   Wakka   Kimahri   Auron
HP    520     360     380    475    618     644       1030

------------------------------------------------------------
Acc   10      5       3      3      25      5         3

Looks crappy, doesn't it? But fear not, after all stat nodes are activated,
picture drastically changes. This next chart shows how much does each stat
improve. I used Tidus and when he covered all nodes, he had following stats:
HP,   St,   Df,   Mg,   Mf,   MP,   Ag,   Lu,   Ev,   Ac
9999  187   160   147   129   999   184   36    134   80

So, what are the exact increases in every stat? The answer is in the below
chart. I'll list the after-stat, and subtract before-stat to get increase-stat.
Complicated? Naah.

        Before-stat          After-stat          Increase-stat
HP      520                  9999                9479
--------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------
Acc     10                   80                  70

Note: HP and MP are increased waaaay more cos of sea of HP and MP nodes that
are on SG. But where are those additional HP and MP, you ask? You need Break HP
Limit and Break MP Limit armor abilities for that. Don't worry tho', game
remembers all HP and MP. When you get those two abilities I mentioned, HP and
MP will be properly displayed. With all HP nodes on SG activated chrs' HP end
up somewhere around 20000 (when Tidus reached 9999, I counted 51 more HP nodes
before they were all activated).

Now I'll provide the stats your chrs can have when all of the existing stat
nodes have been activated, not counting the spheres you may have gotten and
used already.

What do you say now, huh? Aren't your chrs strong or aren't they strong?:)
Really, getting to activate all of the nodes on SG first is more fun to do then
trying to nail some of species creations who may prove way too tough. But hey,
you're nearly ready now, it's time we get you in the clothes you'll use for
next battles (to raise Luck you're advised to use Attribute Sp., which you get
by Bribing Maelspikes).

After everything is covered, ie all abilities learned, all stat nodes activated
and all Lock nodes removed, you will have 269 empty nodes available. Memorize
this number and in the continuing lines you will see how to best employ them.
First we'll want to max Strength. I'll tell what next once Str is covered.

Note: In this note I'll add what stat spheres you may have received if you've
been lucky enough...
- 1x Magic Sp. from Cloister in Djose temple
- 1x Magic Defence Sp. in Moonflow: South Bank Road
- 1x Luck Sp. in Kilika Forest
- 1x Luck Sp. in Macalania Temple
- 1x Luck Sp. in Dome: Corridor
- I may have been missing some, but it doesn't matter really.

*****************************
STEP 5 - FIRST ARMOR PREPPING
*****************************

What you need to do now is go to Macalania forest and find Wantz there. When
you find him, purchase empty 4-slotted armors from him 100000 gil a piece. If
by some strange coincidence Wantz isn't there, head into arena and fight
Adamantoises or Varunas. So far these two are only fiends I know of that drop
empty 4-slot armors. Last alternative for you is to go the airship and purchase
armors from Rin. It'll already have HP+10% armor ability integrated, but will
also have three free slots. We'll get more sets of armors in the long run, just
so you know it.

For first armor we'll be using you'll want to add Auto-Haste. 80x Chocobo Wing
is enough for one, thus making a final total of 240x Chocobo Wings. You got 99
of them for unlocking Cactuar King, and you can get the rest by Bribing Machea
from O. Ruins.
Next add Auto-Protect. You'll need 210x Light Curtains. You got 99x of them
from unlocking Juggernaut. Steal the rest from Iron Giant. Or engage against
Tanket. You can steal 4x Light Curtain per one successful steal. Or in case you
can win against Fafnir, he'll drop 20 of then when killed (40 for Overkill).
For third slot you want to employ Auto-Phoenix. 60x Mega Phoenix for three.
Bribe Ghost for Mega Phoenixes if you're running low on them.

First armor is prepped and ready to use. So equip Rikku with Godhand, Auron
with Masamune and Kimahri with Spirit Lance (Yuna with Nirvana) - all these
weapons must be fully powered up. Don't forget to equip newly created armors!
Also remember that Kimahri's and Rikku's best weapons deal more damage at full
HP, whilst Auron's deals more damage, lower he is on HP.

If you'll be running low on money, remember to return to O. Ruins and kill
Mimics there for money.

************************
STEP 6 - MAXING STRENGTH
************************

First stat you'll want to increase and I strongly urge you to do so is
strength... *activates Stat Scanner* ...Ah, our target is Juggernaut! So save
at the save sphere behind arena manager, talk to him and pay the cash to
engage...

He has 1200000 HP and needs to be dealt a finishing blow over 15000 damage to
get an Overkill. He drops 1x Strength Sp. (2x for Overkill). He can be status-
inflicted will all four Breaks. Here are his stats:
St, Df, Mg, Mf, Ag, Lu, Ev, Ac
98, 140,70, 62, 42, 15, 0,  32
Although his Def may intimidate you, he is very slow when compared to Agi of
your speedster chrs. Two to three chr's turns for one of Jugi's is a usual.
Don't bother with magic against Jugi, as he's impervious to any magic.
Juggernaut is an extremely easy species cretin - here's his move pattern:
Charging, Salvo (fire-based attack), complement of moves consisting of either
Attack or Crush Spike... after four Crush Spikes have been used..., Charging,
Salvo... ad infinitum.
As soon as battle starts, you're nearly set for him as you're already in Haste
and Protect statuses. As you see in upper right corner, you will have many
turns (eight or so) before Jugi gets his first turn. Use Full Break or Auron's
Banishing Blade on him, then switch to Quick Hits. Jugi's first turn will be
automatically wasted for Charging. Keep using Quick Hits to assault Juggernaut
mercilessly. Sometime before Jugi's second turn remember to cast NulBlaze on
your party. As Jugi's second turn approaches, you'll see three Immune appear on
screen. Sometime now Juggernaut will go 'Aaaaaaaaargh!!! How could you do that
to meeeeee???'. In case he's still not dead, you'll start seeing Crush Spike or
Attack. Crush Spike will kill chr targetted, but that chr will be revived
automatically by Auto-Phoenix in other chrs' armors. Attack on other hand will
deal about 2800 to 3000 to one of your chrs. Nothing dangerous, as you will
soon see. Wrestle that 1x Strength Sp. (or 2x, if you Overkilled him). Now
enter Sphere Grid and place that Strength Sp. into one of the empty nodes.
Activate it as well with Rikku, Auron and Kimahri (Yuna) to have their Str
increase by four points for the next battle. Closer you get to 255 Str, faster
Jugi will bite the dust, hehe.

POST-JUGGERNAUT-BATTLE-SPHERE-GRID-INFORMATOR

- Lowest Str stat is 177 of Lulu and Yuna. This means you're gonna need 20
Strength Sp. in order to reach max Str stat for all seven chrs. Proceed in
killing Jugi until you have that much. Lay waste upon SG using 20 Strength Sp.
you've just received and Str stat for all chrs is at 255 finally. Yay us. To
avoid traveling over too much of SG, I suggest fighting Sleep Sprout for
Teleport Spheres he drops. Then use Teleport Spheres to move close to those
empty nodes and fill them up with Str +4 nodes, that you later activate. If you
need lots of Power Sp. fast, engage in battle against Kottos, feed him one
Power Distiller and Overkill him to receive 40x Power Sp.
- Empty nodes remaining: 248 empty nodes.
- Next stat target: Defence
- but uhhh, there is an obstacle in the way, as Tanket causes Berserk... before
you nail him, we'll need another armor piece

***************************
BY-STEP 6 - FAFNIR OVERKILL
***************************

Fafnir is another creation that has set attack pattern, therefore this is why I
recommend fighting it for Light Curtains (you need those for Auto-Protect). He
has 1100000 HP and needs to be dealt finishing blow worth over 13000 in order
to get Overkill. He drops 20x Light Curtain (40x for Overkill). Overkill is
very much possible anyway since your chrs have max Str, therefore you'll need
to fight it 6 times to receive all Light Curtains you need. He's also
susceptible to all four Breaks. Here are his stats:
St, Df, Mg, Mf, Ag, Lu, Ev, Ac
76, 30, 109,130,38, 15, 0,  100
Even slower than Juggernaut. But he has a nasty trick, that'll be exploited
below. Once the battle commences, you are already in top shape when it comes to
Haste and Protect. If Auron has full Overdrive, Banishing Blade him or have him
use Full Break. Then resort to Quick Hits and Fafnir goes down somewhere around
his first attack, which would be simple 'Bash' for moderate (moderate cos of
Auto-Protect on) damage to one chr. In case you're still not able to defeat it
after his first and he gets around to second turn, remember to cast NulFrost
prior to it (use following move pattern to help you further decipher his next
attacks - 'Bash', Triple Attack *ice* [NulFrost], Triple Attack *fire*
[NulBlaze], Triple Attack *lightning* [NulShock], 'Bash', repeat the pattern).
Careful - Fafnir's triple-stage-attacks have Quick Hit properties... you'll
know what I'm talking about once you view the top right corner of the screen.
Nab him six times or more if he drops some Dark Matters.

***************************
STEP 7 - SECOND ARMOR PIECE
***************************

Purchase another three armors from Wantz / defeat Adamantoise to receive empty
4-slot armor. Buying from Rin on airship is not recommended anymore, so I urge
you to resort to these two ways.
What shall we integrate in this armor? This time we have four slots to work
around with. In one integrate Auto-Haste (Bribe Machea for Chocobo Wings), in
second Deathproof (Bribe Epaaj for Farplane Winds), in third Berserkproof
(Bribe Floating Eye for Musks), in fourth Confuseproof (Bribe Raldo for Hypello
Potions). This armor will help us in getting Defence and Agility to the max.
IMPORTANT: Purchase additional armor piece for Auron! Extremely important! In
first slot integrate Ribbon using 99x Dark Matters you got if you were bothered
enough to unlock Ultima Buster. If you don't have them yet, or have
insufficient amount of them, save them for later.

***********************
STEP 8 - MAXING DEFENCE
***********************

Strength alone isn't sufficient. Without high Defence you don't stand a chance
against many of Original creations, as well as dark aeons. For Defence boosting
we'll... *activates Stat Scanner* ...take on Tanket.

Prior to battle make sure you equip armor which we lastly created, ie the one
containing Deathproof, Berserkproof and Confuseproof. For this battle
Berserkproof will take care of nasty things.

Tanket is another slowpoke in species creation assortment. And yep, he has an
attack 'pattern' as well. He has 900000 HP and needs to be dealt finishing blow
worth over 10000 in order to get Overkill. He drops 1x Defence Sp. (2x for
Overkill). Overkill is very much possible anyway since your chrs have max Str.
He's also susceptible to Armor Break and Mental Break. His stats:
St, Df, Mg, Mf, Ag, Lu, Ev, Ac
103,100,3,  250,41, 15, 0,  100
Slow? Yes? Nasty trick? Yes. Easy anyway? With a little trick, yes. At start of
battle have Auron execute Banishing Blade or Full Break on Tanket to soften him
up. Important thing in this battle is to keep track of how much damage you did
to Tanket. If you're hitting for 99999 (use Quick Hits!), stop at fourth
attack. At this point *always* have Auron use Sentinel until Tanket's next
attack. Auron will counter, dealing a blow, pushing Tanket's HP over 1/2 lost,
thus forcing him in switching to Rush Attack... but you won't see any, as you
will now have way more then five turns left in which you deal another five
99999-s to Tanket, successfully sending him to the Farplane. If you're worried
by Berserk you were being inflicted with in earlier battles, no worries. That's
why we have Berserkproof here - to never be Berserked. Also don't worry about
having delayed turns - as Agi is pretty high, it won't matter.:) Bye, Tanket.

POST-TANKET-BATTLE-SPHERE-GRID-INFORMATOR

- Lowest Def stat is 155 of Yuna. This means you're gonna need 25 Defence Sp.
in order to reach max Def stat for all seven chrs. Proceed in killing Tanket
until you have that much. Lay waste upon SG using 25 Defence Sp. you've just
received and Def stat for all chrs is at 255 finally. Yay us. To avoid
traveling over too much of SG, I suggest fighting Sleep Sprout for Teleport
Spheres he drops. Then use Teleport Spheres to move close to those empty nodes
and fill them up with Def +4 nodes, that you later activate. If you need lots
of Power Sp. fast, engage in battle against Kottos, feed him one Power
Distiller and Overkill him to receive 40x Power Sp.
- Empty nodes remaining: 223 empty nodes.
- Next stat target: Accuracy
- Hornet has two status attacks he will annoy you with: Bewitching Stab
inflicts Confusion (Confuseproof armor we already have) and regular 'Stab'
inflicts KO (what a coincidence - we also have Deathproof armor)

************************
STEP 9 - MAXING ACCURACY
************************

Physical prowess of our chrs has been taken care of. Now let's make sure they
have some means of (nearly) always hitting the enemies... *activates Stat
Scanner* ...oh, gosh, it's Hornet!

Prior to battle make sure you equip armor which we lastly created, ie the one
containing Deathproof, Berserkproof and Confuseproof. For this battle
Deathproof and Confuseproof will take care of nasty things.

Hornet is *not* another slow bastard, so do not get too confident. He has
620000 HP and needs to be dealt finishing blow worth 99999 in order to get
Overkill. He drops 1x Accuracy Sp. (2x for Overkill). Overkill *will* be
possible anyway since your chrs have max Str. He's also susceptible to all
Breaks. His stats:
St, Df, Mg, Mf, Ag, Lu, Ev, Ac
63, 70, 88, 95, 102,15, 17, 100
He's a lot faster than his previous buddies. He's also a bit more skilled at
evading attacks, but you will miss maybe in one out of five tries. Nothing
majorly worrying. What could be worrying, but isn't, are his attacks.
Bewitching Stab's Confusion won't work, KO that 'Stab' carries won't work...
you will be inflicted by Poison, Sleep and Darkness, however. Cure them with
simple Esuna.
As battle starts, just let it all out with Quick Hits (use Aim a few times if
you think you miss too often - soon that will improve), only stopping if Hornet
manages to put someone to sleep. Yes, I suggest ignoring Poison and the damage
it does to you - concentrate on downing Hornet instead. With Auto-Haste in
place each of your chrs will be getting two to three turns for one Hornet's.
Not shabby, eh?

POST-HORNET-BATTLE-SPHERE-GRID-INFORMATOR

- Lowest Acc stat is 73 of Lulu and Yuna. This means you're gonna need 46
Accuracy Sp. in order to reach max Acc stat for all seven chrs. Proceed in
killing Hornet until you have that much. After each Hornet battle remember to
visit SG to use Accuracy Sp. you've just won in order to improve Acc for next
Hornet battle, eventually allowing you to hit him with no problem. Also
remember laying waste upon SG until 46 Accuracy Sp. are used and Acc stat for
all chrs is at 255 finally. Yay us. To avoid traveling over too much of SG, I
suggest fighting Sleep Sprout for Teleport Spheres he drops. Then use Teleport
Spheres to move close to those empty nodes and fill them up with Acc +4 nodes,
that you later activate. If you need lots of Speed Sp. fast, engage in battle
against Kottos, feed him one Speed Distiller and Overkill him to receive 40x
Speed Sp.
- Empty nodes remaining: 177 empty nodes.
- Next stat target: Agility
- Fenrir, like Hornet, has two status attacks he will annoy you with: Fangs of
Chaos inflict Confusion (Confuseproof armor we already have) and Fangs of Hell
inflict KO (what a coincidence - we also have Deathproof armor)

************************
STEP 10 - MAXING AGILITY
************************

Str, Def and Acc. What a glorious trio. How about adding another member to the
clan? *activates Stat Scanner* ...Fenrir! Finally. I've been wanting to see
what this wolf is capable of.

Prior to battle make sure you equip armor which we lastly created, ie the one
containing Deathproof, Berserkproof and Confuseproof. For this battle
Deathproof and Confuseproof will take care of nasty things.

Warning! Currently Fenrir is faster than all of your chrs... or is he? Thanks
to Auto-Haste you're ensured that your chrs will be getting one or two turns
for each of Fenrir's. He has 850000 HP and needs to be dealt finishing blow
worth 99999 in order to get Overkill. He drops 1x Agility Sp. (2x for
Overkill). Overkill *will* be possible anyway since your chrs have max Str.
He's also susceptible to Magic Break and Mental Break, none of which interest
us, since we won't be using magic against him. His stats:
St, Df, Mg, Mf, Ag, Lu, Ev, Ac
73, 40, 12, 165,200,15, 60, 50
Lot faster than Hornet, also having pretty high evasion. But what was the last
thing we were collecting? Accuracy Sp.! Kiss your Evasion goodbye, Fenrir.
Luckily for us Agility of your chrs is another stat that was pretty populated
on SG, meaning you don't have to fight lots of Fenrirs...
At start of battle... you already know what to do, yes? Quick Hits all the
way... Fangs of Chaos is gravity attack, based on current HP, meaning it won't
kill you, no matter how hard Fenrir can try. It is used the most among the
three attacks Fenrir has to offer. Fangs of Hell can be avoided in maybe 2 out
of 5 times, but we don't have that much Evasion yet to guarantee 100% evasion.
Fangs of Ruin needs some further assessment to be done on my part (?????
doublecheck what the heck Fangs of Ruin do?????). You'll get five or six turns
for one Fenrir's (as we've only started collecting Agility Sp.), more if you're
using Quick Hits (watch the number of turns skyrocket once you gain 255 Agi).
As you cannot be inflicted with any dangeruos status except being KO-ed
normally by Fangs of Hell, your only job is to use Quick Hit, or Quick Pocket a
Phoenix Down to revive fallen ally.

POST-FENRIR-BATTLE-SPHERE-GRID-INFORMATOR

- Lowest Agi stat is 179 of Lulu and Auron. This means you're gonna need 19
Agility Sp. in order to reach max Agi stat for all seven chrs. Proceed in
killing Fenrir until you have that much. After each Fenrir battle remember to
visit SG to use Agility Sp. you've just won in order to improve Agi for next
Fenrir battle, eventually allowing you to hit him more times he can imagine.
Also remember laying waste upon SG until 19 Agility Sp. are used and Agi stat
for all chrs is at 255 finally. Yay us. To avoid traveling over too much of SG,
I suggest fighting Sleep Sprout for Teleport Spheres he drops. Then use
Teleport Spheres to move close to those empty nodes and fill them up with Agi +
4 nodes, that you later activate. If you need lots of Speed Sp. fast, engage in
battle against Kottos, feed him one Speed Distiller and Overkill him to receive
40x Speed Sp.
- Empty nodes remaining: 158 empty nodes.
- Next stat target: Magic Defence
- One-Eye has multi-target multi-status inflicting attack... news that you and
I don't like. Maybe you're thinking that we'll create new armor for him. If you
want to, go for it. I'll provide another section dedicated to creating armor
piece just for One-Eye battles. For those that would like to skip making
another armor, I have a little trick as well.

******************************
BY-STEP 10 - THIRD ARMOR PIECE
******************************

One-Eye's Shockwave inflicts magic type damage along with Confuse, Sleep,
Silence, Darkness and Slow. Silence and Darkness are hardly of being dangerous,
but we need to take care of other three.
Head to Wantz's again and purchase another three armors with four empty slots.
In the slots input Confuseproof (Bribe Floating Eyes for Musks), Sleepproof
(Bribe Skoll for Dream Powders) and Slowproof (Bribe Mushussu for Gold
Hourglasses). Leave fourth slot empty for now. Why not Auto-Haste instead of
Slowproof? I think it's a waste. Your chrs have 255 Agi and when you compare
this to One-Eye's Agi of 38, it makes you laugh.

******************************
STEP 11 - MAXING MAGIC DEFENCE
******************************

Physically your chrs are as tough as they can get, but what about magic
toughness? *activates Stat Scanner* ...One-Eye? The name couldn't fit better...

Prior to battle either make sure you equip armor which we lastly created, ie
the one containing Slowproof, Sleepproof and Confuseproof, or make sure Auron
is equipped with Masamune.

Warning! One-Eye has extremely high probability of ambushing you, in which case
you will get struck with Shockwave (injects Confuse, Sleep, Silence, Darkness
and Slow). One-Eye has 150000 HP and needs to be dealt finishing blow worth
over 15000 in order to get Overkill. He drops 1x Magic Defence Sp. (2x for
Overkill). Overkill *will* be possible anyway since your chrs have max Str.
He's also susceptible to Armor Break and Power Break, none of which interest
us. His stats:
St, Df, Mg, Mf, Ag, Lu, Ev, Ac
55, 58, 77, 183,38, 15, 10, 18
Anyone needs speed? You chrs got it... and they've got it lots. If you listened
to my advice before, this battle will become extremely easy. But let's discuss
both ways anyway... If you went in skipping making third armor set, Auron will
be first to act. If One-Eye ambushed you, choose to Flee the battle. If One-Eye
is encountered normally, or you even gained Initiative on him, kill him before
he gets his first turn. Doing so is 100% sure you'll never even get hurt, but
it also costs money you'll waste paying to fight One-Eye, only to find out he
ambushed you and having no option left but to flee. Spending a bit more time
instead on gathering the ingredients for third armor I suggested putting
together will be 100% sure way you'll always emerge victorious.
One-Eye's Evasion and Darkness he can inflict with Shockwave won't help him one
bit in evading any of your attacks... maybe one out of ten, by which he'll
already be defeated, as he only packs 150000 HP (true, he has infinite Regen,
but who cares about that when he can't make full use of it, right?).

POST-ONE-EYE-BATTLE-SPHERE-GRID-INFORMATOR

- Lowest Mdef stat is 129. Strangely, all boys have that much. This means
you're gonna need 32 Magic Defence Sp. in order to reach max Mdef stat for all
seven chrs. Proceed in killing One-Eye until you have that much. After each
One-Eye battle remember to visit SG to use Magic Defence Sp. you've just won in
order to improve Mdef for next One-Eye battle, slowly but surely decreasing the
damage he can do to you with Shockwave. Also remember laying waste upon SG
until 32 Magic Defence Sp. are used and Mdef stat for all chrs is at 255
finally. Yay us. To avoid traveling over too much of SG, I suggest fighting
Sleep Sprout for Teleport Spheres he drops. Then use Teleport Spheres to move
close to those empty nodes and fill them up with Mdef +4 nodes, that you later
activate. If you need lots of Mana Sp. fast, engage in battle against Kottos,
feed him one Mana Distiller and Overkill him to receive 40x Mana Sp.
- Empty nodes remaining: 126 empty nodes.
- Next stat target: Evasion
- Pteryx is much like One-Eye in few aspects... likes to ambush you and has
little HP. Very luckily for us Pteryx doesn't have dangerous statuses throwing
around - he can only Curse you or delay your next turn (which won't matter cos
of high Agi stat).

IMPORTANT: One-Eye can be your richest cash-cow so far. He frequently drops
three slotted Triple AP weapons, which can be sold for 67000+ gil. Since you
can dispose of him in two attacks, I'd recommend switching to this money
earning, as I bet you're tired of seeing Mimics already.

************************
STEP 12 - MAXING EVASION
************************

Sixth stat we're about to max... *activates Stat Scanner* ...Pteryx? Another
flying-o bastard-o.

Prior to battle equip first armor we created, ie the one containing Auto-
Phoenix, Auto-Haste and Auto-Protect.

Pteryx also has extremely high probability of ambushing you, in which case you
will get struck with Beak of Woe (Curses!). Pteryx has 100000 HP and needs to
be dealt finishing blow worth 99999 in order to get Overkill. He drops 1x
Evasion Sp. (2x for Overkill). Overkill *will* be possible anyway since your
chrs have max Str. He's also susceptible to all Breaks. Not like I care. His
stats:
St, Df, Mg, Mf, Ag, Lu, Ev, Ac
90, 100,5,  100,60, 15, 60, 100
Let's laugh a lot. Strategy is not even needed for this guy. Two Quick Hits and
it is all over, doesn't matter if you got ambushed or not.

POST-PTERYX-BATTLE-SPHERE-GRID-INFORMATOR

- Lowest Eva stat is 129. Rikku, Auron, Wakka and Kimahri are guilty. This
means you're gonna need 32 Evasion Sp. in order to reach max Eva stat for all
seven chrs. Proceed in killing Pteryx until you have that much. Remember laying
waste upon SG until 32 Evasion Sp. are used and Eva stat for all chrs is at 255
finally. Yay us - we're almost at the end. To avoid traveling over too much of
SG, I suggest fighting Sleep Sprout for Teleport Spheres he drops. Then use
Teleport Spheres to move close to those empty nodes and fill them up with Eva +
4 nodes, that you later activate. If you need lots of Speed Sp. fast, engage in
battle against Kottos, feed him one Speed Distiller and Overkill him to receive
40x Speed Sp.
- Empty nodes remaining: 94 empty nodes.
- Next stat target: Luck
- Why Luck next and not Magic? Personally I think Magic is completely useless
stat to max in FFX. You will fight toughest enemies of the game with pure
strength and skills that involve raw power. Rare occassions that will force you
to rely on magic power will be narrowed down to reviving with Life or Full-
Life, curing status ailments with Esuna or Dispel, and maybe occassional
Hastega or Slowga. But you know, there are other ways that do the job better,
you just need time and will to know where to look for it. Casting attack magic
is fairly useless for two things: it doesn't pay off as toughest enemies have
high magic defence and I don't want to see Ultima for x-times, where x equals
split infinity. I forgot to add that you need to fight Jumbo Flan in order to
get Magic Sp. It's 'pure' coincidence he can only be damaged by magic (there
are exceptions - Ifrit's Meteor Strike and some Overdrives deal damage to Jumbo
as well). No thanks, I'll pass on that. That's why.

**************************
STEP 13 - PART-MAXING LUCK
**************************

Yep, you read correctly. After all 255 you've seen Luck will be raised only
partly until further notice. There are two reasons to do this: You need to
fight Greater Sp. for Luck Sp. and Earth Eater for Fortune Sp. Furthermore, you
need one Fortune Sp. per one activation of Luck +4 node. Meaning? One Luck +4
node can only be fully activated with 7 Fortune Sp. Man, imagine the number of
Earth Eaters you'll have to kill.

Getting Luck Spheres
You'll need to engage VS Greater Sphere. While I have an easy strat for him,
you'll get bored easily, so make sure you're listening to some music. For
starters I would like to aim for 100 Luck stat for three chrs (or four... you
know, Yuna and Kimahri stuff, blah blah), just enough that you have little to
no problems wasting first four dark aeons.

Equip first armor we created prior to battle, ie the one containing Auto-
Phoenix, Auto-Haste and Auto-Protect. Greater Sphere packs 1500000 HP, with
99999 worth of damage counting for an Overkill. He drops 1x Luck Sphere (2x for
an Overkill). His stats:
St, Df, Mg, Mf, Ag, Lu, Ev, Ac
87, 130,102,120,55, 15, 0,  72
Pretty slow, but dangerous anyway. To get all chrs' Luck to 100 and above,
we'll need 17 Luck Spheres. Subtract three you received so far (hopefully you
didn't use them for Mixes) and number decreases to 14 only. Let's calculate
small probability of Greater Sphere dropping Dark Matters in 1 out 4 cases...
I'd say you'll need to waste about 12 Greater Spheres. Let's do it.
As battle starts, yawn at GS' poor choice of how he wants to be positioned
during battle. After he's put together, Quick Hit him. For each attack you'll
see Ultima counter. At full Mdef it deals 900 damage to all. You may need to
heal once or twice during the process. For last chr that has a turn before GS,
do not let that chr attack. Instead heal to full with Healing Water or
Megalixir. GS regular turn can be Hydraulic Press, which hurts. 16 Ultimas
later GS lays defeated and 2x Luck Sphere is yours.

Getting Fortune Spheres...?
I really really don't recommend doing this if you don't have Tidus or Wakka
with their fully powered best weapons. Multi-hit overdrives are a must against
Earth Eater. He can be killed with chrs I suggested to use throughout maxing-
the-stats process, ie Rikku, Auron and Kimahri, but it'll take another millenia
before you gather enough Fortune Spheres. Unfortunately, you will have to deck
few Earth Eaters in order to get Fortune Sp., needed to activate Luck nodes.

Getting Attribute Spheres
Again we take shelter in Bribing. You will need 34 Attribute Sp. in case Yuna
can already be part of battle party with fully powered Nirvana, or 51 Attribute
Sp. in case Yuna can't be part of battle party yet. Enemy to look for is
Maelspike, who can be Bribed for Attribute Sp. You will need about 8000000 gil
for this small feast (kill One-Eye and then sell weapons he drops or fight
Mimics in O. Ruins; additionally sell off all weapons and armors you got from
fighting previous creations). Bribe Maelspike with 100001 gil and then keep
giving it 1 gil until it goes away. Of course remember to save before any
Bribes are made.

POST-GREATER-SPHERE-AND-MAELSPIKE-BATTLE-SPHERE-GRID-INFORMATOR

- We'll raise Yuna's, Kimahri's, Rikku's and Auron's Luck to 100 with 17 Luck
Sp. we just got. Then have one of those chrs use one Fortune Sp. for each Luck
node that was newly created, and have the rest of chrs use Attribute Sp. to
activate the nodes. Luck is now 100, enough to waste Dark Valefor and Dark
Shiva with a little to no difficulty.
- Empty nodes remaining: 77 empty nodes.

***************************************
STEP 14 - YUNA 'ALMOST' ENTERS THE FRAY
***************************************

Before continuing I deem it is now time that Kimahri will be forced to step out
of the field and let Yuna enter occassionally. All of her stats are now at 255
sans Luck and Magic (you don't need latter anyway).
First thing to do is enter the airship. Input the coordinates for Baaj Temple:
X between 11 and 16, Y between 57 and 63. Enter newly discovered destination.
Go up the screen and fall into the water. Kill Geosgaeno who appears with one
hit.:) If you killed him before, much better. While still in the water, swim
north to reach the interior of Baaj temple. After climbing some steps you'll
reach Antechamber with six statues.
Top left belongs to Besaid, middle left Macalania, bottom left Zanarkand, top
right Bevelle, middle right Djose and bottom right Kilika. By approaching the
statue it will light up, meaning you broke the seal for respective temple. BTW,
Bevelle statue will light up automatically, there's *no way* you could've
missed that one.
This means we can now get all of Destruction Sp. from all the temples (except
Bevelle one, which we were forced to collect in order to be able to exit it).
- Kilika temple, Djose temple and Zanarkand temple will let you extract
Destruction Sp. with no problems
- you will run into flying problem when trying to approach Besaid temple and
you will run into speedy problem when trying to approach Macalania temple

************************************************
BY-STEP 14 - WASTING DARK VALEFOR AND DARK SHIVA
************************************************

Prior to Dark Valefor battle equip first armor we created, ie the one
containing Auto-Phoenix, Auto-Haste and Auto-Protect.
Valefor packs 800000 HP and needs to be dealt finishing blow worth 99999 in
order to get Overkill. He drops 1x Dark Matter (2x for Overkill). Overkill
*will* be possible anyway since your chrs have max Str. His stats:
St, Df, Mg, Mf, Ag, Lu, Ev, Ac
148,120,186,220,105,48, 10, 250
He's moderately fast in comparison to your chrs, but we have Auto-Haste in
place and Auto-Protect. Following is info on damage estimates done to party at
max stats without Shell and Protect in place: 'Swipe' deals 3700 damage, Energy
Ray deals about 1000 damage to all, Energy Blast deals 50000 damage to all
(cannot be halved in any way), Sonic Wings deals about 1200 damage.
As you can see, only danger lies in Energy Blast, which is only used when
Valefor's Ovedrive gauge charges to the max. Among other turns Valefor will be
using Energy Ray, 'swipe' and Sonic Wings, none of which are particularly
dangerous.
Accuracy is at its max (supported by 100 Luck), therefore you will have little
trouble hitting Valefor. If you just can't seem to hit it, use Aim few times (5
times is max before using it becomes obsolete). Don't bother with magic, unless
you have 255 Mag and Doublecast. I suggest using only physical attacks.
Valefor's Overdrive charges to max after he's been attacked for 8 times. Just
before his next turn (at which he'll unleash Energy Blast), either cast Auto-
Life on Kimahri, Rikku and Auron, or have last chr with a turn before Valefor's
switch in Yuna, who summons an aeon to take the damage (I recommend doing the
latter). Aeon will die, but you will not. Heal with Megalixirs or Healing
Waters (you can steal them from Adamantoises) and switch Yuna back in reserve
for whoever you traded before. Nine 99999 hits later Dark Valefor is defeated.
Besaid temple can now be entered again.

IMPORTANT: Remember before when I suggested of purchasing additional four-
slotted armor piece for Auron? You must have 99x Dark Matters by now, cos I'm
definitely sure you collected that much of them from killing monster arena
creations. Auron's next armor will contain Ribbon (99x Dark Matter), Auto-Haste
(Bribe Machea for Chocobo Wings), Auto-Protect (defeat Fafnir for Light
Curtains) and Deathproof (Bribe Epaaj for Farplane Winds).

Prior to Dark Shiva battle equip first armor piece we created, ie one
containing Auto-Haste, Auto-Protect and Auto-Phoenix. Equip Auron with lastly
created armor!!! Don't attempt to fight Dark Shiva without that armor.
She's fast! That's why you need 255 Agility and Auto-Haste. Following is info
on damage estimates done to party at max stats without Shell and Protect in
place: 'kick' deals 6000 damage, Heavenly Strike deals about 10000 damage, and
Diamond Dust 85000 damage to all (cannot be halved in any way). She's also
dangerous cos of her Quick Hit ability, as you will see in CTB window when in
battle against her. Her stats:
St, Df, Mg, Mf, Ag, Lu, Ev, Ac
173,163,244,255,255,73, 0,  250
As battle starts, resort to Quick Hits immediately. Your aim is to defeat her
before she gains Overdrive. If you get ambushed, strategy changes a little.
Thanks to Masamune's First Strike ability Auron will have a turn before Shiva
does. Have Auron execute Sentinel! Regardless of Shiva using Heavenly Strike or
'Kick', Auron will run in to intercept the attack, take the damage and
counterattack by dealing Shiva some damage. For whole battle keep having Auron
execute Sentinel. Shiva has inherent ability of Quick Hit. You can easily see
so in CTB window in upper right corner. When she uses 'Kick' or Heavenly
Strike, see how fast she'll get next turn... after all of your chrs take one -
and this is at 255 Agi and Auto-Haste!
Meanwhile Kimahri and Rikku use Quick Hits to attack Shiva, successfully
cycling her HP down to zero. As Shiva has higher Luck than Valefor, missed
attacks are more often, but IMO still nothing to be worried about. Do not
forget to heal Auron every now and then (at max Def he'll take 1500 damage from
'Kick' and 2500 damage from Heavenly Strike if Auron is under Auto-Protect and
Sentinel), but use Quick Pockets!
If you think Shiva will be able to pull off Overdrive, cease attacking. Do not
give in into thinking that you may just be lucky enough to kill her before
Diamond Dust - remember that you can miss in your attacks. Instead resort to
following defence: on either Rikku's or Kimahri's last turn (*NOT* Auron's - he
must remain in battle at all times!!!) before Shiva's Diamond Dust have one of
them switch out and bring Yuna in, who will summon an aeon to take the damage
for you. After aeon dies, switch Yuna out and bring either Rikku or Kimahri
back into battle (depending on who you switched out) and then proceed using the
strategy I wrote above and by the time Shiva would use Diamond Dust for second
time you will defeat her.

Guado attack! Run from these guys all the way to the right so that you enter
screen called 'Lake Macalania: Crevasse'. Once here, return to Macalania temple
entrance and you can now enter without problem.

All of the Destruction Sp. have been collected! Now return to Baaj temple and
grab your Anima.

******************************************
STEP 15 - YUNA ENTERS THE FRAY PERMANENTLY
******************************************

Now that temple fun is behind us, few things await us. For Yuna we still need
to get two of her summons - Yojimbo (in case you don't have him already) and
Magus Sisters. You have to get Yojimbo first.

Getting Yojimbo
We'll visit Cavern of S. F. again. Remember Tonberry and you'll know straight
away where it is located. Go to very back of the cavern, where you'll meet
someone from Lulu's past. This someone will summon Yojimbo, who will engage in
battle against your party. Do I need to mention how pathetically easy he is
when compared to your 255 stats? One strike from any member will send him on
the floor (if only I could kill that annoying dog).
After the battle you'll visit Antechamber where Yojimbo will ask you what do
you wish from him. Answer something, then hand over 300000 gil and he's yours
to command in future battles.

Getting Magus Sisters
For these gals you'll need to visit Remiem temple (east exit from Calm lands,
accessible only with chocobo). Enter the temple and you'll find Belgemine. Talk
to her. Her too...? Accept her challenge, which is besting her in eight levels
of Tetris. You can't choose level eight right from the start, you'll have to
work your way up gradually. After you defeat level five, you win Flower
Scepter. If you got Anima, level six is now accessible. Best it. If you got
Yojimbo, level seven is now accessible. Best it as well.
This is it! Now approach the strange door behind Belgemine and you will be able
to enter. When Yuna exits, Magus Sisters are yours. Talk to Belgemine again and
level eight is now accessible. Best that as well, and finally say farewell to
Belgemine who will go where she belongs. Moon sigil is yours at last, meaning
Yuna's Nirvana is about to be at peak of its power!

Kimahri is now at last forced to leave the party and make place for Yuna, who
will make her glorious entrance.

**************************************
STEP 16 - PRE-FINAL STATISTIC OVERVIEW

It's time I present you with another chart showing you stats of all seven chrs.

Acc   255     255     255    255    255     255       255

****************************************
STEP 17 - PRE-FINAL SPHERE GRID OVERVIEW
****************************************

We haven't deleted single node up to now, yet already your chrs are able to
kick ass left and right. Not to mention the behind, hehe.:)
There's still 77 empty nodes remaining on SG that can be filled with something.
One part of that something I suggest you pour into 38 Luck Sp. (but it isn't
needed!), with which Luck stat will reach 255 value.
Yes, I am aware that having 255 Luck, Evasion and Accuracy is not needed.
Y'see, you can have one of the following:
- either you have 150 Luck, 255 Eva and 255 Acc
- or you have 255 Luck, 150 Eva and 150 Acc
... and you'll get roughly same results. But tell me, doesn't it fill you with
feeling of completion when you take a look at status screen and you see nothing
but 255? Well, in my stat maxing guide everything but Mag.
Subtracting that will come into running total of 39 empty nodes still remaining
on SG. You're left to do with them as you please, but many players go for HP
nodes (get them from killing Ironclad in species creation list). If you
absolutely must have Mag at 255, you'll need 27 Magic Sp. (get them from
killing Jumbo Flan).

*****************************************
STEP 18 - WASTING IRONCLAD AND JUMBO FLAN
*****************************************

Prior to Ironclad battle equip first armor we created, ie the one containing
Auto-Phoenix, Auto-Haste and Auto-Protect. If Yuna doesn't have it yet, make
one for her. For Auron stick to his Ribbon armor we have made.

Ironclad is a nice guy. He has a set attack pattern, 2000000 HP and counters
anything. He needs to be dealt finishing blow worth 99999 in order to get
Overkill. He drops 1x HP Sp. (2x for Overkill). He's also susceptible to all
Breaks except Power Break. His stats:
St, Df, Mg, Mf, Ag, Lu, Ev, Ac
100,220,0,  180,65, 15, 0,  50
Strategy? If you insist. First a representation of how Ironclad moves:
Reppageki (used also as counter), Bushinzan, Shinryudan, Reppageki, Bushinzan,
Shinryudan, repeat as much times as needed. Bearing biggest HP of species
creations you'll want to have high Eva and Str for this battle, both of which
we already have. And way over as well.
When battle starts, we're already in Haste and Protect. Anything funny you try
on Ironclad, he'll try Reppageki on you. Now if your Eva is thru the roof,
he'll miss. Bushinzan and Shinryudan on the other hand always hit. Make sure
you heal immediately after Bushinzan. Restore MP too, as Bushinzan has Osmose
effect. Other than that, it's just a matter of Quick Hitting him until he dies.
Watching Yuna strike for 99999 changes one's view of her entirely.

Now that we have a bunch of HP nodes, stick them into SG. For those that are
aching in magic field, here's a brief entry for Jumbo Flan. For those that
don't care about magic, skip to Step 19.

Prior to Jumbo Flan battle equip first armor we created, ie the one containing
Auto-Phoenix, Auto-Haste and Auto-Protect. If Yuna doesn't have it yet, make
one for her. For Auron stick to his Ribbon armor we have made.

Jumbo Flan is not a nice guy - he's immune to any physical attack (funnily
Overdrives deal damage to him), and he can only be harmed by magic. He has
1300000 HP and needs to be dealt finishing blow worth 99999 to gain Overkill.
He drops 1x Magic Sp. (2x for Overkill). He's susceptible to Darkness (what for
I dunno) and Slow. His stats:
St, Df, Mg, Mf, Ag, Lu, Ev, Ac
3,  255,98, 80, 60, 15, 0,  0
Strategy? Long, boring and tiresome. Jumbo Flan is immune to any weapon-based
attack, absorbs all elements sans holy, is under constant Reflect and packs a
big HP. For starters cast Reflect on one of your chrs, then Slow on that chr so
it will bounce off and hit Jumbo (or use Silver/Gold Hourglass on Jumbo).
Doublecast Flares the same way you just casted Slow. Now repeatedly Copycat
these two Flares you just casted and sooner or later Jumbo will subdue to
missing HP. Sometimes if low on HP, Jumbo will attempt the following: he'll
cast Reflect on one of your chrs, then *immediately* Curaga. On next turn/s
he'll do Reflect/Curaga combo again (in case you dispeled Reflect), Regen (in
case you don't dispel Reflect) or Ultima. Speaking of which, I believe that
lower Jumbo is to defeat, more of Ultima you'll be seeing.
Anima's Pain bypasses Reflect and is a magical attack. Spare Change works, as
do Overdrives and Ifrit's Meteor Strike.

POST-IRONCLAD-AND-JUMBO-FLAN-BATTLE-SPHERE-GRID-INFORMATOR

- You have 77 empty nodes remaining.
- Personally I'm mostly leaning onto having all stats at 255 except Mag and
Luck. Luck IMO is sufficient enough to be at 160. You will be able to kill
everything in the game with that stats. Yes, all dark aeons and Penance. True,
you may still miss with physical attacks against some of later dark aeons
(Magus Sisters), but I've done my best to find out strategies which allow you
to beat them very easily (for example, my Dark Bahamut, Dark Magus Sisters and
Penance strategies).

***********************************
STEP 19 - FINAL STATISTICS OVERVIEW
***********************************

First chart is based on my preferred final stats: all stats at 255 except Mag
and Luck. Leave Magic stat as it is (ie raised only with Mag +1, 2, 3 or 4
nodes already integrated into SG) and Luck being raised onto 160.
As you have 77 empty nodes left remaining, this means you need to get 15 more
Luck Sp. Subtracting that gives us 62 empty nodes still left. Fill them with 62
HP Sp. Lying below is chart with final statistics.
Note: HP stats are rough estimates (ie give/take 1000 HP)

Looks good, eh? I very highly recommend this ending chart!

Second chart is meant for players who want to have 255 in every stat. Having so
high stats they will, but at expense of lower HP. With 77 empty nodes remaining
(and based on last stats of your chrs) you will need 38x Luck Sp., 27x Magic
Sp. and 12x HP Sp. Lying below is a chart with final stats in this case.

become crushed under sheer power and speed.

*******************************
STEP 20 - HALL OF MONSTER SHAME
*******************************

Crappy name, but I couldn't think of anything more catchy. Anyway, what will
you find here? Before reading on about stat maxing saga (naaah, we're far from
finished) I'd like to renew a memento on something.

Remember before we become so powerful, you tried to fight area, species and
original creations, only to see few 99999 appear on your chrs who were KO-ed?
Well, in here I'll show you the damage they can do to you with damage-dealing
attacks (yep, I won't be mentioning status inflicting attacks) once your stats
are all at 255. You will notice an *enormous* difference. Unless specified,
attack mentioned targets one chr.

STEP 21 - SOME BANTER FROM WRITER
*********************************

There, another monstrous task is completed, albeit only half of it. I didn't
think there is any other way possible than always buying those dange Clear
Spheres, but after I took my time to study SG more closely and doing some math
it became entirely possible to max chrs' stats without help of Clear Spheres.

Now that first halftime is behind me, there is a second halftime. Yep, in next
part of stat maxing guide I will specialize in restructuring SG entirely with
help of Clear Spheres. Doing this will not cause some drastic changes, but your
HP will gain an enormous boost in the end in case you're not satisfied yet with
the amount of HP you already have. Let us undertake on the dirty job...

****************************************************
STEP 22 - STAT MAXING CONTINUED (WITH CLEAR SPHERES)
****************************************************

In case you fall into class of people that likes having neatly organized SG,
you've come just to the right section. In here I shall guide you through
tormenting way of buying Clear Spheres, clearing the crappy nodes, installing +
4 nodes, buying more Clear Sphere, more clearing, more installing... sometime
during this 1000 Don Tonberries will get killed... Anyway, it'll be boring for
a while. There are few pre-steps you'll have to read thru.

****************************
STEP 25 - CLEAR SPHERES INFO
****************************

Clear Spheres are items you'll now be buying like mad, since we need to delete
many crappy nodes in order to organize the SG neatly.
First step in getting Clear Spheres is capturing five of every fiend. Doing
this will unlock Ultima Buster, as well as making Clear Spheres appear in Item
shop of arena manager. One Clear Sphere will relieve you of 10000 gil. Clear
Spheres can remove any node from SG except: Lock nodes, White and Black Magic
nodes, Skill nodes and Special ability nodes.
In next step I'll make another chart showing how many nodes from each stat
category you'll need to delete exactly, making necessary adjustments. Do not
attempt to delete anything yet! Take that chart only as an info corner to see
what you'll need to do.

STEP 27 - CHARACTER'S STATISTICS OVERVIEW BEFORE CLEAR SPHERE-ING
*****************************************************************

This part is of informative type as well. I will list here the stats your
characters would have in *case all of the crappy nodes would have been
deleted*. Doing so will help you and me calculate just how much spheres of each
type you'll need to get to install them into SG, thus making SG consist only of
+4 nodes. Anyway, first are stats with Luck of 160 and Mag not being touched at
all, while the rest are stats that are left only with +4 nodes, while the rest
are deleted.

STEP 28 - CALCULATING AMOUNT OF SPHERES YOU NEED FOR EACH STAT
**************************************************************

Another two-part subpart, I'm afraid. Two calculations have been done, based on
stats of each stat maxing process I suggested. First, as usual, will be stat
maxing guide with Luck of 160 and Mag not being changed.

- for HP you won't need any spheres, but you can accrue 203x HP Sp. if you wish
to have an enormous HP
- for MP you won't need any spheres
- for STR you'll need 20x Strength Sp.
- for DEF you'll need 26x Defence Sp.
- for MAG you won't need any spheres
- for MDEF you'll need 15x Magic Def Sp.
- for AGI you'll need 23x Agility Sp.
- for LUCK you won't need any spheres
- for EVA you'll need 12x Evasion Sp.
- for ACC you'll need 13x Accuracy Sp.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This line-up shows amount of spheres needed in case all core stats are 255.

- for HP you can accrue up to 236x HP Sp. if you wish to have an enormous HP
- for MP you'll need 18x MP Sp.
- for STR you'll need 20x Strength Sp.
- for DEF you'll need 26x Defence Sp.
- for MAG you'll need 18x Magic Sp.
- for MDEF you'll need 15x Magic Def Sp.
- for AGI you'll need 23x Agility Sp.
- for LUCK you'll need 3x Luck Sp.
- for EVA you'll need 12x Evasion Sp.
- for ACC you'll need 13x Accuracy Sp.

STEP 29 - FIGHTING SPECIES CREATIONS FOR SPHERES

This shouldn't take long... as long as you don't start collecting HP Sp. If
only Ironclad wouldn't counter, battles against him would go so much faster.

*****************************************
SOME LAST TIPS FOR PLAYERS WITH HP GROOVE
*****************************************

No, this isn't another chart or so, I just made yet another subpart for people
who keep mailing me with stuff on how to achieve 99999 HP without having an
armor with HP+??% abilities in it. It's quite simple actually.
If you take a look at stat maxing guide - 160 Luck and Magic untamed - you
prolly know what I'm saying from beginning... Magic sucks! So successfully get
rid of all Magic nodes - 47 nodes in total. Replace them with 47x HP Sp. for
another (calculates) 14100 HP added to current total, thus making chrs have
around 95000 HP already.

HP    Tidus   Rikku   Lulu   Yuna   Wakka   Kimahri   Auron
      94420   94260   94280  94375  94518   94544     94930

Soooo, we need 20x HP Sp. still. Poor Ironclad. But which 20 nodes to erase? I
suggest getting rid of 20 MP +20 nodes which still lurk on SG. The rest of MP
nodes remaining still give + 600 MP boost to chr's base MP value, which is more
than enough for any and all MP needs.

Once also those MP nodes have been erased, you will now have 99999 HP for every
character. You can now throw away those HP+??% armors.

************************************
STATS GO IN HAND WITH GOOD EQUIPMENT
************************************

I see you're still around. *thinks* What the heck did I forget to put down? A
good weapon and armor suggestion, you say? Why not.

It's a common belief (at least I get that impression) that it's good to have
enormous amounts of HP and MP as well as 255-ish stats. Well, personally I
believe it is *not* a good thing to have over 9999 HP and 999 MP. Let me
explain why...
- Having huge amounts of HP is not good. You will need to spend many turns
healing in prolonged battles (Nemesis and Penance, for example).
- Amount of HP (MP in cases of Yuna and Lulu, but since they have One MP Cost
ability on their ultimate weapons, this is hardly a thing to worry about) also
directly relates to amount of damage celestial weapons can do (less HP means
less damage) - now imagine your chrs all have 99999 MAX HP, but their current
HP is 25000 or so; and compare to having your chrs have 9999 MAX HP, but their
current HP is 2500 or so - how many turns does each scenario require you to
heal? Latter only one. The only exception is Auron, who deals more damage lower
his current HP is - and even for him it is *not* necessary to build his HP over
9999 (having 1 HP at 9999 MAX HP or 99999 MAX HP... which is better?).
- Then there are gravity-type attacks which deal damage based on MAX HP.
Quickest example that jumps to mind is Greater Sphere's Hydraulic Press, which
tears off 93,75% of MAX HP. Were you to have over 50000 HP, how many turns
would you need to heal back to top (disregard Rikku's mix of Ultra Potion for
this scenario)? And how many turns would you need in case your MAX HP is only
9999? My point exactly.
- Are you *really* willing to spend many hours wasting Ironclad in the arena
for HP Spheres it drops? Your time could better be used elsewhere...
- Then last requirement to actually have over 9999 MAX HP is Break HP Limit
armor ability. Unless you get one on an armor Nemesis drops, you'll need Wings
to Discovery, for which you need to kill Shinryu (your time is better off doing
something else) or Bribe Malboro-type enemies (quite expensive and unreliable).
Remiem temple race with three open chests is one-time deal only.
- There are no 99999 damage dealing attacks in the game that cannot be
predicted, bypassed, blocked by an aeon taking the damage or prevented by doing
something (cast Auto-Life for example). Heck, even dark aeons overdrives are
easily predicted, for there is a nice bar showing how close they are to
unleashing the overdrive. If you can prevent or anticipate the attack, then why
the hell bother building your HP up to 99999 MAX HP, if you're going to die
anyway?
- Few sections up I made a chart showing damage area, species and original
creations can do to you once your stats have been maxed. With few exceptions
most attacks deal way less than 9999 damage - which makes having HP over 9999
hardly a necessity. Even for dark aeons you will not need that much HP.
I was able to defeat and devise a perfect foolproof strategy against Penance,
toughest enemy in FFX. I did it with only 9999 HP, stats at 255, celestial
weapons and armors having following abilities: Auto-Protect, Auto-Haste,
Def+20% and Auto-Potion. I took time to study Penance's attacks and based on
that info, I weighed my possibilities until I was able to write a very good
Penance strategy... But, this section is not for gloating about Penance's
demise, it's for armor information you have come looking for.
- Let's discuss MP and magic stat for a bit now. Does Jumbo Flan haunt the very
core of your existence? It sure does mine *laughs*. I grew tired of seeing
Anima's Pain animation after fifth Jumbo Flan fight. Based on my FF8 experience
(where magic attacks were completely useless IMO, physical attacks were the way
to go) I tried the same with this FF as well. In FFX magic attacks are again
useless (with few exceptions), and physical attacks are the way to go.
- But it is a good thing to use magic against Greater Sphere, Th'uban etc.
Please! Although they counter if you attack them physically, what do the
counters matter if you can survive them? And which is faster - animation of chr
doing physical attack or animation of chr casting Ultima?
- There are items which help you MP-wise rather than having enormous MP...
these are Twin Stars and Three Stars. Use them in battle and your MP cost has
been nullified.

Let's take a look first over armor abilities game has to offer. You can choose
from 74 different armor abilities. I'll single out the ones worth having. Under
each recommended ability you'll see amount of items you need for one such
ability to be made and under the amount all of possible ways to obtain that
item (I have excluded the chances that item might appear as blitzball prize).

1. Deathproof
- need 60x Farplane Wind for one
- defeat Don Tonberry
- Bribe Epaaj, Ahriman, Wraith
- rare Steal from A. aeon, Wraith, Espada, Sleep Sprout
- Steal from Varuna, Coeurlregina
- unlock Chimerageist
- Master Coeurl, Master Tonberry, Coeurlregina, Don Tonberry, Catoblepas,
Fenrir, Dark Anima all have a chance of dropping armor with this ability

2. Auto-Shell
- need 80x Lunar Curtain for one
- Steal from Crawler, Defender X, Larva, Defender, Defender Z, One-Eye, Jumbo
Flan, Juggernaut

7. No Encounters
- need 30x Purifying Salt for one
- rare Steal from both Warrior Monks, both Fallen Monks, Hornet

- Bribe Land Worm (impossible anyway cos you're past the point of no return)
- rare drop of all area, species and original creations
- unlock Ultima Buster
- defeat dark aeons, Penance's arms
- Penance, dark aeons (continuously fight Dark Yojimbo) have a chance of
dropping armor with this ability

Out of 74 we have 9 trustworthy abilites left. The remaining 65 do suck and you
don't need them. And now you have the means to obtain items you need with ease.

Good armor or best armor? A tough fact, but there is *no* best armor. We can
make some good armors instead. Based on my experience in this game, you will
stand awesome chances against anything with following three sets of armors.

GOOD ARMOR SET 1 (meant for everyday battles)
Auto-Protect, Auto-Haste, Ribbon, Auto-Phoenix

GOOD ARMOR SET 2 (meant for prolonged battles)
Auto-Protect, Auto-Haste, Ribbon, Break HP Limit

ARMOR SET 3 (meant for anything status related, including attacks that bypass
Deathproof armor ability)
Deathproof, Ribbon, Auto-Phoenix, Auto-Haste

WHATEVER ARMOR YOU WISH
If none of these three armors I suggested suit you, feel free to make your own
preferred armor. What I do recommend is that you use abilities mentioned above.

- never put anything besides No Encounters; it's a waste of items and free
slot... maybe MP Stroll or HP Stroll, as someone on GameFAQs FFX board
suggested
- never put Master Thief on armor if any of above 8 mentioned abilites is
already present; it's a waste of items and free slot

That's all I had to say for an armored section. Let's shift into expert gear
now!

XI) EXPERT SG STAT MAXING ---> A846
=============================================================================
=============================================================================

**********************************
PREHISTORIC PART, AKA INTRODUCTION
**********************************

Q - Expert Sphere Grid (ESG)? Wot dat?
A - Expert Sphere Grid is one of two SGs PAL players can choose from when
starting a new game of FFX. ESG is *not* available in NTSC version.

Q - Why the heck a separate section for it? Aren't they the same?
A - Nope. ESG has less nodes that standard SG to work with. And nodes that are
available on ESG aren't in same amounts than on standard SG.

Q - So, what *is* going to be different here?
A - The charts and nodes overview parts will be totally changed (number-wise,
not structure-wise). I'll also omit some of the stuff that I don't deem
necessary to be in this part.

Q - Will stat maxing process for ESG be different than that of standard SG?
A - Like stat max guide for Standard SG, I'll stick to same requirements for
this guide. I've counted number of empty nodes (including Lock nodes that
become empty nodes when removed) on ESG. The number is 277 empty nodes. I've
also spent some time to activate any and all nodes on ESG with Lulu as a test
chr, noting down her stats at start and end of the process, calculating the
difference. These two pieces of informations combined allowed me to come up
with a stat maxing guide, that will in the end let your chrs have max stats
without ever using Clear Spheres. I have also taken into account you haven't
captured anything yet, you don't have any celestial weapons, and what I think
is most important - I have written stat maxing guide without Yuna's help. Why?
It is a fact that her Nirvana, Moon Crest and Moon Sigil are easy to get, but
what if you forgot Destruction Sp. in Besaid and Macalania temple? Or in both?
Then you have a certain dark problem. And my guide helps you build max stats
with that problem taken into account.

Q - Will I even need Clear Spheres then?
A - If you want neatly organized SG, then yes. But I start using them after I
cover ESG using the first half of guide. Stat maxing guide using the help of
Clear Spheres will be done near the end.

**********************************************
PREPARATIONS FOR ESG STAT MAXIMIZATION PROCESS
**********************************************

This part will be short.

- First you need to know brief info on amount of nodes on ESG:
Total number of nodes - 805
Total number of ability nodes - 85
Total number of nodes we can mess around with - 720

- You should bother a bit to get best weapons for Rikku, Auron and Kimahri (or
Yuna instead of Kimahri, if you can get her Moon sigil). For brief info on
where and how to obtain them look in section XXXVII (Standard SG stat maxing
guide, Info corner 3).

- Your best party:
Party with which you're advised to undertake stat maxing quest is Rikku, Auron
and Kimahri - you will get their fully powered best weapons the soonest
(Kimahri's might take an hour or so). Use Yuna instead of Kimahri in case you
are able to get Anima and Magus Sisters, which means you got all Destruction
Sp. so far. Anyway, this stat maxing guide is done with a thought, that Yuna is
unable to get Anima and Sisters.
Before you start, I recommend getting Rikku's best weapon. With the help of
quick guide I provided (section 36, Info corner 3) it'll take you about an hour
to get everything. Kimahri's stuff will take you somewhere up to two hours.
We'll take care of Auron's on the way, but rest assured, you'll get your full-
power Masamune before stat maxing process begins for real.

- And lastly, have the airship.:) Otherwise, almost all areas are accessible by
foot, but with airship it goes much faster. And now, stat maxing begins...

*********************************************************************
STEP 1 - LEARNING ABILITIES, GETTING DECENT STATS AND SOME GOOD ITEMS
*********************************************************************

Buy Capture weapons from Monster Arena manager for every character, doesn't
matter if you'll use them now, later or never. Customize those weapons with
First Strike weapon ability. First Strike is IMO very useful for all the fights
you're about to enter. You need Return Sp. for that. D'you have any left? If
not, don't fret, we'll get them in a minute. Manager will start crying that
he's missing all the monsters. Head into Calm lands and start capturing
monsters. You need at least one monster of following: Skoll, Nebiros, Flame
Flan, Shred, Anacondaur, Ogre, Coeurl, Chimera Brain and Malboro. Rarer
monsters (Malboro and Ogre) can be found a bit more often in northwestern parts
of Calm Lands. One of each shall raise Chimerageist.

Now examine your items. If you still have any stat boosting spheres left from
your journey, use them on the grid now. They're a helpful starting boost to
your chrs. Don't bother with removing lock nodes if you don't have
corresponding lock spheres in your possession. You can get them, but that costs
money you don't currently have.

Okay, Chimerageist is opened. 1/10 of job for Auron's Mars sigil is done. Now
you need to defeat Chimerageist at least 3 times to get few precious Return Sp.
For info on kicking his ass look above... but I think you already experience
from before.:)
In case Geist's too fast for you, (but he shouldn't really), use Yuna's help in
shape of aeons, which you can use to soften him up and then kill him. Do so
three times and you'll get 3 Return Sp. In case you get Dark Matter, reapply
fighting Geist until you get 3 Return Sp. Waste them by integrating them into
weapons for three chrs you'll be using. Right now it doesn't matter who you
will use, just choose your three favorites.

Done? Done! Board the airship and head for Besaid. Capture one Dingo, Condor
and Water Flan to unlock Stratoavis (2/10 of Auron's sigil). If you're going by
this guide, right now you've also unlocked Earth Eater (which is unlocked once
you unlock *any* two area creation fiends).

Next destination is Kilika. Capture one Dinonix, Killer Bee, Yellow Element and
Ragora to unlock Malboro Menace (3/10 of Auron's sigil).

Now go to Mi'ihen Highroad: Mi'ihen Fang, Ipiria, Floating Eye, White Element,
Raldo, Vouivre, Bomb and Dual Horn. One of each plastered unlocks Kottos (4/10
of Auron's sigil).

Now for Mushroom Rock. One Raptor, Gandarewa, Thunder Flan, Red Element,
Lamashtu, Funguar and Garuda unlocks Coeurlregina (1/2 of Auron's sigil). For
Garuda you need to enter the screen called 'Mushroom Rock: Valley'. Garuda can
only be fought here.

Djose Highroad is next. Garm, Simurgh, Bite Bug, Snow Flan, Bunyip, Basilisk
and Ochu await your arrival. One of each unlocks Jormungand (6/10 of Auron's
sigil). Simurgh is most often found in the most northern part of Djose Highroad
near the sign that shows up as worldmap when examined. Right now you've
conquered 6 areas already. What does that mean? Catastrophe is unlocked at the
arena.

Thunder Plains are home of next fiends, one of each you of course need to
capture: Melusine, Aerouge, Buer, Gold Element, Kusariqqu, Larva, Iron Giant
and Qactuar. Combined they unlock Cactuar King (7/10 of Auron's sigil).
Qactuars can only be fought once you've prayed to at least one glowing Qactuar
statue by pressing Square button in front of it (three statues in total). Iron
Giants can be found in northern part of Thunder Plains.

Examine Macalania next. Find and capture one Snow Wolf, Iguion, Wasp, Evil Eye,
Ice Flan, Blue Element, Murussu, Mafdet, Xiphos and Chimera to unlock Espada
(8/10 of Auron's sigil).

Bikanel: Sand Wolf, Alcyone and Mushussu are easy to capture. Zu and Sand Worm
on the other hand pack a huge amount of HP. Then there's Cactuar, who has
insane evasion (use someone with high Acc try to kill it, also Provoke Cactuar
so it doesn't run away). While you're here, I recommend doing the Village of
the Cactuars sidequest (if you're bothered too much by random encounters, wait
a bit until we cover next area). In the end Abyss Worm (9/10 of Auron's sigil)
will be unlocked.

We already did Calm Lands, so let's move on.

Ah, Cavern of S. F. Yowie, Imp, Dark Element, Nidhogg, Thorn, Valaha, Epaaj,
Ghost (make deadly sure you capture one of these!!!) and Tonberry will in the
end unlock Don Tonberry (10/10 of Auron's sigil).

We have three areas left, but before we do them, let's return to the arena to
collect our prizes. Yes, yes, you can return to arena prior to that to collect
the goodies, but why bother? I recommend not wasting time going to and from,
but instead collect the stuff at once.

Talk to manager and he'll start heading over goodies:
- you've already received 60x Farplane Winds for unlocking Chimerageist
- for unlocking Stratoavis you get 99x Stamina Tonic
- for Earth Eater you get 60x Three Stars
- for Malboro Menace 99x Poison Fang
- for Kottos 99x Soul Spring
- for Coeurlregina 99x Candle of Life
- for Jormungand 99x Petrify Grenade
- for Catastrophe 99x Door to Tomorrow
- for Cactuar King 99x Chocobo Wing
- for Espada 60x Shining Gem
- for Abyss Worm 99x Shadow Gem
- for Don Tonberry 40x Silver Hourglass
- and Mars Sigil for Auron somewhere inbetween!!!
Don't modify anything just yet. We'll use the items we got later to create a
good armor. I forgot to mention that manager will let you take a first swing at
the fiend he created free of charge. I encourage you to at least take a go at
it, so you'll see what you will be up against.

If you don't have Rikku's Godhand fully powered up yet, or you're troubled too
much by random encounters whilst looking for Cactuars, your next objective is
to get ahold of No Encounter armor (defeat Ghost). Sooner or later you'll get
that No Encounter armor. Once you do, equip it on whoever you got it for.
Wearer doesn't need to be in active party. Then get that sigil to maximise
Godhand's potential.

Second objective is to purchase weapons from Rin's shop in Thunder Plains. Pick
three fighters with high Str and buy weapons for them (two must know Provoke).
These weapons are four-slotted. They already come with Str+10% and Str+5% and
have two free slots. One slot will be used for First Strike (need Return
Spheres - fight Chimerageist for few of them). Leave the fourth slot empty for
now. Go back to the arena.

Third objective is Cactuar you've captured. Continuously Overkill it for 12000
AP. If you get bored easily doing that, switch to AP gaining trick described
somewhere else in this guide (press CTRL + F, type in A840A, and press ENTER).

What abilities to learn? For info on this look into Sphere Grid Guide (section
9), where I listed down the order of abilities your chrs can learn while
traversing over SG. True, it applies for standard SG, but all of these
abilities are accessible same way on ESG.

Okay, your chrs now know all of their skills that are located on their paths
over Sphere Grid. They also have at least somewhat decent stats (whose nodes
they've activated while traveling over SG), which means you can now take onto
last three areas. Another important achievement is that Yuna's aeons have been
bettered as well, even though you weren't using them a lot - remember, as long
as Yuna's stats rise (aeons' stats rise even if you fight battles without Yuna
in your party), so will aeons' (there is stat growth limit tho').

Let's cover Gagazet next. Go to Gagazet and capture one Bandersnatch, Ahriman,
Dark Flan, Grenade, Grat, Grendel, Bashura, Mandragora, Behemoth, Splasher,
Achelouse and Maelspike (latter three can be found in watery parts of Gagazet).
One of each drives by Catoblepas. By capturing *two* of each water fiend you'll
also unlock Shinryu.

Moving onto I. Sin dungeon. Here wear First Strike weapons you've purchased
before and customized when I advised you to. Capturable monsters found here are
Exoray, Wraith, Geminis (there's two kinds!), Demonolith, Great Malboro,
Barbatos, Adamantoise and King Behemoth. After all of this stuff us yours,
Abaddon is now accessible.

And finally O. Ruins. Zaurus, Floating Death, Black Element, Halma, Puroboros,
Spirit (make sure you Provoke it or you'll be sorry), Machea, Master Coeurl
(capture one of these by all means!!!), Master Tonberry (wait until it gets
close, then unload on it) and Varuna. Capture one of each for Vorban. Now that
all area creations are unlocked, you also get access to Neslug.

Return to arena and get these prizes:
- for Catoblepas you get Blossom Crown (needed for Magus Sisters)
- for Shinryu you get 30x Megalixir
- for Abaddon you get 99x Lunar Curtain
- for Varuna you get 60x Designer Wallet
- for Neslug you get 99x Winning Formula

With this Step 1 of this informator is complete. You're ready for step 2.

************************************************************
STEP 2 - THREE SELECTED CHARACTERS LEARN IMPORTANT ABILITIES
************************************************************

It is time to choose the party that will take care of those nasty overpowered
enemies. As stated before, I suggest Rikku, Auron and Kimahri, all with their
fully powered celestial weapons. If you have Anima and Magus Sisters, switch
Kimahri out for Yuna. If you don't have Anima and Magus Sisters, Yuna will act
as a backup in certain tough 'events'.

Which abilities do I deem important?
Esuna, Full-Life, Hastega, Slowga, Shell, Protect, Reflect, Dispel, Holy, Auto-
Life, Steal, Use, Entrust, Copycat, Quick Pockets, Doublecast, Bribe, Triple
Foul, Delay Buster, Full Break, Mug and Quick Hit.

Getting the cash
- sell off all of the excessive weaponry and armor you might have collected on
your journey and you don't need anymore
- equip Rikku with her Godhand (this is her best weapon I'm sure you've gotten
already) or in case you don't have one yet, customize any weapon with two free
slots with Gillionare (use 30x Designer Wallet you got not long ago) and First
Strike
- go to O. Ruins and save at nearby save sphere
- start circling around here and keep falling into random battles
- make sure Rikku (and First Striker) is (are) in frontline party
- most of fights are VS 1x Zaurus and 1x chest (it can be a Mimic)
- make sure you have Rikku Steal from the chest; if it says 'Nothing to
steal.', chest turns into one of four shapes of a Mimic
- defeat this bastard and you'll get 100000 gil
- Rikku must be in winning party or you won't get cash bonus
- for starters you'll need around 4000000 gil

Getting the hard-to-reach abilities for Rikku, Auron and Kimahri (Yuna)
WAY 1:
- head to monster arena
- pay to fight Master Coeurl
- Bribe it 130000+ gil for one Warp Sp. (you'll need about 15 of them)
- now pay to fight Coeurl
- Bribe it 60000+ gil for Friend Sp. (need about 45 of them)
- get 99 Ability Spheres
- now use Warp Sp. to warp to Full-Life node and use Ability Sp. to have Rikku
learn Full-Life
- now have Auron use Friend Sp. to teleport to Rikku's location and use Ability
Sp. to learn Full-Life (do the same for Kimahri, Yuna, or both)
- repeat the process of warpin' and stuff for these abilities: Auto-Life,
Copycat, Quick Pockets, Doublecast and Full Break

WAY 2:
- slaughter heaps of Cactuars so that you gain large amounts of AP with which
you can cross the grid
- alternatively, you can kill lots of Great Malboros or Master Tonberries for
two huge AP boosts
- another alternative to get lots of AP is AP gaining trick (press CTRL + F,
type in A840A, and press ENTER)
- to get lock spheres with which you remove the locks at SG, you need to do a
bit of Bribing again: for Lv.1 Bribe Imp, for Lv.2 Bribe Behemoth, for Lv.3
Bribe Demonolith, for Lv.4 Bribe Chimera Brain
- the rest of the stuff is accomplished much the same as previous way

Learning the rest of important abilities
- according to abilities left (Esuna, Hastega, Slowga, Shell, Protect, Reflect,
Dispel, Holy, Steal, Use, Entrust, Bribe, Triple Foul, Delay Buster, Mug and
Quick Hit) you'll need 24 Wht Mag Sp., 12 Special Sp., and 12 Skill Sp.
- you can get Wht Mag Sp. by Bribing Dark Flan
- Special Sp. will be yours when Adamantoise is Bribed
- Skill Sp. are handed to you by Bribing Zu
- finding all of these guys is not hard, since we already captured one of each
when we were questing after area creations
- if in need of more cash, return to O. Ruins and continue slaughtering Mimics

Second step in accomplishing the task is complete. Although I've singled out
three (four) chrs, the others will get their turn once the selected chrs finish
their route across the SG.

*************************************************
STEP 3 - GETTING READY TO FIGHT SPECIES CREATIONS
*************************************************

Now you need to unlock species creations. To do so you'll now have to revisit
each of the 13 areas and capture following amounts of stuff in order to have
Species conquest entry in the end look like this:
- Fenrir - capture at least 3 of each: Dingo, Mi'ihen Fang, Garm, Snow Wolf,
Sand Wolf, Skoll, Bandersnatch.
- Ornitholestes - capture at least 3 of each: Dinonix, Ipiria, Raptor,
Melusine, Iguion, Yowie, Zaurus.
- Pteryx - capture at least 4 of each: Condor, Simurgh, Alcyone.
- Hornet - capture at least 4 of each: Killer Bee, Bite Bug, Wasp, Nebiros.
- Vidatu - capture at least 4 of each: Gandarewa, Aerouge, Imp.
- One-Eye - capture at least 4 of each: Floating Eye, Buer, Evil Eye, Ahriman,
Floating Death.
- Jumbo Flan - capture at least 3 of each: Water Flan, Thunder Flan, Snow Flan,
Ice Flan, Flame Flan, Dark Flan.
- Nega Elemental - capture at least 3 of each: Yellow Element, White Element,
Red Element, Gold Element, Blue Element, Dark Element, Black Element.
- Tanket - capture at least 3 of each: Raldo, Bunyip, Murussu, Mafdet, Shred,
Halma.
- Fafnir - capture at least 4 of each: Vouivre, Lamashtu, Kusariqqu, Mushussu,
Nidhogg.
- Sleep Sprout - capture at least 5 of each: Funguar, Thorn, Exoray.
- Bomb King - capture at least 5 of each: Bomb, Grenade, Puroboros.
- Juggernaut - capture at least 5 of each: Dual Horn, Valaha, Grendel.
- Ironclad - capture 10 of each: Iron Giant, Gemini A, Gemini B.

IMPORTANT: Remember, you currently DON'T need Clear Spheres yet.

Additionally, by unlocking two species creations Greater Sphere is also
unlocked. For six species creations open you get to fight Th'uban.

After this feast is complete return to the arena to collect your rewards, which
are:
- for unlocking Fenrir you get 99x Chocobo Feather
- for unlocking Ornitholestes you get 99x Stamina Spring
- for unlocking Pteryx you get 99x Mega Phoenix
- for unlocking Hornet 60x Mana Tonic
- for unlocking Vidatu 99x Mana Spring
- for unlocking One-Eye 60x Stamina Tablet
- for unlocking Jumbo Flan 60x Twin Stars
- for unlocking Nega Elemental 99x Star Curtain
- for unlocking Tanket 99x Gold Hourglass
- for unlocking Fafnir 99x Purifying Salt
- for unlocking Sleep Sprout 99x Healing Spring
- for unlocking Bomb King 60x Turbo Ether
- for unlocking Juggernaut 99x Light Curtain
- for unlocking Ironclad 60x Mana Tablet
- for unlocking Greater Sphere 60x Supreme Gem
- for unlocking Th'uban 99x Gambler's Spirit
- for unlocking Ultima Buster 99x Dark Matter

*********************************
STEP 4 - FINAL STATISTIC PREPPING
*********************************

In this step I'll prep you up for upcoming battles against species creations.
You should be using Rikku with fully powered up Godhand, Auron with fully
powered up Masamune and Kimahri with fully powered up Spirit Lance (or Yuna, if
her Nirvana is fully powered).

What I'll write now may go against the common belief, but... Personally I think
that it is MUCH better that you try to cover all existing stat booster nodes on
SG *before* you take on any of newly created monsters in the arena. Sure, if
you have Yuna and all her summons, job is easy in this case, but many first
time FFX: PAL players forget to get Destruction Sp. treasures in the temples
and are later unable to win it back cos of certain would-be-tough guys. I have
had that experience.
Also, I don't think that raising HP above 24000 HP is necessary. 20000 or so HP
is more then enough until further notice. Forget about raising MP behind 999 MP
- this value will more than suffice.

The below chart took a little bit of work, but boy, if I didn't have time...
I'll present a chart with starting stats of playable chrs:

      Tidus   Rikku   Lulu   Yuna   Wakka   Kimahri   Auron
HP    520     360     380    475    618     644       1030

------------------------------------------------------------
Eva   10      5       40     30     5       5         5
------------------------------------------------------------
Acc   10      5       3      3      25      5         3

After all stat nodes on ESG are activated, this is how Lulu's stats looked
like:
HP,   St,   Df,   Mg,   Mf,   MP,   Ag,   Lu,   Ev,   Ac
9999  161   139   160   147   999   151   31    152   70

So, what are the exact increases in every stat? The answer is in the below
chart. I'll list the after-stat, and subtract before-stat to get increase-stat.
Complicated? Naah.

        Before-stat          After-stat          Increase-stat
HP      380                  9999                9619
--------------------------------------------------------------

Mdef    30                   147                 117
--------------------------------------------------------------
MP      92                   999                 907
--------------------------------------------------------------
Agi     5                    151                 146
--------------------------------------------------------------
Luck    17                   31                  14
--------------------------------------------------------------
Eva     40                   152                 112
--------------------------------------------------------------
Acc     3                    70                  67

Note: HP and MP are increased waaaay more cos of sea of HP and MP nodes that
are on SG. But where are those additional HP and MP, you ask? You need Break HP
Limit and Break MP Limit armor abilities for that. Don't worry tho', game
remembers all HP and MP. When you get those two abilities I mentioned, HP and
MP will be properly displayed. With all HP nodes on SG activated chrs' HP end
up somewhere around 20000 (when Tidus reached 9999, I counted 51 more HP nodes
before they were all activated).

Now I'll provide the stats your chrs can have when all of the existing stat
nodes have been activated, not counting the spheres you may have gotten and
used already.

Eva   122     117     152    142    117     117       117
------------------------------------------------------------
Acc   77      72      70     70     92      72        70

This looks much better than before, but when comparing these stats to those of
standard SG, you'll notice that stat increases are smaller.

After everything is covered, ie all abilities learned, all stat nodes activated
and all Lock nodes removed, you will have 277 empty nodes left. Memorize this
number and in the continuing lines you will see how to best employ them. First
we'll want to max Strength.

*****************************
STEP 5 - FIRST ARMOR PREPPING
*****************************

Make three armors (purchase them from Wantz in Macalania forest) for Auron,
Rikku and Kimahri (or Yuna) with Auto-Haste (Bribe Machea for Chocobo Wings),
Auto-Protect (defeat Fafnir, steal from Tanket for Light Curtains) and Auto-
Phoenix (Bribe Ghost for Mega Phoenixes).
First armor is prepped and ready to use. So equip Rikku with Godhand, Auron
with Masamune and Kimahri with Spirit Lance (Yuna with Nirvana) - all these
weapons must be fully powered up. Don't forget to equip newly created armors!
Also remember that Kimahri's and Rikku's best weapons deal more damage at full
HP, whilst Auron's deals more damage, lower he is on HP.

************************
STEP 6 - MAXING STRENGTH
************************

Increase Strength first. You'll need to waste Juggernaut. He has 1200000 HP and
needs to be dealt a finishing blow over 15000 damage to get an Overkill. He
drops 1x Strength Sp. (2x for Overkill). For strategy on him look into section
36, Step 6.

POST-JUGGERNAUT-BATTLE-SPHERE-GRID-INFORMATOR

- Lowest Str stat is 161 of Lulu and Yuna. This means you're gonna need 24
Strength Sp. in order to reach max Str stat for all seven chrs. Proceed in
killing Jugi until you have that much. Lay waste upon SG using 24 Strength Sp.
you've just received and Str stat for all chrs is at 255 finally. If you need
lots of Power Sp. fast, engage in battle against Kottos, feed him one Power
Distiller and Overkill him to receive 40x Power Sp.
- Empty nodes remaining: 253 empty nodes.
- Next stat target: Defence
- but uhhh, there is an obstacle in the way, as Tanket causes Berserk... before
you nail him, we'll need another armor piece

***************************
BY-STEP 6 - FAFNIR OVERKILL
***************************

Fafnir is another creation that has set attack pattern, therefore this is why I
recommend fighting it for Light Curtains (you need those for Auto-Protect). He
has 1100000 HP and needs to be dealt finishing blow worth over 13000 in order
to get Overkill. He drops 20x Light Curtain (40x for Overkill). For strategy on
him look into section 36, By-step 6.

***************************
STEP 7 - SECOND ARMOR PIECE
***************************

Purchase another three armors from Wantz / defeat Adamantoise (or Varuna) to
receive empty 4-slot armor. Buying from Rin on airship is not recommended
anymore, so I urge you to resort to these two ways.
What shall we integrate in this armor? This time we have four slots to work
around with. In one integrate Auto-Haste (Bribe Machea for Chocobo Wings), in
second Deathproof (Bribe Epaaj for Farplane Winds), in third Berserkproof
(Bribe Raldo for Hypello Potions), in fourth Confuseproof (Bribe Floating Eye
for Musks). This armor will help us in getting Defence and Agility to the max.
IMPORTANT: Purchase additional armor piece for Auron! Extremely important! In
first slot integrate Ribbon using 99x Dark Matters you got if you were bothered
enough to unlock Ultima Buster. If you don't have them yet, or have
insifficient amount of them, save them for later.

***********************
STEP 8 - MAXING DEFENCE
***********************

For Defence maxing make sure you equip armor which we lastly created, ie the
one containing Deathproof, Berserkproof and Confuseproof, as you need to fight
Berserk inflicting Tanket.

He has 900000 HP and needs to be dealt finishing blow worth over 10000 in order
to get Overkill. He drops 1x Defence Sp. (2x for Overkill). For strategy on him
look into section 36, Step 8.

POST-TANKET-BATTLE-SPHERE-GRID-INFORMATOR

- Lowest Def stat is 136 of Yuna. This means you're gonna need 30 Defence Sp.
in order to reach max Def stat for all seven chrs. Proceed in killing Tanket
until you have that much. Lay waste upon SG using 30 Defence Sp. you've just
received and Def stat for all chrs is at 255 finally. If you need lots of Power
Sp. fast, engage in battle against Kottos, feed him one Power Distiller and
Overkill him to receive 40x Power Sp.
- Empty nodes remaining: 223 empty nodes.
- Next stat target: Accuracy

************************
STEP 9 - MAXING ACCURACY
************************

For Accuracy maxing make sure you equip armor which we lastly created, ie the
one containing Deathproof, Berserkproof and Confuseproof. For this battle
Deathproof and Confuseproof will be helpful.

Hornet has 620000 HP and needs to be dealt finishing blow worth 99999 in order
to get Overkill. He drops 1x Accuracy Sp. (2x for Overkill). For strategy on
him look into section 36, Step 9.

POST-HORNET-BATTLE-SPHERE-GRID-INFORMATOR

- Lowest Acc stat is 70 of Lulu and Yuna. This means you're gonna need 47
Accuracy Sp. in order to reach max Acc stat for all seven chrs. Proceed in
killing Hornet until you have that much. After each Hornet battle remember to
visit SG to use Accuracy Sp. you've just won in order to improve Acc for next
Hornet battle, eventually allowing you to hit him with no problem. Also
remember laying waste upon SG until 47 Accuracy Sp. are used and Acc stat for
all chrs is at 255 finally. If you need lots of Speed Sp. fast, engage in
battle against Kottos, feed him one Speed Distiller and Overkill him to receive
40x Speed Sp.
- Empty nodes remaining: 176 empty nodes.
- Next stat target: Agility

************************
STEP 10 - MAXING AGILITY
************************

For Agility maxing make sure you equip armor which we lastly created, ie the
one containing Deathproof, Berserkproof and Confuseproof. Confuseproof will
take care of nasty things.

Warning! Currently Fenrir is faster than all of your chrs... or is he? Thanks
to Auto-Haste you're ensured that your chrs will be getting one or two turns
for each of Fenrir's. He has 850000 HP and needs to be dealt finishing blow
worth 99999 in order to get Overkill. He drops 1x Agility Sp. (2x for
Overkill). For strategy on him look into section 36, Step 10.

POST-FENRIR-BATTLE-SPHERE-GRID-INFORMATOR

- Lowest Agi stat is 151 of Lulu and Auron. This means you're gonna need 26
Agility Sp. in order to reach max Agi stat for all seven chrs. Proceed in
killing Fenrir until you have that much. After each Fenrir battle remember to
visit SG to use Agility Sp. you've just won in order to improve Agi for next
Fenrir battle, eventually allowing you to hit him more times he can imagine.
Also remember laying waste upon SG until 26 Agility Sp. are used and Agi stat
for all chrs is at 255 finally. If you need lots of Speed Sp. fast, engage in
battle against Kottos, feed him one Speed Distiller and Overkill him to receive
40x Speed Sp.
- Empty nodes remaining: 150 empty nodes.
- Next stat target: Magic Defence
- One-Eye has multi-target multi-status inflicting attack... news that you and
I don't like. Maybe you're thinking that we'll create new armor for him. If you
want to, go for it. I'll provide another section dedicated to creating armor
piece just for One-Eye battles. For those that would like to skip making
another armor, I have a little trick as well.

******************************
BY-STEP 10 - THIRD ARMOR PIECE
******************************

One-Eye's Shockwave inflicts magic type damage along with Confuse, Sleep,
Silence, Darkness and Slow. Silence and Darkness are hardly of being dangerous,
but we need to take care of other three.
Head to Wantz's again and purchase another three armors with four empty slots.
In the slots input Confuseproof (Bribe Floating Eyes for Musks), Sleepproof
(Bribe Skoll for Dream Powders) and Slowproof (Bribe Mushussu for Gold
Hourglasses). Leave fourth slot empty for now. Why not Auto-Haste instead of
Slowproof? I think it's a waste. Your chrs have 255 Agi and when you compare
this to One-Eye's Agi of 38, it makes you laugh.

******************************
STEP 11 - MAXING MAGIC DEFENCE
******************************

For Magic Defence maxing make sure you equip armor which we lastly created, ie
the one containing Slowproof, Sleepproof and Confuseproof, or make sure Auron
is equipped with Masamune.

Warning! One-Eye has extremely high probability of ambushing you, in which case
you will get struck with Shockwave (injects Confuse, Sleep, Silence, Darkness
and Slow). One-Eye has 150000 HP and needs to be dealt finishing blow worth
over 15000 in order to get Overkill. He drops 1x Magic Defence Sp. (2x for
Overkill). For strategy on him look into section 36, Step 11.

POST-ONE-EYE-BATTLE-SPHERE-GRID-INFORMATOR

- Lowest Mdef stat is 122. Strangely, all boys have that much. This means
you're gonna need 34 Magic Defence Sp. in order to reach max Mdef stat for all
seven chrs. Proceed in killing One-Eye until you have that much. After each
One-Eye battle remember to visit SG to use Magic Defence Sp. you've just won in
order to improve Mdef for next One-Eye battle, slowly but surely decreasing the
damage he can do to you with Shockwave. Also remember laying waste upon SG
until 32 Magic Defence Sp. are used and Mdef stat for all chrs is at 255
finally. If you need lots of Mana Sp. fast, engage in battle against Kottos,
feed him one Mana Distiller and Overkill him to receive 40x Mana Sp.
- Empty nodes remaining: 116 empty nodes.
- Next stat target: Evasion

IMPORTANT: One-Eye can be your richest cash-cow so far. He frequently drops
three slotted Triple AP weapons, which can be sold for 67000+ gil. Since you
can dispose of him in two attacks, I'd recommend switching to this money
earning, as I bet you're tired of seeing Mimics already.

************************
STEP 12 - MAXING EVASION
************************

For Evasion maxing equip first armor we created, ie the one containing Auto-
Phoenix, Auto-Haste and Auto-Protect.

Pteryx also has extremely high probability of ambushing you, in which case you
will get struck with Beak of Woe (Curses!). Pteryx has 100000 HP and needs to
be dealt finishing blow worth 99999 in order to get Overkill. He drops 1x
Evasion Sp. (2x for Overkill). For strategy on him look into section 36, Step
12.

POST-PTERYX-BATTLE-SPHERE-GRID-INFORMATOR

- Lowest Eva stat is 117. Rikku, Auron, Wakka and Kimahri are guilty. This
means you're gonna need 35 Evasion Sp. in order to reach max Eva stat for all
seven chrs. Proceed in killing Pteryx until you have that much. Remember laying
waste upon SG until 32 Evasion Sp. are used and Eva stat for all chrs is at 255
finally. If you need lots of Speed Sp. fast, engage in battle against Kottos,
feed him one Speed Distiller and Overkill him to receive 40x Speed Sp.
- Empty nodes remaining: 81 empty nodes.
- Next stat target: Luck
- Why Luck next and not Magic? Personally I think Magic is completely useless
stat to max in FFX. You will fight toughest enemies of the game with pure
strength and skills that involve raw power. Rare occassions that will force you
to rely on magic power will be narrowed down to reviving with Life or Full-
Life, curing status ailments with Esuna or Dispel, and maybe occassional
Hastega or Slowga. But you know, there are other ways that do the job better,
you just need time and will to know where to look for it. Casting attack magic
is fairly useless for two things: it doesn't pay off as toughest enemies have
high magic defence and I don't want to see Ultima for x-times, where x equals
split infinity. I forgot to add that you need to fight Jumbo Flan in order to
get Magic Sp. It's 'pure' coincidence he can only be damaged by magic. No
thanks, I'll pass on that. That's why.

**************************
STEP 13 - PART-MAXING LUCK
**************************

Yep, you read correctly. After all 255 you've seen Luck will be raised only
partly until further notice. There are two reasons to do this: You need to
fight Greater Sp. for Luck Sp. and Earth Eater for Fortune Sp. Furthermore, you
need one Fortune Sp. per one activation of Luck +4 node. Meaning? One Luck +4
node can only be fully activated with 7 Fortune Sp. Man, imagine the number of
Earth Eaters you'll have to kill.

Getting Luck Spheres
You'll need to engage VS Greater Sphere. While I have an easy strat for him,
you'll get bored easily, so make sure you're listening to some music. For
starters I would like to aim for 100 Luck stat for three chrs (or four... you
know, Yuna and Kimahri stuff, blah blah), just enough that you have little to
no problems wasting first four dark aeons.

Equip first armor we created prior to battle, ie the one containing Auto-
Phoenix, Auto-Haste and Auto-Protect. Greater Sphere packs 1500000 HP, with
99999 worth of damage counting for an Overkill. He drops 1x Luck Sphere (2x for
an Overkill). For strategy on him look into section 36, Step 13.

Getting Fortune Spheres...?
I really really don't recommend doing this if you don't have Tidus or Wakka
with their fully powered best weapons. Multi-hit overdrives are a must against
Earth Eater. He can be killed with chrs I suggested to use throughout maxing-
the-stats process, ie Rikku, Auron and Kimahri, but it'll take another millenia
before you gather enough Fortune Spheres. Unfortunately, you will have to deck
few Earth Eaters in order to get Fortune Sp., needed to activate Luck nodes.

Getting Attribute Spheres
Again we take shelter in Bribing. You will need 34 Attribute Sp. in case Yuna
can already be part of battle party with fully powered Nirvana, or 51 Attribute
Sp. in case Yuna can't be part of battle party yet. Enemy to look for is
Maelspike, who can be Bribed for Attribute Sp. You will need about 8000000 gil
for this small feast (kill One-Eye and then sell weapons he drops or fight
Mimics in O. Ruins; additionally sell off all weapons and armors you got from
fighting previous creations). Bribe Maelspike with 100001 gil and then keep
giving it 1 gil until it goes away. Of course remember to save before any
Bribes are made.

POST-GREATER-SPHERE-AND-MAELSPIKE-BATTLE-SPHERE-GRID-INFORMATOR

- We'll raise Yuna's, Kimahri's, Rikku's and Auron's Luck to 100 with 18 Luck
Sp. you'll need to wrestle from Greater Sphere. Then have one of those chrs use
one Fortune Sp. for each Luck node that was newly created, and have the rest of
chrs use Attribute Sp. to activate the nodes. Luck is now 100, enough to waste
Dark Valefor and Dark Shiva with a little to no difficulty.
- Empty nodes remaining: 63 empty nodes.

***************************************
STEP 14 - YUNA 'ALMOST' ENTERS THE FRAY
***************************************

Before continuing I deem it is now time that Kimahri will be forced to step out
of the field and let Yuna enter occassionally. All of her stats are now at 255
sans Luck and Magic (you don't need latter anyway).
First thing to do is enter the airship. Input the coordinates for Baaj Temple:
X between 11 and 16, Y between 57 and 63. Enter newly discovered destination.
Go up the screen and fall into the water. Kill Gesgaeno who appears with one
hit.:) If you killed him before, much better. While still in the water, swim
north to reach the interior of Baaj temple. After climbing some steps you'll
reach Antechamber with six statues.
Top left belongs to Besaid, middle left Macalania, bottom left Zanarkand, top
right Bevelle, middle right Djose and bottom right Kilika. By approaching the
statue it will light up, meaning you broke the seal for respective temple. BTW,
Bevelle statue will light up automatically, there's *no way* you could've
missed that one.
This means we can now get all of Destruction Sp. from all the temples (except
Bevelle one, which we were forced to collect in order to be able to exit it).
- Kilika temple, Djose temple and Zanarkand temple will let you extract
Destruction Sp. with no problems
- you will run into flying problem when trying to approach Besaid temple and
you will run into speedy problem when trying to approach Macalania temple

************************************************
BY-STEP 14 - WASTING DARK VALEFOR AND DARK SHIVA
************************************************

Prior to Dark Valefor battle equip first armor we created, ie the one
containing Auto-Phoenix, Auto-Haste and Auto-Protect.
Valefor packs 800000 HP and needs to be dealt finishing blow worth 99999 in
order to get Overkill. He drops 1x Dark Matter (2x for Overkill). For strategy
on him look into section 36, By-step 14.

IMPORTANT: Remember before when I suggested of purchasing additional four-
slotted armor piece for Auron? You must have 99x Dark Matters by now, cos I'm
definitely sure you collected that much of them from killing monster arena
creations. Auron's next armor will contain Ribbon (99x Dark Matter), Auto-Haste
(Bribe Machea for Chocobo Wings), Auto-Protect (defeat Fafnir for Light
Curtains) and Deathproof (Bribe Epaaj for Farplane Winds).

Prior to Dark Shiva battle equip first armor piece we created, ie one
containing Auto-Haste, Auto-Protect and Auto-Phoenix. Equip Auron with lastly
created armor!!! Don't attempt to fight Dark Shiva without that armor.
She's fast! That's why you need 255 Agiliti and Auto-Haste. Following is info
on damage estimates done to party at max stats without Shell and Protect in
place: 'kick' deals 6000 damage, Heavenly Strike deals about 10000 damage, and
Diamond Dust 85000 damage to all (cannot be halved in any way). She's also
dangerous cos of her Quick Hit ability, as you will see in CTB window when in
battle against her. For strategy on her look into section 36, By-step 14.

Guado attack! Run from these guys all the way to the right so that you enter
screen called 'Lake Macalania: Crevasse'. Once here, return to Macalania temple
entrance and you can now enter without problem.

All of the Destruction Sp. have been collected! Now return to Baaj temple and
grab your Anima.

******************************************
STEP 15 - YUNA ENTERS THE FRAY PERMANENTLY
******************************************

Now that temple fun is behind us, few things await us. For Yuna we still need
to get two of her summons - Yojimbo (in case you don't have him already) and
Magus Sisters. You have to get Yojimbo first.

Getting Yojimbo
We'll visit Cavern of S. F. again. Remember Tonberry and you'll know straight
away where it is located. Go to very back of the cavern, where you'll meet
someone from Lulu's past. This someone will summon Yojimbo, who will engage in
battle against your party. Do I need to mention how pathetically easy he is
when compared to your 255 stats? One strike from any member will send him on
the floor (if only I could kill that annoying dog).
After the battle you'll visit Antechamber where Yojimbo will ask you what do
you wish from him. Answer something, then hand over 300000 gil and he's yours
to command in future battles.

Getting Magus Sisters
For these gals you'll need to visit Remiem temple (east exit from Calm lands,
accessible only with chocobo). Enter the temple and you'll find Belgemine. Talk
to her. Her too...? Accept her challenge, which is besting her in eight levels
of Tetris. You can't choose level eight right from the start, you'll have to
work your way up gradually. After you defeat level five, you win Flower
Scepter. If you got Anima, level seven is now accessible. Best it. If you got
Yojimbo, level six is now accessible. Best it as well.
This is it! Now approach the strange door behind Belgemine and you will be able
to enter. When Yuna exits, Magus Sisters are yours. Talk to Belgemine again and
level eight is now accessible. Best that as well, and finally say farewell to
Belgemine who will go where she belongs. Moon sigil is yours at last, meaning
Yuna's Nirvana is about to be at peak of its power!

**************************************
STEP 16 - PRE-FINAL STATISTIC OVERVIEW
**************************************

It's time I present you with another chart showing you stats of all seven chrs.

Acc   255     255     255    255    255     255       255

****************************************
STEP 17 - PRE-FINAL SPHERE GRID OVERVIEW
****************************************

There's still 63 empty nodes remaining on SG that can be filled with something.
One part of that something I suggest you pour into 38 Luck Sp., with which Luck
stat will reach 255 value (but it isn't needed!).
Yes, I am aware that having 255 Luck, Evasion and Accuracy is not needed.
Y'see, you can have one of the following:
- either you have 150 Luck, 255 Eva and 255 Acc
- or you have 255 Luck, 150 Eva and 150 Acc
... and you'll get roughly same results. But tell me, doesn't it fill you with
feeling of completion when you take a look at status screen and you see nothing
but 255? Well, in my stat maxing guide everything but Mag.
Subtracting that will come into running total of 25 empty nodes still remaining
on SG. You're left to do with them as you please, but many players go for HP
nodes (get them from killing Ironclad in species creation list). If you
absolutely must have Mag at 255, you'll need 28 Magic Sp. (get them from
killing Jumbo Flan). Hm, it appears we ran out of space.

*****************************************
STEP 18 - WASTING IRONCLAD AND JUMBO FLAN
*****************************************

Prior to Ironclad battle equip first armor we created, ie the one containing
Auto-Phoenix, Auto-Haste and Auto-Protect. If Yuna doesn't have it yet, make
one for her. For Auron stick to his Ribbon armor we have made.

Ironclad is a nice guy. He has a set attack pattern, 2000000 HP and counters
anything. He needs to be dealt finishing blow worth 99999 in order to get
Overkill. He drops 1x HP Sp. (2x for Overkill). For strategy on him look into
section 36, Step 18.

Now that we have a bunch of HP nodes, stick them into remaining 25 empty nodes
on ESG. For those that are aching in magic field, here's a brief entry for
Jumbo Flan. For those that don't care about magic, skip to Step 19.

Prior to Jumbo Flan battle equip first armor we created, ie the one containing
Auto-Phoenix, Auto-Haste and Auto-Protect. If Yuna doesn't have it yet, make
one for her. For Auron stick to his Ribbon armor we have made.

Jumbo Flan is not a nice guy - he's immune to any physical attack (funnily
Overdrives deal damage to him), and he can only be harmed by magic. He has
1300000 HP and needs to be dealt finishing blow worth 99999 to gain Overkill.
He drops 1x Magic Sp. (2x for Overkill). For strategy on him look into section
36, Step 18.

POST-IRONCLAD-AND-JUMBO-FLAN-BATTLE-SPHERE-GRID-INFORMATOR

- You have 63 empty nodes remaining.
- Personally I'm mostly leaning onto having all stats at 255 except Mag and
Luck. Luck IMO is sufficient enough to be at 160. You will be able to kill
everything in the game with that stats. Yes, all dark aeons and Penance. True,
you may still miss with physical attacks against some of later dark aeons
(Magus Sisters), but I've done my best to find out strategies which allow you
to beat them very easily (for example, my Dark Bahamut, Dark Magus Sisters and
Penance strategies).

***********************************
STEP 19 - FINAL STATISTICS OVERVIEW
***********************************

First chart is based on my preferred final stats: all stats at 255 except Mag
and Luck. Leave Magic stat as it is (ie raised only with Mag +1, 2, 3 or 4
nodes already integrated into SG) and Luck being raised onto 160.
As you have 63 empty nodes left remaining, this means you need to get 15 more
Luck Sp. Subtracting that gives us 48 empty nodes still left. Fill them with 48
HP Sp. Lying below is chart with final statistics in these cases.

      Tidus   Rikku   Lulu   Yuna   Wakka   Kimahri   Auron

Looks good, eh? I very highly recommend this ending chart! HP and MP values can
be achieved by wearing armor with Break HP Limit and Break MP Limit.

Second chart is meant for players who want to have 255 in every stat. Having so
high stats they will, but at expense of lower HP. With 63 empty nodes remaining
(and based on last stats of your chrs) you will need 38x Luck Sp., 28x Magic
Sp. (you'll run out of three slots). Lying below is a chart with final stats in
this case.

STEP 20 - HALL OF MONSTER SHAME
*******************************

Remember before we become so powerful, you tried to fight area, species and
original creations, only to see few 99999 appear on your chrs who were KO-ed?
You will now notice an *enormous* difference. Damage potential is shown in
section 36, Step 20.

****************************************************
STEP 21 - STAT MAXING CONTINUED (WITH CLEAR SPHERES)
****************************************************

In case you fall into class of people that likes having neatly organized SG,
you've come just to the right section. In here I shall guide you through
tormenting way of buying Clear Spheres, clearing the crappy nodes, installing +
4 nodes, buying more Clear Sphere, more clearing, more installing... sometime
during this 1000 Don Tonberries will get killed... Anyway, it'll be boring for
a while. There are few pre-steps you'll have to read thru.

****************************
STEP 24 - CLEAR SPHERES INFO
****************************

Clear Spheres are items you'll now be buying like mad, since we need to delete
many crappy nodes in order to organize the SG neatly.
First step in getting Clear Spheres is capturing five of every fiend. Doing
this will unlock Ultima Buster, as well as making Clear Spheres appear in Item
shop of arena manager. One Clear Sphere will relieve you of 10000 gil. Clear
Spheres can remove any node from SG except: Lock nodes, White and Black Magic
nodes, Skill nodes and Special ability nodes.
In next step I'll make another chart showing how many nodes from each stat
category you'll need to delete exactly, making necessary adjustments. Do not
attempt to delete anything yet! Take that chart only as an info corner to see
what you'll need to do.

you clear crappy Magic nodes last cos of Jumbo Flan's extremely annoying
ability of not being harmed by physical attacks.

STEP 26 - CHARACTER'S STATISTICS OVERVIEW BEFORE CLEAR SPHERE-ING
*****************************************************************

This part is of informative type as well. I will list here the stats your
characters would have in *case all of the crappy nodes would have been
deleted*. Doing so will help you and me calculate just how much spheres of each
type you'll need to get to install them into SG, thus making SG consist only of
+4 nodes. Anyway, first are stats with Luck of 160 and Mag not being touched at
all, the rest are stats that are left only with +4 nodes, and all that remained
are deleted.

STEP 27 - CALCULATING AMOUNT OF SPHERES YOU NEED FOR EACH STAT
**************************************************************

Another two-part subpart, I'm afraid. Two calculations have been done, based on
stats of each stat maxing process I suggested. First, as usual, will be stat
maxing guide with Luck of 160 and Mag not being changed (256 empty nodes).

- for HP you won't need any spheres, but you can accrue 164x HP Sp. if you wish
to have an enormous HP
- for MP you won't need any spheres
- for STR you'll need 17x Strength Sp.
- for DEF you'll need 23x Defence Sp.
- for MAG you won't need any spheres
- for MDEF you'll need 12x Magic Def Sp.
- for AGI you'll need 19x Agility Sp.
- for LUCK you won't need any spheres
- for EVA you'll need 9x Evasion Sp.
- for ACC you'll need 12x Accuracy Sp.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This line-up shows amount of spheres needed in case all core stats are 255 (326
empty nodes).

- for HP you can accrue up to 195x HP Sp. if you wish to have an enormous HP
- for MP you'll need 19x MP Sp.
- for STR you'll need 17x Strength Sp.
- for DEF you'll need 23x Defence Sp.
- for MAG you'll need 17x Magic Sp.
- for MDEF you'll need 12x Magic Def Sp.
- for AGI you'll need 19x Agility Sp.
- for LUCK you'll need 3x Luck Sp.
- for EVA you'll need 9x Evasion Sp.
- for ACC you'll need 12x Accuracy Sp.

************************************************
STEP 28 - FIGHTING SPECIES CREATIONS FOR SPHERES

This shouldn't take long... as long as you don't start collecting HP Sp. If
only Ironclad wouldn't counter, battles against him would go so much faster.

*****************************************
SOME LAST TIPS FOR PLAYERS WITH HP GROOVE
*****************************************

Well, this section deserves HP shootout up to 99999 HP without having an armor
with HP+??% abilities in it... however, on ESG achieving this much HP will take
a lot of sacrifice.
If you take a look at stat maxing guide - 160 Luck and Magic untamed - you
prolly know what I'm saying from beginning... Magic sucks! So successfully get
rid of all Magic nodes - 45 nodes in total. Replace them with 45x HP Sp. for
another (calculates) 13500 HP added to current total, thus making chrs have
around 80000 HP already.

      Tidus   Rikku   Lulu   Yuna   Wakka   Kimahri   Auron
HP    77620   77460   77480  77575  77718   77744     78130

You're gonna need a huge resupply of 76 more HP Sp. in case you wish to have
99999 HP for all chrs... but just how the hell can you accomplish that? I don't
have any easy solution for it. You will have to sacrifice some of +4 nodes if
you wish to have 99999 HP without the need for HP+??% armors. Which nodes to
erase I leave up to your discretion.

************************************
STATS GO IN HAND WITH GOOD EQUIPMENT
************************************

I see you're still around. *thinks* What the heck did I forget to put down? A
good weapon and armor suggestion, you say? Why not.

It's a common belief (at least I get that impression) that it's good to have
enormous amounts of HP and MP as well as 255-ish stats. Well, personally I
believe this is not so. Let me explain why...
Having huge amounts of HP is not good. You will need to spend many turns
healing in prolonged battles (Nemesis and Penance, for example). Amount of HP
also directly relates to amount of damage celestial weapons can do (less HP
means less damage) - now imagine your chrs all have 99999 MAX HP, but their
current HP is 25000 or so; and compare to having your chrs have 9999 MAX HP,
but their current HP is 2500 or so - how many turns does each scenario require
you to heal? Latter only one.
Few sections up I made a chart showing damage area, species and original
creations can do to you once your stats have been maxed. With few exceptions
most attacks deal way less than 9999 damage - which makes having HP over 9999
hardly a necessity. Even for dark aeons you will not need that much HP (strats
I have for earlier dark aeons do recommend HP over 9999, but at the expense of
not having 255 stats).

Let's take a look first over armor abilities game has to offer. You can choose
from 74 different armor abilities. I'll single out the ones worth having.

Deathproof, Auto-Shell, Auto-Protect, Auto-Haste, Auto-Phoenix, Master Thief,
No Encounters, Break HP Limit, Ribbon...
Out of 74 we have 9 trustworthy abilites left. The remaining 65 do suck and you
don't need them.
Good armor or best armor? A tough fact, but there is *no* best armor. We can
make some good armors instead. Based on my experience in this game, you will
stand awesome chances against anything with following two sets of armors.

GOOD ARMOR SET 1 (meant for everyday battles)
Auto-Protect, Auto-Haste, Ribbon, Auto-Phoenix

GOOD ARMOR SET 2 (meant for prolonged battles)
Auto-Protect, Auto-Haste, Ribbon, Break HP Limit

ARMOR SET 3 (meant for anything status related, including attacks that bypass
Deathproof armor ability)
Deathproof, Ribbon, Auto-Phoenix, Auto-Haste

WHATEVER ARMOR YOU WISH
If none of these three armors I suggested suit you, feel free to make your own
preferred armor. What I do recommend is that you use abilities mentioned above.

That's all I had to say for an armored section. Only final thought remains.

*************
FINAL THOUGHT
*************

Stat maxing... With 1st November (how odd) this section lays to rest as it is
completed. Now on to other challenges still remaining.



=============================================================================
=============================================================================
XII) ABOUT BATTLE QUOTES ---> A090
=============================================================================
=============================================================================

This part of guide will be about quotes different characters say when inside
battles. Some of them are really hilarious. There's a lot of them, and all of
them are in here now. However, you can see that some quotes are still unsorted,
cos I don't yet know where they belong. If any of you readers knows where a
certain quote of those unsorted ones is said and how, send the information in!
Send it to this e-mail:

lifearmor@hotmail.com

Follow a few guidelines, please.
#1 Don't forget to put down who says the quote.
#2 If possible, add info on which occasion is the quote said.
#3 If possible, also include the proper punctuation of the quote. I'd like this
guide to be as accurate as possible.
#4 Please write in proper English.
#5 Last, don't forget to sign down the name you'd like to be credited with.

Note: This section is now complete! I've received huge contribution of quotes
from Clara, who had enough time on her hands to get them off of FFX DVD, sort
them out and send them to me. Whatever was missing from quotes in previous
updates and is now filled up, credits go to her.:)

Allow me to explain how shall I chop up single character's quote section...

1. Abilities quotes
- Listed here will be quotes that character says when executing a certain
ability. This may be white magic, skill, black magic etc.

2. Switch command quotes
- Listed here will be quotes character says once you switch him in front
fighting row during battle.

3. Overdrive quotes
- Listed here will be quotes character says when executing an Overdrive. Yuna
doesn't have Overdrive quotes section.

4. Random battles finishing quotes
- Listed here will be quotes character says at end of battle. I'll also try to
provide in which battle area it is said.

5. Random battles VS specific enemies quotes
- Listed here will be quotes character says when encountering specific enemy.

6. Random battles suggestion quotes
- Listed here will be quotes character says as a suggestion to better course of
action.

7. Revival quotes
- Listed here will be quotes character says when he or she is revived.

8. Summon quotes
- Listed here will be quotes character says when summoning an Aeon. Exclusive
to Yuna only.

And finally, here are some pointers to how can you get quotes to be said...
#1 Most of the ability quotes are said the first time when they're used by the
character. Ability used must also be on character's SG path. For example you'll
only hear Tidus' quote for Haste, but won't hear it from any other character,
because Haste is on Tidus' part of the grid. There are still some abilities for
which I can't get the characters to say the lines for.
#2 Switch command quotes are pretty easy to be heard. Just keep switching
members in battle.
#3 Same stuff would go for Overdrive quotes. Keep using them and if you're
lucky, character will say it.
#4 Ah, battle finishers? These are a bit harder to obtain. There are three main
divisions of those quotes. First division is said by random character of
victory party if all three or two chrs are in good shape (ie their health is
above 50%). Second division is said by random character of victory party if all
three or two chrs are in bad shape (KO-ed or their HP below 50%). Last division
are Game Over quotes. These are said only in specific locations and quote sayer
*must* be KO-ed last. You may KO that chr yourself or let it be killed by
enemies.
#5 Specific fiend quotes? These are the most hilarious quotes IMO. Get them by
having the quote sayer appear at start of battle against the specific fiend or
switch them in later in the battle.
#6 Said mostly in beginning stages of the game, suggestion quotes are obtained
by having a chr perform an action some other chr is more suitable for, like
Tidus attacking Flan-type fiend. Don't you worry, by each such quote I've
provided an action you do to get it.
#7 Revival quotes are another easy get. KO a chr, and use a Phoenix Down, Life
or Full-Life. Auto-Life works too.
#8 Yuna exclusively houses Summon quotes. Summon away!
#9 A special class of tutorial battle quotes is available below. If you ever
forget what they said, find out here.
#10 Then we have starter battle quotes that are related to the progress of the
story. These have been sorted out and thrown into its special class.
#11 And finally, we have boss battle quotes, said either by bosses or
characters when fighting those bosses.

Sorry, guys, there's still more I need to share.
- Ability and specific enemy quotes are said only once, and then never again.
- Ability quotes are never mentioned in boss battles.
- If certain characters are paired up in battles, they will respond to each
other quotes. Trial and error is of the essence here (hopefully you have me to
do that, heh).
- Last chances to hear Game Over quotes is right before reaching Bevelle
Temple. After that point of the game you can Game Over as much as you can, but
to my knowledge no more quotes are said that are available in this department.

...and that, as they say, is that...

H) TUTORIAL BATTLES QUOTES
**************************

1. Battle VS Dingo and Condor

Wakka: Here comes one now... Hey, why don't ya try out that sword I gave you?
*Tidus kills Dingo*
Tidus: No problem!
Wakka: Not too shabby! You kept up with him pretty good. Might make a good
guardian someday.
*Condor enters battle*
Wakka: A flyer! My kind of customer!

*if Lulu uses magic on Dingo*
Wakka: Hey, that one's not ours, remember?

2. Battle VS Water Flan

Wakka: That...looks like trouble.
Tidus: Heh! Watch this!
*Tidus strikes Water Flan*
Wakka: Told you. Only magic can beat that thing. If you can't beat them down,
you gotta use magic of an element they don't like.
Tidus: Magic? Element?
Wakka: Let's have our black mage show you what I mean. Lu! You're up!
Lulu: Clueless, aren't you? Good thing I'm here. Spells of ice work well
against fire fiends... and ice fiends are weak against fire magic. You follow?
Tidus: I get fire and ice, but what about lightning and water?
Lulu: Lightning and water are opposed, just like fire and ice. This one here's
a water fiend, which means...
*cast Water on Water Flan*
Wakka: Whoa! Hey! Why you're healing that thing for?
Lulu: This is the sort of thing that can happen if you pick the wrong element.
*cast Fire or Blizzard on Water Flan*
Lulu: Uh, that was a bad example. This one's a water fiend, so fire and ice
aren't very effective.
Wakka: Enough with the lesson, Lu. Let's get this over with, ya?

[Addendum of quotes extracted, but I can't get chrs to say them]
Lulu: Elements are the essence of both magic and fiends. Fire and ice,
lightning and water, four elements in all. The fire element and ice element are
opposed.
Lulu: The elements of fire and ice are two sides of the same coin. There are
four elements - fire, ice, lightning, and water. Fire fiends are weak against
ice magic, and ice fiends are weak against fire. Make sense?
Lulu: If you hit a water fiend with a lightning attack, it should only take one
hit.
Wakka - Uh... Having fun yet?
Wakka - Man! Just use the Thunder on that thing, ya?

3. Battle VS Garuda

Tidus: A flyer! That's your department, right?
Wakka: True, true. But, uhhh... Why don't we let our summoner show what's she's
made of.
*switch Tidus out for Yuna*
Wakka: Your first real battle! Let's see some style.
Lulu: Show us what your training has taught you, Yuna.
Yuna: Okay.

4. Battle VS Garuda

Wakka: Another one of those? No problem, leave this one to me, ya? Say
goodnight, birdie!
*if Wakka is not present at start*
Tidus: Not one of these again!
Lulu: Wakka, this is your show!

5. Battle VS Ragora

Lulu: Kimahri, why don't you use 'Lancet' on it?
Tidus: What's a 'Lancet'?
Lulu: Normally, it's a skill that weakens enemies and heals the user. But when
a Ronso uses it, that Ronso can sometimes learn fiends abilities.
Tidus: Sounds cool!

6. Battle VS Raldo (on Mi'ihen road)

Tidus: Hah! That one looks slow.
Auron: It's also tough. Let me handle this.
Tidus: No way! I can take it!
*Tidus attacks Raldo*
Tidus: What the...?
Auron: *hmph*
*Auron kills Raldo*
Wakka: Told ya, Sir Auron's the best.
Tidus: Hmph, I could've done that.

[Addendum of quotes extracted, but I can't seem to get chrs to say them]
*after Raldo is KO-ed*
Lulu: He truly is a legendary guardian.
Yuna: That was great, Sir Auron.
*in subsequent battles get Tidus to attack Raldo*
Lulu: Leave those to Sir Auron.
Auron: I told you, let me handle their kind.
Wakka: Leave those hard-shelled ones to Sir Auron.
*have Lulu try to toast Raldo*
Lulu: These ones seem resistant to magic.
Auron: Magic won't hurt their kind.
Wakka: Stop that! You'll just waste magic, ya?

7. Battle VS Treasure Box and Bunyip

Rikku: Oooh! A treasure chest! I wonder what's inside?
*Rikku steals from chest; Bunyip appears and attacks her*
Rikku: You should know, I'm scary when I get mad! I'm gonna use that item I
just got on you! You'll be sorry.
*Rikku Mixes Firestorm*
Wakka: W-What did you just do?
Tidus: That was great!
Lulu: Was that...
Auron: Not bad.
Kimahri: Kimahri does not know that skill.
Rikku: I can combine items and use them like this. It's not that tough, really.

8. Battle VS two Mech Guards
Rikku: Let me handle the machina! I can take them apart piece by piece.

K - UNSORTED QUOTES
*******************

Quotes found here were submitted by Clara. For some of them I have not yet been
able to figure out where they are said. So until I get lucky enough personally
to hear them be said in battle, they'll stick here. I received the list on 17th
October, and while I already sorted out about 2/5 of them, many remain. The
list will decrease until next update when all that remains here will be quotes
I couldn't stick anywhere (yet).

=============================================================================
=============================================================================
XIII) ABOUT AFFECTION ---> A837
=============================================================================
=============================================================================

Q1 - Lulu, dear, how about a date? Rikku, darling, care to go with me to the
movies? Yuna, shall we have a romantic dinner?
A1 - What's up with these, you ask? You may or may have not noticed, but in FFX
some of Tidus' actions and responses directly affect which female character
will like him the most and will reflect that in some sequences.

Q2 - Tidus' responses and actions? Which sequences?
A2 - I'll give one example for each.
--> For response: Before Yuna joins your party, Wakka asks you: 'Cute, ya?'. If
you answer affirmative, this will make Yuna's affection for Tidus rise. If you
answer negative, Yuna's affection for Tidus will decrease.
--> For action: In random battle have Tidus KO Yuna. This will decrease her
affection a bit. If, however, you heal or revive Yuna, this will increase her
affection a bit.
--> For sequence: First one that jumps to mind is snowmobile sequence. You can
have a ride with either Rikku or Lulu (that's the two I got so far).

Q3 - Can you list more examples like these?
A3 - Sure.
--> Just before you're about to get Rikku in your party, get past her (don't
get too close) and try going forward. Rikku will yell 'Wait up, you big
meanie!'. Oops, affection level decreased a bit.
--> Once you've visited the Farplane and Yuna is forced to choose from
Seymour's... uh, choice, repeatedly talk to Lulu and she'll warn you not to
fall in love wit Yuna. Answer that you already have for Yuna's affection to
rise. Answer 'You're more my type, Lulu.' for hilarious response by Lulu:
'Interesting. I suppose I could add you to my list. I wish you good luck,
little boy. You're going to need it.'... and increase in Lulu's affection.
Picking middle choice decreases Yuna's affection.
--> KO-ing Lulu will decrease her affection a bit. Healing or reviving Lulu
will increase her affection a bit.
--> KO-ing Rikku will decrease her affection a bit. Healing or reviving Rikku
will increase her affection a bit.
--> In Thunder Plains when Rikku is scared of lightning and moans about
spending some time in Rin's Agency, the rest of the party is slowly getting off
the screen. Longer you wait, lower will Rikku's affection be. Sooner you enter
the Agency, better off you are with Rikku's affection.
--> when in a position of talking to multiple party members, talk to female you
want highest affection with first
--> Tidus guarding (ie taking the hit instead of her) the woman of his dreams
increases that female's affection a bit

Q4 - I've read that depending on affection you can have one of females throw
the ball to Tidus...?
A4 - Yep. For Tidus' Overdrive Blitz Ace this is very true. Depending on which
gal has highest affection with Tidus dictates who will throw the ball. If Tidus
has highest affection with say Rikku, she'll be the one throwing the ball. Same
applies for Lulu and Yuna.

Q5 - I've heard that it is not always Lulu Tidus talks to when in Guadosalam
(after Farplane's events). Dat true?
A5 - Yep. I managed to get Rikku's affection be the highest at that point and
indeed another convo occured.:)

WARNING: SPOILEROOS AHEAD!

Rikku: Yunie's not getting married, is she?
Tidus: Seems that way.
Rikku: It's your big chance, huh?
*then you're offered three choices - select third one: I'd rather have you,
Rikku.*
Rikku (backs off a bit): Oh! H-Honest? (she then punches Tidus a bit)
Tidus: Ouch!
Rikku (jumps off to lower level): Syopa cusatyo! (translated: Maybe someday!)

After this convo you can talk to her two more times. She'll reveal more about
herself and her family, and how she dreams of having a big family herself
with... tsk, tsk, find out for yourself.

Added bonus: Just for an example I'll put down quote-by-quote of what Lulu or
Rikku say when they're riding on snowmobile with Tidus.

WARNING: SPOILEROOS AHEAD!

Lulu snowmobile event:
L: I hope that you're not too mad at Wakka.
T: Hey, not at all.
L: Thank you.
T: Say, what do you think of Rikku?
L: Me? She's... fun to be with.
T: That all?
L: Well, I can tell she's not a bad person.
T: Yeah. You know what the problem is? She's just another Al Bhed to Wakka.
Wakka's head is as hard as a rock. I bet it's because of Yevon. Or, you know,
something like that.
L: Well, there's more to it than that.
T: Hmm?
L: Wakka doesn't like the Al Bhed because of his brother Chappu.
T: Oh... he used a machina weapon, right? And got killed by Sin. Killed by my
old man. *thinking* Damn you, Jecht.
L *catches on Tidus' last words*: What?
T: Oh, nothing! *changes the subject* Hey... Can someone, like, a human become
Sin ever?
L: I can't say that I know, but why?
T: Just a thought.
L: Sin is the punishment for, and the incarnation of, crimes we have committed.
T: So, no one really knows what it is?
L: There's no need to know, so no one asks. You run or you fight. That is
really all you can do. There's no sense brooding over it.
T: What, that's all? I mean, you don't even wonder?
L *smiling*: You really do come from a world where there is no Sin, like you
say.

Rikku snowmobile event:
T: Sorry about Wakka.
R *tries to smile*: He didn't have to be so mean, yeah? I almost cried.
T: Uh... Rikku?
R: Just kidding! It's okay. At least you're still nice. *GO TIDUS!!!* Hey, do I
look like Yunie, you think?
T *acts confused*
R: Well, my dad's sister is Yunie's mother, you get it?
T: I had no idea! If you say so. Okay! I guess you're guarding your family,
then.
R: Yuna's not the only on I want to protect. We Al Bhed want to protect all of
the summoners, you know? Summoners are... Well, you could say that... they
sacrifice themselves to, well... to bring happiness to Spira.
T: What do you mean? Rikku?
R: Yes?
T: 'Sacrifice themselves'?
R: You know, the pilgrimage... It takes a lot out of you.
T: Oh, right. But you know, Yuna's real serious about being a summoner. For
Yuna, well the pilgrimage kinda means everything to her. You are going to help
her, too, aren't you, Rikku? So you shouldn't say that Yuna's sacrificing
herself.
R *hugs Tidus real tight*
T: Rikku?
R: I hope you're right.

XIV) TIPS & HINTS ---> A665
=============================================================================

#6 - CUSTOM CHOICE

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

II - ARMORS

Getting a good all around armor is impossible, but you can customize more of
them. And cos you can switch them during battles to suit your needs, this is
not a big deal at all. Let's talk shop then...

#1 - STATUS PROTECTION
- Ribbon
- Deathproof
- Curseproof
With this setup you'll be almost completely protected against all status
ailments except Breaks. Yep, there are few fiends that can put Break statuses
on your members.

#2 - ELEMENT PROTECTION
- Fire Eater
- Ice Eater
- Lightning Eater
- Water Eater
With this you'll absorb any type of elemental damage done to you except holy,
which is only used by Ultima Weapon and Belgemine's Cindy.

#3 - HERO WANNABE
- Break HP Limit
- Break MP Limit
- Ribbon
- Deathproof
Lots of HP, MP, hardly dies, hardly affected by statuses (except Curse). Beat
that.

#4 - PLAY SAFE, PLAY SOUND
- Auto-Shell
- Auto-Protect
- Auto-Haste
- Auto-Regen
Takes half magic and half physical damage, fast as lightning, automatic
healing.

#5 - AUTOMATIC MODE
- Auto-Potion
- Auto-Phoenix
- Auto-Med
- Alchemy
With this you'll almost always be in top shape when it comes to HP.

#6 - CUSTOM CHOICE
- Ribbon
- Auto-Phoenix
- Auto-Haste
- Auto-Protect

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

III - QUICK CASH OPTIONS

#1 - MIMICS IN OMEGA RUINS
As you may know, sometimes in O. Ruins you get into a battle with Zaurus and a
treasure chest. There's a 50% chance there'll be nothing in the chest when you
try to steal from it. If that happens, chest turns into a Mimic. Kill it and
you'll receive 50000 Gil. Coupled with Gillionare ability this sum can increase
to 100000 Gil.

#2 - ONE-EYE METHOD
Repeatedly waste One-Eye. Most of the time it drops weapons with 4 slots, one
of which is already stuck with Triple AP. Such weapon can be sold for roughly
67000+ Gil. If you're fast and strong enough to waste One-Eye in two blinks of
one eye (hehe), this method is for you.

#3 - KOTTOS METHOD (submitted by Anders B.)
Go to Kilika, buy as many armor you can, but make sure you have 6000 gil left.
Go to Calm Lands and fight Kottos for Healing Springs once. After the fight add
SOS Regen to the armor, then sell it. You end up with more money then you gave
for it. You can make 1 armor with SOS Regen this way. If you got Overkill you
can make 3 armors with SOS Regen.

In a nutshell:
37781 (price you get for selling it) - 6000 (price for fighting kottos) - 2250
(armor price) = 29531 gil
With overkill: 37781*3 - 6000 (For fighting kottos) - 2250 *3 (armor price) =
100593 gil

It takes less time then finding for money mimics.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

IV - STEALING RARE ITEMS

#1 - MASTER THIEF
You need 30x Pendulum to get this. Bribing Master Tonberry costs money. Beating
Neslug costs life. Winning with four open chests in Remiem temple chocobo race
will annoy you. There is one of a time option to get many Pendulums. Ultima
Weapon. When you get to fight it, Bribe Ultima Weapon for at least one million
gil. You'll receive around 90 Pendulums, enough for three Master Thief armors.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

V - WEEDING RIBBON ARMORS

#1 - DARK YOJIMBO FARMER
Dark Yojimbo is your man! As you may know, you have to defeat him five times
before he's gone for real. But, if you defeat him four times only, then save
your game, reset it and load it again, Yojimbo fights counter will be reset to
zero. Thus you can kill him additional four times. Need I mention that this is
a top-choice of obtaining 4-slotted Ribbon armors?
True, true, other dark aeons also drop Ribbon armors, but you need to reload
after each fight in case you didn't get what you were looking for.

#2 - BASTARD'O PENANCE
When Penance can be fought, equip chrs with First Strike weapons. Choose
Penance destination in NavMap. When battle ensues, go wild on both arms. Each
one killed will get you 1x Dark Matter (rarely 1x Master Sphere) and 10000 AP.
You can wait for an arm to be regenerated and then kill it again for additional
goodies. Once satisfied, *escape*! Don't let Penance kill you and your hard
work for nothing.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

VI - MONSTER FIGHTING TIPS AND TRICKS

#1 - KING BEHEMOTH, CATOBLEPAS
As you experienced, Kingie uses Meteor as desperation move when it dies (and
Cato uses Ultima). And I was informed of a way to bypass it. How? Tidus or
whoever has Counter-Attack weapon should know Provoke. Hack at King until its
HP is merely a fraction of what it used to be. Use Provoke on Kingie. It will
attack the Provoker. As Provoker takes damage (or evades the attack), Provoker
will counter the attack and kill King. Great thing about it is that such kill
doesn't trigger Meteor.
For Cato have the person with Counter-Attack use Sentinel in order to guard one
of Cato's attacks. Once guarded, counterattack will issue, killing Cato in the
process and you'll never see Ultima.

#2 - GREAT MALBORO
These guys love to ambush you. But having a chr with First Strike weapon and
Delay Buster skill is your saviour. When in battle against Great Malboro, use
Delay Buster on it and you'll dropkick its turn faaaar down on CTB bar, more
than enough for you to kill it.

#3 - TONBERRY, MASTER TONBERRY, DON TONBERRY
To avoid their Karma counter, either let them get close for four turns (at
which point Karma is disabled) and then unload on them, or put them to sleep
(except Don) and then use magical attacks.

#4 - DEMONOLITH
To avoid their Pharaoh's Curse counter, shut them up with Silence Buster. Once
silenced, they can't use it anymore, hehe. So just unload on them.

#5 - BOMB, GRENADE, PUROBOROS, BOMB KING
To avoid their inflating and Self-Destructing, defeat them with counter-
attacks, as these types of attacks won't cause them to inflate. Bomb King
inflates as well, but doesn't explode in the end - instead he gains access to
Ultima. Hacking at him with counters will bypass his inflating.

#6 - SPIRIT
Poison Mist is Spirit's countermove to almost anything you'll throw at it. To
get around it, cast Provoke on Spirit and it'll start using White Wind on your
party each subsequent turn it gets... until you kill it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

VII - FULL OVERDRIVE GAUGE FOR FRONTLINE PARTY IN JUST ONE BATTLE

For this tip you'll need Rikku and any other two characters. Conditions that
are to be met are that all chrs know Victor overdrive mode and have Triple
Overdrive on their weapons. Start by having Rikku Mix Eccentrick, which doubles
the charging of Overdrive gauges. After that just have remaining characters
slaughter the enemies with Overdrives. Cos of Eccentrick and Triple Overdrive
your gauges will be full at start of next battle.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

VIII - LATE BOSSES GO AAARGH IN JUST TWO ACTIONS

Here's a tip I've received from a contributor and which myself have forgot to
include.
You can pretty much kill any boss enemy in the game by using a Mix of 2x Wings
to Discovery (Bribe Malboro or Great Malboro, beat up Shinryu or win Remiem
temple race with 3 open chests to get some Wings) and then use the Fury skill
by Lulu. You can reach similar results with Wakka's Attack Reels, Tidus' Slice
& Dice and Blitz Ace.
Another contributor: Alternatively cast Haste on Rikku beforehand and then have
her Use element gems, which will deal 9999 damage five times - this method is
faster than waiting for Lulu's, or anyone's overdrive for that matter (sent by
cerial killer).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

IX - AL BHED RANKS ---> A850

As you progress thru the game, you can obtain up to 26 Al Bhed Primers, whose
purpose is to 'teach' you how to talk Al Bhed-ish. After certain amount of
Primers is found, you're awarded a rank. But ranks have weird names...

- 1 Primer found - Hujela - Novice
- 4 Primers found - Pakehhan - Beginner
- 7 Primers found - Typpman - Dabbler
- 10 Primers found - Maynhan - Learner
- 13 Primers found - Cbaygan - Speaker
- 16 Primers found - Hydeja - Native
- 19 Primers found - Unydun - Orator
- 22 Primers found - Medanyde - Literati
- 26 Primers found - Sycdan - Master

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

X - ONE-TIME ONLY PRIMERS OBTAINED AGAIN? ---> A851

Thanks to many sources it has been confirmed that you can obtain few of
Primers, which are otherwise one time only chances, in Sanubia Desert. They're
scattered all over it and in this part of the guide you'll find out where. So
far two contributors were generous enough to send in the info for four Primers.
More specific locations (also supported with pics) will be added in later
updates once I get around to 'miss' them and find them again.

Primer I - Found in northeastern area of the Oasis.
Primer III - In the place where you found Wakka.
Primer V - In the place where you found Kimahri. However, this Primer can still
be obtained if you visit S.S. Winno's Bridge. Look in the lower right corner of
the screen to obtain this Primer.
Primer XIV - Found in Sanubia Desert - East near the chest with 4x Hi-Potion
inside.

Primers XIX, XX, XXI and XXII need to be relocated still. During my recent game
I wasn't able to obtain them nowhere ever again. Until someone proves me wrong,
I stand to believe that these four Primers are one-time-deal only and if
they're missed, cannot be recovered in the same game. The only way to obtain
them is thru compilation sphere.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

XI - QUICKLY ATTAIN ATTACK REELS, STATUS REELS, AUROCHS REELS, JUPITER SIGIL

Be warned. Quickly doesn't mean in five minutes or so, but in 30 blitz games or
so. Let's assume you haven't played any blitz games yet, meaning that your team
(or what's left of it) is still pretty basic.
I'm talking from personal experience here. I'll put down who I used for the
most of the matches and what did I do for the time to pass quicker. Also
important is the fact that you'll never ever have to use Reset Team Data
feature!

First you'll obtain Attack Reels, which appear as Tournament prize. Second are
Status Reels as League prize. Third are Aurochs Reels as Tournament prize. And
finally Jupiter Sigil as League prize.

I started to bother getting Jupiter Sigil and all of Wakka's Reels cos I was
annoyed to see Wakka being the only one not powered up. With one testing day I
got them all. Now I'm about to share my experience with you. You're welcome to
try it yourself if you wish.

For starters I waited until I had the airship permanently. I also didn't play
any games except the story-important one. First I wanted to improve my team. I
replaced all of the original members sans Tidus.

ATTACKER: Tidus is an excellent attacker, so let him be. For the other attacker
I chose Linna (found outside Macalania temple). PAL players might have problems
cos of Dark Shiva, in which case Wedge (17 SH!) will also be a good choice. I
really recommend Linna though, since she starts with Nap Shot 3, a shoot tech
which puts goalie to sleep with 100% probability, unless goalie can resist nap.

MIDFIELDER: I recruited Brother on the airship. IMO he developed in an
excellent all-around player. His speed also proved invaluable in most of the
games.

DEFENDER: I needed two players. I chose Ropp (Mi'ihen Travel agency) and
Balgerda (she's originally a member of Luca Goers, but her contract ran out and
she didn't resign, so I recruited her). If you can't get Balgerda, then I
recommend Kyou, one of the two guards on the bridge leading to Djose temple.

GOALIE: I got lucky once again and was able to recruit Nimrook (Al Bhed
Psyches), but Jumal will also be an excellent addendum. He can be found on Luca
Square, sitting on the bench.

You're not over yet... if you don't have Jecht Shot yet, return to S.S. Winno
and learn it by examining the blitzball there. Now you're done.

After I collected my blitz team, I closed in on nearest save point and chose
'Play Blitzball'... League was open, but Tournament was closed for now.
You need to play 10 league games before season is over. For tournament you need
to play either two (if you were seeded) or three games before season is over.
League game can be tied, but tournament can't. If game is tied at the end of
2nd halftime, overtime issues. Team that scores first wins the game.
Exhibition game can be forfeited at any time (you do need to have the ball in
your possession), but league and tournament only when you're losing and you
have possession of the ball.

I had to use few tricks in order to obtain all Reels and sigil in shortest
amount of games possible. I started by playing League season first. I *did not*
intend to finish first yet, cos the award was a crappy one.
Once league game issued, I let the opposing team score, then as soon as I got
the ball from Blitzoff, pressed Triangle and forfeited the game. After the
results were shown, EXP distributed etc. I was presented with two choices:
'Back' or 'Continue playing blitzball'.
I chose 'Back', since Tournament may have opened. I wasn't sure and didn't want
to risk having a crappy reward appear as first prize. Once I appeared at save
point, I saved the game. Then I chose to play blitzball again. Tournament
wasn't open yet, so I played round 2 in league. I let the opposing team score,
then forfeited the game, chose 'Back', saved, chose 'Play blitzball'.
Tournament was now open, but the prize for first place was Underdog's Secret.
Ugh. Soft reset and loading of lastly saved game. I checked again. Tournament
was open and the prize for first place were Attack Reels. Now we're talking.

Engage in tournament battles! If you're seeded, you will need to win two games,
otherwise three. Personally I was seeded. Set Tidus and Linna (or Wedge) as
attackers, Brother as midfielder, Ropp and Balgerda (Kyou) as defenders,
Nimrook (Jumal) as goalie. If Blitzoff's ball landed in Brother's possession,
good. Otherwise I'd wrestle the ball from opposing player's ASAP and pass it to
Brother. Why him? With 75 speed he's undeniably the fastest current blitzer.
This means I used him to swim near opposing players, who (in attempt to try to
get the ball) started chasing him, but since he was way faster I was able to
keep the distance with ease. I did so for all five opposing players and lured
them to my half of the field. After I felt it was safe enough, I made a pass to
Tidus. Cos all of the opposition was after Brother, I had free way to the goal.
Once I got as close as I could, I used Sphere Shot to add few extra points to
SH. Goal! If one or two enemy defenders still manage to catch up with you or
get in your way, use Jecht Shot to knock them away.
Blitzoff will cause the ball to land in opposition's possession. Now I needed
to keep enemy players away from my goal. After I wrestled the ball from the
again, I passed it to Brother, who again served as bate and lured all enemy
players behind him on the opposing half of the field. This time I passed the
ball to either Ropp or Balgerda (Kyou). Whoever received the ball, I steered it
behind Nimrook (Jumal). Opposing AI is so bad, that it won't come after you if
you're in that position. Uhh, this is getting annoying...:) From now on, every
time I write Balgerda and you don't have her, it means you should read Kyou.
Similar for Nimrook. If you don't have him, then read Jumal.
Now I used this chance to gain some free EXP by passing the ball back and forth
between Ropp and Balgerda until the end of first halftime.
In second halftime as soon as I got the ball, I repeated the exercise with
Brother luring the enemy players away, passing the ball to Ropp and then
gaining free EXP by passes between him and Balgerda. But to not let Tidus and
Linna stay without EXP, I switched Balgerda with Tidus and Ropp with Linna.
Second halftime was over, I was victorious and also gained heaps of EXP, whilst
enemy players were sulking with 0 EXP.:)

I repeated the same strategy for championship match and won without any
difficulties. Attack Reels were mine! 'Back' and saved the game. Next target is
Status Reels, which are league prize. I still had 8 more to go for current
season to finish. Damn. Beware now... most suggest to use Reset Team Data until
Status Reels appear as league prize. *I advise against it!!!* If you do that,
you'll lose all EXP, techs and players you've acquired so far. Although you may
consider that to be a quicker choice, I suggest playing current league up until
round 9 is finished. You either let the opposing team score and then forfeit
the game, or use my strategy I provided above for easy victory and then using
the rest of the match for passes between your defenders for easy EXP. Before
playing 10th league game of current season I saved my game. Engage in 10th game
and do whatever. As it ends, make deadly sure you choose 'Back'. Save your game
in DIFFERENT slot.

Now is the time where game decided what next prize will be. I examined the save
sphere and chose 'Play Blitzball'. Next league prize wasn't Status Reels, so I
reset and reloaded. I kept trying until Status Reels were the prize for first
place. This time I couldn't afford forfeiting too many matches. I needed to win
6 and tie 2 games, so that in the end I had enough points to be first place
finisher. With the help of my game strategy that wasn't a problem at all and
Status Reels were mine.

After I cleared another 10 league games, it was time to start aiming fot
Aurochs Reels, which appear as tournament prize. There was a tournament open at
the time I finished second league season, so I started to play third league
season. After third game of third league season current tournament got closed.
In case you don't know yet, tournament opens/closes every 5 times you open the
blitz menu, whether you play any games or not (unless of course you're already
in a tournament). This is why I saved my game right after I completed fourth
game of third league season. I wasn't sure if another tournament would be open
with Aurochs Reels as award. Well, it wasn't. But after sixth game of third
league season... Of course I saved after the game. After selecting 'Play
Blitzball' new tournament was open with a crappy reward. Six tries later (ie
reset and reload) Aurochs Reels were the prize for first place. I entered the
tournament and with help of my still foolproof strategy walked away with
Aurochs Reels. Now only Jupiter Sigil remained.

I engaged in remaining four games of third league season. Do not forget to save
after 10th game by selecting 'Back'. DO NOT choose 'Continue playing
blitzball'!!! Once you select 'Play Blitzball' at the save sphere, check if
Jupiter Sigil has appeared as league prize. If it hasn't, reset, reload and
check again for so long until it shows up as prize for first place.
Right now blitzball was growing way over my head, so I had to grit my teeth to
get thru another ten games before I claimed Jupiter Sigil as my final reward.
If I never see another blitzball, it'll be too soon. Besides borrowing this
Duke quote both you and I know this is impossible, otherwise this guide would
cease existing.

XII - WANTZ'S APPEARANCE IN MACALANIA WOODS

Wantz, O'aka's brother, is a guy who appears in Macalania Woods late in the
game, more specifically after Highbridge event. He sells empty four-slot
equipment. Recently more and more people have troubles locating this guy,
therefore I created this section in which I shall put my notes about how can
Wantz appear and if possible, what triggers his appearance.
In my most recent play thru the game I ignored O'aka on the whole line, except
for one time when the game forces Tidus to talk to O'aka (on the boat from
Kilika to Luca). I also skipped talking to Wantz on Gagazet when I ran past
him. If you do that, Wantz WILL NOT appear in Macalania Woods. You also aren't
able to find O'aka anymore, which is otherwise to be found in front of Luca's
Theatre.

things in one form or another may be consistent in all versions, some may not
be, and may differ from the U.S. version.**
**All tests on SOS Overdrive were done with critical HP**

Introduction
-------------
It all started from a question that was posted simultaneously on the GameFAQs,
and PlayOnline messageboards. The question was:

"Can I add Double and Triple on the same weapon?? What would happen? Will I
get 6x or 5x AP?"

Content
-------
First of all let's get some fundamentals down, because some people may have
problems in the first step. I will list the abilities in order of strength with
the weakest on the left, and the strongest on the right.

Double AP -> Triple AP
SOS Overdrive -> Double Overdrive -> Triple Overdrive

If you want to make a weapon with a combination of the above abilities that are
on the same line, two scenarios happen. If you make a weapon with an ability
and want to add another ability to it, you CANNOT go left on the table. It will
say Superior ability present. So if you have a weapon that already has Triple
Overdrive on it, then you can't add Double overdrive or SOS Overdrive.
However, if you have a weapon with Double overdrive on it, you can add Triple
overdrive to that weapon with no problem, but cannot add SOS-Overdrive. The
effects of combining these different abilities are discussed further down.

Second I conducted some tests. The tests were done on a Dingo in the Monster
Arena. Wakka was the character that would perform the attack. His overdrive
mode was set to Warrior. The damage done by him was 9,999. And obviously he
would Overkill the Dingo.

AP for Killing Dingo = 2 ap
AP for Overkilling Dingo=  4 ap
AP you get for Overdrive charge:  220 ap
Overdrive to ap: 220 + 4= 224 ap
Overdrive to ap + Double OD: 220 x2 + 4 = 444 ap
Overdrive to ap + Triple OD: 220 x 3 = 664 ap
Overdrive to ap + Double OD + Triple OD: 220x3 + 4 = 664 ap
Overdrive to ap + Double OD + Triple OD + Double AP: (220x3 + 4) x 2= 1328 ap
Overdrive to ap + Double AP: (220 + 4) x 2= 448 ap
Overdrive to ap + Triple AP: (220 + 4) x 3= 672 ap
Overdrive to ap + Double AP + Triple AP: 672 ap
Overdrive to ap + Triple OD + Triple AP: (220x3 + 4) x 3=  1992 AP
Overdrive to ap + SOS Overdrive: 220 x 2 + 4 = 444 ap
Overdrive to ap + SOS Overdrive + Double OD = 220 x 2 + 4 = 444 ap
Overdrive to ap (Toss Hot Spurs): 224 ap (Strange, huh? NO CHANGE with Hot
Spurs!! LOL)
Overdrive to ap + SOS Overdrive (Toss Hot Spurs): 664 ap (Works fine here!)
Overdrive to ap + Double OD (Toss Hot Spurs): 664 ap  (Works fine here!)
Overdrive to ap + Triple OD (Toss Hot Spurs): 884 ap  ((Strange, huh? WRONG
RESULT with Hot Spurs!! LOL)
Overdrive to ap (Toss Eccentrick): 444 ap
Overdrive to ap + Double OD (Toss Eccentrick): 884 ap
Overdrive to ap + Triple OD (Toss Eccentrick): 1324 ap
Overdrive to ap + Triple OD + Triple AP (Toss Hot Spurs): 2652 ap
Overdrive to ap + Triple OD + Triple AP (Toss Eccentrick): 3972 ap
Overdrive to ap + Triple OD + Triple AP (Toss Hot spurs AND Eccentric): 5292

We learn a couple of things from all this:

1- We learn that Eccentric will always Double the overdrive amount, however HOT
SPURS DOES NOT WORK THE WAY IT IS SUPPOSED TO!!! When you cast Hot Spurs on
someone, it says 1.5 x Overdrive. From examining the results we see that Hot
Spurs does the following:

No Overdrive enhancing weapons present: Hot Spurs does = 1 x Overdrive
With Double OD or (SOS Overdrive on weapon and Critical HP): Hot Spurs does =
1.5 x Overdrive
With Triple OD on weapon: Hot Spurs does = 4/3 x Overdrive

I thought the above was interesting, since it was obviously a GLITCH WITH HOT
SPURS, since the game itself SAYS 1.5 x Overdrive, when you cast it.  :)

2- Superior ability trait takes over:

Double AP + Triple AP = Triple AP
SOS Overdrive + Double Overdrive = Double Overdrive
SOS Overdrive + Triple Overdrive = Triple Overdrive
Double Overdrive + Triple Overdrive = Triple Overdrive
SOS Overdrive + Double Overdrive + Triple Overdrive = Triple Overdrive

3- Best AP combo involves Triple AP + Triple Overdrive, and having tossed Hot
Spurs and Eccentrick beforehand, which results in:

(24 x Overdrive amount) + (3 x m x Fiend AP)
This is not really recommended unless you are super hungry for AP, because you
will have to use items.

4- Most efficient AP combo is using a weapon with Triple Overdrive + Triple AP,
and no Hot Spurs and Eccentric.

To summarize everything, I will end this with a nice nifty formula:

n=1 for Standard, n=2 for Double overdrive or (SOS Overdrive + Critical HP),
n=3 for Triple overdrive
m=1 for Standard, m=2 for Overkill
h=1 standard, h=2 for Double AP, h=3 for Triple AP
k=1 Standard, k=2  for Eccentrick
j=1 if (no Hot Spurs tossed), OR (Hot Spurs tossed but no Double overdrive OR
Triple overdrive on weapon)
j= 4/3 if Hot Spurs tossed, AND Triple overdrive on weapon
j= 1.5 if Hot Spurs tossed, AND Double overdrive on weapon OR (SOS Overdrive on
weapon and Critical HP)

Total AP= ((j x k x n x Overdrive amount) + m x Fiend AP) x h

XIV - ULTIMATE ARMOR GUIDE

Permission granted by Masamune3!

Part 1: Introduction

Much of this information is taken from my message board topic on the Final
Fantasy X board, so kudos to all those who were a part of it. Special thanks
should be given to good 'ol CB!.

Part 2: What is an ultimate armor?

An ultimate armor is the all-around best armor for every situation. Obviously,
you can't expect one armor to get you through the entire game, so for certain
battles (especially Dark Aeons and Penance) specialised armors need to be made.

Part 3: Where do I start?

First you need to get yourself empty 4-slotted armor's for each character. You
can buy them from Wantz at Macalania Woods for 100000 each. If you like, you
can try your luck Inside Sin and at the Omega Ruins to try to win them from
various fiends. But your best bet is just to buy them.

Part 4: Okay, so what do I put on them?

Now, for the business end of your armors. It can take you 5 minutes to 5 hours
to make them. It depends on two things. The amount of gil you have, and your
characters stats. To make things easier, you should at least be able to dispose
of Fafnir in the Monster Arena.

Now, what to put on them? The following is a list of abilities and their
effect, and lastly, my opinions of them.

Ability: Break HP Limit
Effect: Allows you to have more than 9999 HP, up to a max of 99999 HP.
Opinion: This ability is too highly overrated. With max Defence, there is
simply no need for your HP to exceed 9999. Not to mention the time it takes to
obtain enough Wings to Discovery to put it on everyone's armor. A waste of a
slot.

Ability: Break MP Limit
Effect: Allows you to have more than 999 MP, up to a max of 9,999 MP.
Requires: Three Stars x30
Opinion: As useless as Break HP Limit. Especially considering your 2 main spell
casters have One MP Cost on their Celestial Weapons. Use a Three Stars to
reduce MP cost to 0 if you must, other than that, don't bother.

Ability: Ribbon
Effect: Protects against every single status ailment, except for Curse, Death,
and the 4 breaks, all of the time.
Opinion: A top ability, however it is not always needed. My personal preference
is to have it on only one person's armor. Me, Tidus, cause he is the main
character. Not necessary in every battle, because not every enemy uses status
attacks.

Ability: Auto-Haste
Effect: Automatically puts the character in Haste status.
Opinion: One of the best auto-abilities in the game. A must have.

Ability: Auto-Protect
Effect: Automatically puts the character in Protect status.
Opinion: Another great ability, up there with Auto-Haste. Cuts down physicals
by half. Also a must.

Ability: Auto-Phoenix
Effect: Automatically uses a phoenix down when a party member dies.
Opinion: Useful against enemies who only attack one character at a time. Makes
you pretty much invincible. A must.

Ability: Auto-Regen
Effect: Automatically puts the character in Regen status.
Opinion: Worth considering, but it really works (only restores somewhere around
100 - 450 HP per turn) to be effective. Be careful if you are Zombied if you
decide to use it. Better than most, it should be given consideration.

Ability: Defence +20%
Effect: Increases defence power by 20%.
Opinion: Many people have argued to me about using this armor ability, so I
will put it bluntly, you cannot beat Penance without this ability (unless of
course you use Zanmato, exceed 9999 HP, or use Sentinel to protect against
Immolation, none of which are recommended). Couple this with Auto-Protect and
you will reduce damage taken from physical attacks by 60%.

Ability: Auto Shell
Effect: Automatically puts the character in Shell status.
Opinion: Not as useful as you may think, as it not only cuts magical attacks by
half, but also healing magic. Not to mention it is a time-consuming process to
give it to more than 1 character.

Ability: Auto Reflect
Effect: Automatically puts the character in Reflect status.
Opinion: Not great, because you will have to cast reflect on an enemy in order
to use healing magic on the Auto-Reflected character. It wastes turns and is
really not worth the effort.

Ability: Auto Potion
Effect: Automatically uses a potion when attacked.
Opinion: A handy ability, but not one I would use too frequently, good against
Penance and Nemesis, and is much better than Auto-Regen, but only if you can be
bothered to stack up on Potions. Extraordinary when coupled with a Trio of
9999, (if your max HP is only 9999) will give you a full healing without even
wasting a turn. Keep in mind a Potion is only used when your HP falls below
50%.

Ability: Auto Med
Effect: Automatically uses a status-restorative item when attacked.
Opinion: Complete rubbish. Doesn't cure the status' that need curing. And can
be deactivated in too many ways. Don't waste your time, or your Remedies.

Ability: Master Thief
Effect: Receive only rare items when stealing, despite however many common
items the enemy may be carrying.
Opinion: Potentially an excellent ability. It comes down to opinion on whether
you want this or not. If you Steal/Mug a lot, then get it for at least one
character.

Ability: Pickpocket
Effect: Steal or mug rare items more often.
Opinion: Don't bother when you can have Master Thief, which assures a rare item
steal 100% of the time.

Ability: No Encounters
Effect: Eliminates random monster encounters.
Opinion: NEVER PUT THIS ON SOMEONE'S ULTIMATE ARMOR! That character does not
have to be in your active party for it to take effect. Put this on a separate
armor (or weapon, if you got one from the fiend outside Baaj Temple), and equip
it when you need to. You really should have at least one person with this
ability on a separate armor/weapon.

Ability: Sleepproof
Effect: Always protects against sleep.

Ability: Poisonproof
Effect: Always protects against poisoning.

Ability: Stoneproof
Effect: Always protects against petrification.

Ability: Deathproof

Ability: Confuseproof
Effect: Always protects against confusion.

Ability: Berserkproof
Effect: Always protects against berserk.

Ability: Curseproof
Effect: Always protects against curse.

Opinion: I personally would not bother putting any of these abilities on *my*
ultimate armor. The only one I may consider would be Confuseproof.

Ability: SOS Shell
Effect: Automatically puts the character in Shell status when in critical
condition.

Ability: SOS Protect
Effect: Automatically puts the character in Protect status when in critical
condition.

better.

Opinion: What can I say? All complete crap. Never put any of these on an
ultimate armor.

Part 5: What about you Masamune3? What do you have on *your* ultimate armor?

I opt for:

-Auto-Phoenix
-Auto-Haste
-Auto-Protect
-Ribbon (Tidus)/Master Thief (Rikku)/Auto-Regen (Rest)

This concludes ultimate armor tutorial.

Battle Mechanics Topic #1: The CTB System
-----------------------------------------

The CTB system works on a system of clock ticks, very similar to FFT. There
are, of course, differences....
Each monster and party member have a counter. Every tick, this counter reduces
by 1. At that point, anyone whose counter has dropped to 0 may take their next
turn. It is not currently known exactly how the game resolves multiple
characters reaching 0 at the same time.
In addition to the counter, every battle object has a tick speed. This is an
integer worked out from the character's Agility. Any action you take will be a
multiple of this tick speed.
When a turn is taken, it sets the counter to a value related to your tick speed
and the ability used. Each ability has a Rank that designates exactly how fast
the ability is. Lower ranked abilities take less time than higher ranked
abilities, and the progression is linear: a Rank 8 ability will take eight
times as long to recover from as opposed to a Rank 1 ability.
The CTB window shows the next 16 turns that will be taken, in whatever order.
It assumes that each character, when their next turn comes up, will select a
Rank 3 move. Rank 3 is the default speed for any ability. Furthermore, the bar
next to each character's 'turn' represents how many ticks away it is. With no
bar showing, the turn is to be taken during the current tick. A full bright
pink bar represents a turn 20 ticks away, and for each further color that is
filled, another 20 ticks is added on. A full bar of the darkest color
represents a turn that is 60 or more ticks away.
Because of all this, there are very few formulas required to explain all this.
We'll cover the most important one now: what the counter is set to when you
take a turn.

The exact value is:
Counter = [Tick Speed*Rank*Haste Status]

...where Rank refers to the Rank of the ability used, and Haste Status is
either 1/2 for Haste, 1 for Normal and 2 for Slow. Keep in mind that when under
Haste status, your Counter will be rounded up if a fraction remains. This often
results in abilities with odd-numbered Ranks used by characters with odd-
numbered tick speeds being recovered from slightly faster than usual.
Casting Haste and Slow also changes the current Counter. A successful casting
of Haste on a character will halve their current Counter while rounding down,
regardless of whether they were Slowed or not beforehand. The opposite happens
with Slow; their Counter will be doubled regardless of whether they were in
Haste or not. Also note that Dispelling either Haste or Slow will *NOT* change
their Counter. Their Counter will continue to descend at the same high or low
value until their next turn.

Your tick speed is worked out via what appears to be a table. Your Agi is
compared to the table, and depending on your Agi, you are allocated the
appropriate tick speed:

Agi        = Tick Speed | Agi        = Tick Speed | Agi        = Tick Speed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
170 -  255   = 3        | 19  -  22    = 10       | 4            = 20
98  -  169   = 4        | 17  -  18    = 11       | 3            = 22
62  -  97    = 5        | 15  -  16    = 12       | 2            = 24
44  -  61    = 6        | 12  -  14    = 13       | 1            = 26
35  -  43    = 7        | 10  -  11    = 14       | 0            = 28
29  -  34    = 8        | 7   -  9     = 15       |
23  -  28    = 9        | 5   -  6     = 16       |

(Note: As of this time, Agi 12 had to be worked out from Buers, 4 from Funguars
and 0 from Magic Pots. The final three Agi scores (1 - 3) are extrapolated from
points 4 and 0, and may not be correct.)
From this, we can see that you will get your lowest (and best) tick speed of 3
at 170 Agi onwards. Higher Agi than that isn't necessarily wasted, but it won't
make your turns come any faster.

SPECIFICS ABOUT REGEN

Regen is very heavily tied into the clock tick system, more than most. Unlike
Poison, which acts independently every time the poisoned victim takes a turn,
Regen activates whenever *ANYONE* takes a turn. However, it takes its strength
from the tick counter.
Regen activates just before the next turn is taken, and it heals proportionally
according to the number of clock ticks that have passed between the turns. The
exact amount of HP healed is:
[Clock Ticks Passed * Max HP / 256] + 100

So, if you had 9999 Max HP and 21 clock ticks pass between your turn and the
next character in line (an enemy, an ally or even yourself), you would be
healed for 920 HP just before the start of that turn.
Obviously, the more HP you have, the more you heal. Also of note is the more
turns that are taken, the more you'll heal over the same amount of clock ticks,
since you get an extra 100 for each turn that is taken.

THE ABILITIES

As stated, your average ability is considered to be Rank 3. Here is a listing
of every ability the player can use in normal combat and their associated rank.
A few notes before we begin. The Overdrive categories sometimes have their own
rank that differs from the individual abilities inside. The ranks of the
categories are included for completeness, and appear to have no bearing on the
actual time taken to recover from an Overdrive.
Also, Summoning pauses the counter for all three party members, and sets Yuna's
next counter to Rank 3. When the summon is killed or dismissed, their counters
resume as normal from the moment the Aeon vanished.

Battle Mechanics Topic #2: Equipment Prices
-------------------------------------------

The prices allocated to the different weapons and armors you find in the game
is very straightforward. The base price for the item is controlled by three
factors: (1) the number of slots in the item, (2) the number of blank slots in
the item, and (3) the abilities on the item.

The latter of these is the most important, so we shall cover that first. Each
ability that can be found a weapon or armor has a base cost to it. The base
costs of every ability will be listed after the mechanics have be explained.

The base cost of the weapon itself is equal to the sum of the individual
ability base costs plus 5 and then multiplied by 5. In formulaic terms, it is
expressed like so:
Weapon Base = (Sum of Ability Base + 5) * 5

The number of slots on the weapon and the number of blank slots on the weapon
each add a multiplier to this. This is done by the following two tables:

0 Slots: SltM = 2
1 Slot: SltM = 2
2 Slots: SltM = 3
3 Slots: SltM = 6
4 Slots: SltM = 10

0 Blanks: BlnkM = 1
1 Blank: BlnkM = 1
2 Blanks: BlnkM = 3/2
3 Blanks: BlnkM = 3
4 Blanks: BlnkM = 400

The final cost of the weapon is equal to:
[Weapon Base * SltM * BlnkM]

The selling cost of a weapon is equal to 25% of the final cost. In addition,
various merchants throughout the game will apply their own discounts and
surcharges to the buying cost of weapons and items.

As an example and a fun exercise, we will look at the Caladbolg, and work out
how much it would sell for if you could actually sell it.

Caladbolg has the abilities Break Damage Limit, Triple Overdrive, Evade &
Counter and Magic Counter. These have the base costs of 0, 4000, 2200 and 2500
respectively.

This gives us a base cost for the weapon of:
(0 + 4000 + 2200 + 2500 + 5) * 5 = 43525

Now, the weapon has 4 Slots in total for a Slot Multiplier of 10, and no blank
slots, giving a Blank Multiplier of 1. So the end result is:
[43525 * 10 * 1] = 435250

Finally, since we want the selling price, we divide this by 4 to get:
[435250 / 4] = 108812

Now, for the abilities and how much they're worth.

----------------------------------------
Battle Mechanics Topic #3: The AP System
----------------------------------------

There is a stat that we will call Total Sphere Level or TSLv for short.

It starts at different levels for various characters:
Tidus: 0
Wakka: 2
Yuna: 2
Lulu: 2
Kimahri: 6
Auron: 12
Rikku: 25

Every time you gain a Sphere Level, your TSLv increases by 1, to a practical
maximum of 101.

The amount of AP you require to reach your next Sphere Level is dictated by
your Total Sphere Level. The formula for TSLvs 0-100 is:
AP Req = 5*(TSL + 1) + [(TSL^3) / 50]

If your TSLv is 101 (or more, but there's no proof that it ever increases past
that), your AP Requirement will instead be 22000.

AP GAINING
During battle, each character has an AP pool. This pool begins at 0 when battle
starts. Whenever an action occurs that merits an experience increase, it will
immediately increment the pool.
Everyone in the party earns AP from a defeated monster *immediately* which is
applied to the pool. Double and Triple AP is applied here, not at the end of
battle. To be able to use Double or Triple AP, however, the character must be
in the current party and be active: a KOed character, for example, will not be
able to receive Triple AP from a monster kill, even if he is raised before the
battle is ended.
Overdrive -> AP is also handled via the pool, and Triple AP is applied to it at
the exact same time. Switching weapons to bring in a Triple AP *after* you have
accumulated Overdrive -> AP points does not work.
Once the battle has officially ended, either by killing all monsters in the
field or successfully escaping, any character who completed a turn in battle
and is still active is eligible to transfer all AP in their pool to themselves.
Any character that never took a turn will gain no AP, even if their pool is not
empty. Switching out to another character does not count as taking a turn.
As stated, Double and Triple AP are applied as AP is added to the pool; they do
not magically multiply the final result by 2 or 3. You must have the character
in the active party and with the weapon equipped at all points where you earn
the AP in order to benefit.

OVERDRIVE -> AP
Other than killing and overkilling fiends, Overdrive -> AP is the only other
way to accumulate AP in battle.
Your Overdrive meter is measured in percentage points, from 0 to 100. Fractions
of a percentage point cannot be gained.
Overdrive -> AP activates whenever you have a weapon equipped with it on it and
your Overdrive charges. It converts Overdrive to AP based on your current AP
requirement.

The basic formula for this is:
AP Earned = [Overdrive% * AP Requirement / 100]

For example, if your Overdrive is charged by 3% and your current Total Sphere
Level is 97 - giving you an AP Requirement of 18743 - then Overdrive -> AP
would convert that to:
[3 * 18743 / 100] = [562.29] = 562

However, Overdrive -> AP also has a penalty associated with it. In order to
prevent you from continually charging your Overdrive to rake in the AP, each
time your Overdrive is converted past the first time, a cumulative penalty will
be applied to it. This occurs no matter what Overdrive Mode you are in. The
only way to avoid it is to only have your Overdrive charge once per battle.

The penalty is applied separately to each character; if two characters have
weapons that have Overdrive -> AP on it, any one of them will only get
penalised if their *own* Overdrive charges more than once. Only the number of
times the individual character has charged *and* converted is looked at when
working out the penalty.

Charging your Overdrive on a weapon that does not have Overdrive -> AP is not
counted towards the penalty.

The penalty itself is a compounding 90% each time multiplied to the conversion
rate. The exact formulas for each charge can be defined as follows:
1st Charge: AP = [Overdrive% * AP Requirement / 100]
2nd Charge: AP = [([Overdrive% * AP Requirement / 100] - 1) * 0.9]
3rd+ Charge: AP = [(Overdrive% * AP Requirement / 100) * (0.9^(Charge - 1))]

Thus, the best way to get the most out of Overdrive -> AP is to choose
Overdrive modes that can give you a large charge all in one go, not split up
over several turns. In addition, there is no point in charging your Overdrive
more than about 10 times; by that point, you've already collected 65% of the
maximum amount of AP you could get out of this due to the compounding penalty.
22 charges are required to get 90% of the total amount out, by which point each
charge will be giving you only 10% of what your first charge gave you.

XVII) ABOUT FFX BONUS DVD ---> A841
=============================================================================
=============================================================================

PAL players of FFX have received additional DVD with few extra goodies on it.
This section is dedicated to revealing the info contained on that DVD. I know
that NTSC players would be especially interested in it.
Once you pop in bonus DVD, a choice will prompt you to choose from one of five
languages. Next screen will appear, titled 'Beyond Final Fantasy'. Below it
there are five entries:

TRAILERS, PREVIEWS, INTERVIEWS, GALLERY, FINAL FANTASY X THEME SONG
Let's examine each of five entries more closely...

************
I - TRAILERS
************
Picking this option will present you with another submenu with five options,
each of them outlined below, along with info on what they contain.

Ia - Final Fantasy History
As you pick this, a Hironobu Sakaguchi quote will appear: 'I don't think I have
what it takes to make a good action game. I prefer telling stories.'
Then you get to see a few scenew from FFV, FFVI, FFVII, FFVIII and FFIX. After
that a bunch of scenes is shown from FFX, ending it with Copyright notice for
Squaresoft.

Ib - Final Fantasy X Trailer 1
This trailer shows a lot of scenes from first quarter of the game. I can't tell
what is shown in this trailer as it could spoil the game.

Ic - Final Fantasy X Trailer 2
Much like the previous trailer, most of the scenes are from first quarter of
the game. And much like before, I can't really tell you what the scenes are
about.

Id - Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within (Original Theatrical Trailer)
This is the trailer showing scenes from Squaresoft's movie The Spirits Within.
I don't know whether or not you've seen it, so I'll refrain from talking too
much.

Ie - To Main Menu
This option lets you return to main menu.

*************
II - PREVIEWS
*************
Picking this option will present you with another submenu with three options,
each of them outlined below, along with info on what they contain.

IIa - Kingdom Hearts Tokyo Game Show 2001 Preview
The game I anticipate the most. It's said to arrive in Europe at the end of
November. But as long as I have FFX, I'll keep going. As one of the quotes say:
'No matter how deep the darkness, the light shines within.'

IIb - Kingdom Hearts ES 2002 Preview
Another trailer showing the scenes from next Squaresoft game, made with
combined efforts with Disney studios.

IIc - To Main Menu
This returns you to main menu.

****************
III - INTERVIEWS
****************
Here you can enjoy nine interviews. Two are from people who did voices for
Tidus and Yuna, and seven are from game's creators.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTERVIEW 1 - James Arnold Taylor (voice of Tidus)
The character of Tidus is, he's a young aggressive, excited...young man. He
wants to be right always, he wants to be the hero. When I prepared for that, I
just drew from my own life, especially cos I can relate to the way he reacts to
things, I tend to react and then go, 'This is what I should do in this
situation,' so that's kind of how he takes life and takes...his life in this
game.
Tidus and Yuna, I think when they start off, they're at two completely separate
ends of the world, and they find out throughout the story that they have a lot
more in common than they think. She tends to be very calm and cool and Tidus is
much more aggressive, much more excited, he's ready to go and she's more of a
thinker. But she teaches him so much, it's really a love story between them.
That's what the essential story is, his love for her and him discovering that
love and vice versa.
I think that Tidus is driven by her being so calm and collected. It makes him
more aggressive and he seeks the truth even more and he seeks to pull that
excitement out of her. He wants to see her excited about things and as
energised as he is. And so, I really tried to give some... loving pushes to the
character when they're together to say, 'Come on, let's go! Hey! You know, it's
exciting!' and she said, 'Yeah, OK, I'll get excited but in my time.'
There's like 9000 lines of dialogue, which is really amazing. There is a lot of
dialogue, which is different from any other game that I've ever experienced. On
average, there might be like, for a regular animation, there might be 300 lines
total and 9000 lines... So many different paths to turn in the game and so many
different ways to go, there's so much there.
Well, there's some great memorable moments in this game for me personally.
There's a scene where Yuna teaches Tidus to laugh. Because he's so serious and
he's so set on his mission and he gets so caught up in his emotions. When he's
laughing, it was fun to do and it was fun to watch because we did that to
picture, I got to watch Tidus the character doing this and me adding to it.
That was a lot of fun and very memorable.
There's also some real emotional moments that are very memorable in it where
Tidus finds out some information about Yuna that is shocking to him and he has
to deal with it - he has no choice but to deal with it. And if he wants to be a
hero, he has to take on responsibilities and emotions.
They're new emotions for him but he handles them well and it's a breathtaking
scene, too. The animation in this... when I first say it, we had to stop for a
while where I was going, 'This is amazing animation!' I kept saying it over and
over.
I'd say to the people who play this game and all of the Final Fantasy games,
that this is, in my opinion, the most exciting, the most visually stunning, and
to take the time to go through and get every aspect of the game it could take
hours and hours but it's gonna be a lot of fun and it's a learning experience,
it's a growth. And, you know, not to sound corny, but you'll learn. You can
become possibly a better person because this character, Tidus, he learns and
becomes a better person. If you really get involved in the story, get wrapped
up in it, like most of us do, you should grow from it as well.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTERVIEW 2 - Hedy Burress (voice of Yuna)
Basically, she is a summoner in a mythical land called Spira and is being aided
by some friends on a mission to defeat Sin. This journey that she's on is one
that her father did before her. I get the sense that it's a generational
obligation, as well as an honour, and it gives her this sense of duty, that
motives her through most of the story.
Duty, respect, honour, these are the things that are important to her. These
are the things that I try to translate to the voice of Yuna as well, but at the
same time, retaining the gentleness and femininity that is so apparent in the
way that she looks. So, it was an interesting dichotomy.
I had to come to finding a way to balance those two aspects out. She's this...
gentle yet forceful presence. I wouldn't say docile, because I don't get the
sense she backseats anything.She's very direct, very forthcoming with her
opinions and her ways but she doesn't have to be aggressive about it, abrasive.
She does it in a way that leads others. She brings them to herself and to her
journey and that's evident with the friends that she has...her companions.
More so than lieutenants and sergeants and things, they're her friends. It's a
very familial kind of energy that she exudes. Tidus' character provides her
with a new dimension that we haven't seen to Yuna before, which is the romantic
dimension. It fleshes her out in that extra part of het that we haven't seen.
That's a little more humanising, too, because we've only seen her duty-bound,
her goal to free the land from Sin.
We see her with her friends being a little more human and a little more
personable. But Tidus really provides that... womanly aspect to her, the
romantic element that fleshes her out completely. I think you have to go into
it with an actor head because these mikes and this whole system is so sensitive
that every nuance to your voice will be heard and you can't make your voice
sound like you're thinking, you have to think and your voice will just do it.
It's a lot more organic, I think, than we would initially assume. It's even
something that I've discovered as I do this. So I try to relate myself to the
character that I'm portraying. In this case, I relate myself as best as I can
to Yuna - I haven't save the world lately, so that dimension escapes me a tiny
bit! But, what elements that are there, that are very specific and human and at
the same time, general and identifiable, I try to tap into those elements,
think about it from that perspective and then my voice reflects what I'm
thinking, what I'm feeling without even trying. So, when you force it, it's
obvious.
When you just do it, it's gonna be a lot more enjoyable for you and for the
listener. If I had one thing I'd like the gamers to take away in this movie's
experience, would probable be that - an experience. I want them to get lost in
the story and in these characters, to forget they're playing a game, to
participate like they're there having it happen.
I hope that through our voices, this animation, this story telling, we can
transport them into a completely different world... right there in Spira.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTERVIEW 3 - Yoshinori Kitase (Producer)
For FFVIII and VIII, the setting was sci-fi and many players responded by
saying that they preferred a simple fantasy world.
[Fantasy] They seemed to have a fixed notion of what fantasy means to them, and
to them, it consisted of a medieval European world. I wanted to change that
idea. I wanted to expand the definition of what the players thought the word
'fantasy' implied. Going back to a medieval European fantasy didn't seem to
help us advance, so while I was considering different world environments,
Nojima proposed the idea of trying to create a fantasy world that incorporated
Asian elements.
[Voices] Having voices in the game this time was a major breakthrough and
having live actors play a part in development made the characters even more
lifelike. Before, the characters we created were just figments of our
imagination - something completely unreal. But when a real person with acting
skills contributes their talents to those characters, the dialogue, emotions
and expressions become very lifelike. In this way, I think we were able to
create very realistic characters.
[The Theme] Journey is the main theme that runs throughout the story. In
addition to journey there are many hidden themes so I'm sure that different
players will feel more strongly about certain themes than about others. For me,
the theme of family - more specifically, father and son, father and daughter -
happen to stand out. I'm the father of two children, and so from that
standpoint, I can relate to that theme. But others might relate more to the
relationship between Yuna and Tidus. In this way, I feel that there are many
hidden themes that could surface depending on the player and his or her
experience.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTERVIEW 4 - TETSUYA NOMURA (Character Designer)
The main difference between this game and previous FF titles is how finally
detailed the world setting is.
[The FFX World] I made a conscious effort to not deviate too much and this is
probably what turned out to be the most unique aspect of the game compared to
the other FFs. When the world was first set, there was an overall Asian flavour
to it and there were many elements that were inspired by Thailand and the South
Pacific. These elements reflected the location of the southern islands, and the
Asian flavour was prevalent throughout. Since Japan also exists within Asia, I
wanted to incorporate Japanese touches as well.

INTERVIEW 4 (continued) - FUMI NAKASHIMA (Sub-Character Chief Design)
The aspect I concentrated on most was giving characters from differenet regions
and cultures distinctive styles of clothing. For example, the Al Bhed are
people who function in a machine-oriented society, so I wanted to make them
stand out from other citizens of Spira. I purposely had them wear goggles and
masks in order to make them appear strange and eccentric. The Ronso are a
warrior tribe, so I gave them features that would allow them to engage in
battle easily.
[Favorite Character] If I had to pick one character, it would be Keepa, a
blitzball player for the Besaid Aurochs. He is the only chubby player on the
team, so he stands out. That makes him look cute and that's why I like him.

INTERVIEW 4 (continued) - KOJI SUGIMOTO (Main Programmer - Character)
We gave the designers a little more freedom with facial expression so they were
able to include many bones in the faces. Any by doing this, we were able to
create much more natural expressions. Even the eyes move and blink.
[Playstation 2] It's been said that the PS2 is a very complicated piece of
hardware and that development is complex. That's indeed true, and it's taken a
long time to master it. But the harder you try to push the hardware, the more
rewarding the results. This is where the machine shows its true potential, and
it's fascinating. For example, the detail on Yuna's long sleeves and Tidus'
hood, specular shine and shadows - elements which were different to program
before can now be rendered more realistically, I think.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

INTERVIEW 5 - YOSUKE NAORA (Art Director - World)
At the beginning of the project, when the development staff was deciding on the
concept and world and throwing around ideas, [Asia] I noticed that many people
were interested in Asian-related themes. I was personally interested in Asian
elements, and thought incorporating this into a fantasy world might be
interesting. When I spoke to Nojima, the scenario writer, and Kitase, the
director, they seemed to share the same thoughts, and this seemed like it was
going to work. Like previous FF instalments where the visuals were a big
selling point, this instalment would also have to maintain high visual detail,
but also add new elements. To create these particular game visuals, our staff
checked every single detail to ensure that the visuals didn't look unnatural or
awkward. We also tried to make sure the controls were smooth to minimise
inconvenience and stress.
[Game Visuals] So I hope the player won't find anything unnatural about the
game. We consider a project a success if the player doesn't experience any
awkwardness or stress while playing the game.

INTERVIEW 5 (continued) - TAKAYOSHI NAKAZATO (Director - Map)
The world map appears in many games. I decided to abandon that notion [Reality]
and try to depict map system more realistically. So, we threw out the concept
of the world map in favour of a more realistic representation. In the past, we
had pre-rendered backgrounds, which resemble 3D environments but are in reality
just flat images. So to create the illusion of movement, we had to
painstakingly create each image, frame by frame.
[Modelling] This time, we were able to prepare a 3D model and apply motions to
it, so our breadth of presentation expanded considerably, I think. The map
seems ordinary, but if you stand still and look around, You'll find small
details like grass along the roadside swaying in the wind, or the clouds
moving. I hope you'll take the time to look around and enjoy these small
details. I understand that you'll probably want to finish the game quickly but
try looking around when you have the chance. It'll help us feel that adding all
those little touches was worthwhile.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTERVIEW 6 - TOSHIRO TSUCHIDA (Director - Battle)
It wasn't that I wanted to completely reform the gamem but I wanted to
incorporate elements that as a gamer playing FF I found to be interesting or
entertaining. This resulted in the demise of the ATB system, replaced by a
party interchange system. For example, there's a monster called Bomb that grows
bigger when attacked and in the end, it explodes so the player must try to
defeat it before it explodes. This has been a recurring element in the FF
series, but instead of just progressing through the battles in real time, I
thought it would be more enjoyable for players to take their time [The Thinking
Battle] and analyse how best to defeat the Bomb before is self-destructs.
We've adjusted the battles to offer a sense of satisfaction from taking a
tactical approach. So I believe that those who've tended to fight without too
much thought might now find a new way to enjoy battles by taking the time to
strategise.

INTERVIEW 6 (continued) - SHINTARO TAKAI (Art Director - Battle)
Each time we've created an FF game, there has been a willingness to change some
aspect or the other from its predecessors. For my part, I think I've changed
the way aeons are handled in this instalment. The world setting for this game
is highly developed, and the scenario and art consequently synchronize well.
[Battles And Scenarios] In the same way, the battles are not independent
elements of the game, and it was my intention from the beginning to create
something that mirrored the scenario, too. Coming up with new aeons was easy
and natural for me since I matched the aeons - part of the visual spectacle of
the game - to fit the world. This time, since Yuna's unique ability to summon
aeons was a key point, I knew from the start that I wanted to present scenes
focusing on the connection between Yuna and the aeons. I'm very proud of the
results and although the summoning sequences may seem long, they've been paced
well, so I believe they're enjoyable to watch.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTERVIEW 7 - MOTOMU TORIYAMA (Director - Event)
Until now, I only had to give directorial instructions to the graphics staff,
but this time, we had voiceovers and actors to act out the scenes. We then used
this as a base to create everything else; so in a sense, I finally felt like I
was able to do directorial work, in the real sense of the word.
[Real Direction] Until now, I had done my work from my cubicle, but I had the
chance to visit the studio often this time, where I came into contact with many
more people. For me, finding a way to imbue - as much as possible - the game's
characters with the realistic qualities of the actors was the main goal.

INTERVIEW 7 (continued) - TAKASHI KATANO (Main Programmer - Event)
As memory capacity increased, we tended to use it up. Since the PS2 has
improved graphics, the amount of data used for presentation also increased and
insufficient memory always seemed to be a problem. Planners' requests were very
demanding, so keeping up with that was the most diificult task for me.
Regarding the seamless transition between events and battles, since the
controls are completely different, the transfer between the two was difficult
to overcome. But the results should show the effort we put into it, so I hope
everyone enjoys the game.

INTERVIEW 7 (continued) - KAZUSHIGE NOJIMA (Scenario)
I worked on the scenario for FF VII and VIII, and the relationship between the
main character and the player [Tidus And The Player] is what I've always been
concerned about. I've wanterd to transform that relationship into something
new. In VII, the character was reserved, so I tried to find ways for the player
to imagine what was going through his mind. The hero of VIII was also reticent,
but I tried to get the player to feel more attached to him by having him
disclose his feelings, although the other character couldn't hear his thoughts.
This time, by having the character reflect on the past, we have two facets to
him: a character who moves through the game as well as a character who reflects
on the past. And then we have the player, who is in a completely different
world. I wanted to do something contrary to what I'd been trying to do before,
where I tried to bring the player and the character closer.
'What is Sin?' Whether Sin represents something... If I were to exaggerate, I
would compare it to the obstacles encountered in life, and giving up without
overcoming them when faced with them directly. This of course differs for each
person, but it can be compared to something along those lines. When I explain
Sin to people, they say it's easy to understand when it's compared to a
typhoon. In a deeper sense, I'm sure this analogy also applies.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTERVIEW 8 - CHIHARU MINEKAWA (Supervising Sound Editor)
I shouldn't be one to praise this title's presentation but I think it's just
fantastic. And keeping in line with this, I believe the same degree of quality
is required for sound elements. Since the overall production has grown very
elaborate, our job has become more detailed. We created even the most mundane
sounds meticulously, [Streaming Sounds] so they would flow smoothly all the way
through. The sounds I refer to are souns effects. For example, if you go to a
seaside town and travel from the sea to a mountain path, we've designed the
sounds to change naturally from one location to another. So it's possible that
you won't even notice such subtle changes. For the player to be suddenly
walking through the mountains or other new environments without realising it,
this was out toughest task. It was our goal to provide continuous,
uninterrupted sounds. If everything feels natural to you, we're satisfied that
we've accomplished our task.

INTERVIEW 8 (continued) - NOBUO UEMATSU (Sound Producer & Music)
If I was being demanding, I'd like the players to listen to all of the music. I
have confidence in my music [The Harmony] but I'd also like everyone to hear
the harmony between the sound effects, dialogue and music. That's what I take
the most pride in. The music is toned down and the dialogue is projected when
needed, and sound effects take centre stage where necessary. When music is
meant to be the main element, the dialogue and sound effects take the back
seat. I believe that the three sound effects complement each other well.
[The Theme Song] Regarding the theme song, my first concern was finding someone
to sing it. The Asian-inspired theme had nothing to do with the choice, but
since I was personally interested in Okinawan music, my staff and I looked at
various CDs of that particular region. That's when one staff member found some
CDs by Rikki. I had never heard a voice quite like hers and I contacted her
immediately. After that, I had the chance to visit her hometown of Amami
Ooshima and meet her several times. I had a certain image for the song in mind
but it was difficult to complete. The deadline was fast approaching, so I tried
changing my work environment to finish the song. I took the synthesizer from my
office and brought it into the reception room. After the girls at the front
desk left for the day, I sat there alone through the night, composing my songs.
After this switch, I was able to compose nearly ten songs in an hour. Any of
them could have been used but I took the one I considered best for the theme. I
completed the melody first, so I had Nojima write the lyrics afterwards. We
both celebrated the night it was completed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTERVIEW 9 - HIRONOBU SAKAGUCHI (Executive Producer)
After switching over to the Famicom (NES), there was a time when I wasn't happy
with anything I was creating. I thought of retiring from the game industry and
I created Final Fantasy as my final project. That's why the title includes the
word 'final' but for me, the title 'Final Fantasy' reflectes my emotional state
at the time and the feeling that time had stopped. They say that
technologically, it's good to keep going, and each time we give it our all and
expend our skills and energy until we can go no further; this is what I
consider to be the 'final fantasy'.
The stories and characters change each time. This is because stories tend to
limit a world and I think by changing these aspects and creating new material
for each title, we try to show our full potential. In a way, you can say it
serves us as a type of challenge for us.
[The Production Of FF The Movie] While we were working on the movie, the eighth
instalment was being developed simultaneously. From that time, I've been giving
input on hair simulation, clothes, and so forth. We use a CG tool called MAYA -
3D CG software as well as original tools created in Honolulu, so I give input
on these elements as well. One thing I noticed while working on the film - and
this is something I've thought about while working on games, too - is the
importance of the pre-production scenarios, concept art and world. It's vital
to have several ideas for the concept and to select just one to shape into a
game or movie. I believe it is important for you to take your time during this
process and to remain focused in order to create something impressive.
[The Future] For example, going from Final Fantasy VI to VII, everyone was
uneasy about the transition. In making the jump to 3D, I had to ask myself
whether this was indeed a Final Fantasy world as we progressed. This time,
moving to the PS2, adding in voices and conducting everything in real time
brought its own share of anxiety.
But as I mentioned before, for me, the true definition of Final Fantasy is to
continue challenging myself. So, I'd like to explore new frontiers and move in
a direction yet to be uncovered.

Va - Rikki (profile)
Name: Rikki Nakano
Born in Amami Oshima in 1975. Started to sing traditional folk music at the age
of 4, and at the age of 15 she became the youngest 'Grand Prix' winner in the
history of Japan Traditional Folk Music Awards. She started her career as a
professional singer singer and released her first album 'Mucha ka na' in 1993.
Rikk's talents allow her to combine elements of both traditional folk and pop
music, winning her praise wvene from outside the folk genre.
She has also appeared at international festivals such as the Nagaragawa
International Jazz festival (1994), the Asian Pacific Festival 1996/Asian Now,
the Cannes International Music Festival (1997) and the Japan Art & Culture
festival (1999).
Many musicians are inspired by the voice of Rikki. She was requested to perform
at the opening ceremony of the 1998 Nagano Paraolympics for which Joe Hisaishi
was musical producer, and she appeared in the same year as a spectacular sound
and music event in Daigo temple in Kyoto, again produced by Joe Hisaishi.
The singer Kazufumi Miyazawa of rock band 'The Boom' was inspired by her
singing voice as well and Rikki appeared on one of their albums and on a solo
album by Miyazawa. In 2001, she produced and 'image album' with Joe Hisaishi
for the film 'Spirited Away' (directed by Hayao Miyazaki).
The single 'Suteki da ne', featured in FINAL FANTASY X, was a collaboration
with Nobuo Uematsu and was released in Japan on 18th July in the same year. It
reached No10 on the Oricon, the Japanese singles chart, and continues to sell
well.
The mini album 'Kanaria', containing a version of the single of 'Suteki da ne'
(autumn version), was released in Japan on 3rd Oct 2001.

*The Script*
~~~~~~~~~~~~

So here we be, the script! Read and enjoy, and remember to note that there are
SPOILERS!

^Camera in Underwater, in the viewpoint of someone, looking up towards the sun.
^

*YUNA*: 37, 38, 39, 40, 41

^Yuna bursts to the surface of the water. She can see that sky is cloudless,
and sun glare covers half the screen. She takes deep breaths.^

YUNA: (happily) Two minutes, forty one seconds, a new high!

^A shout is heard from behind Yuna^

WAKKA: Yuna! C'mon!

YUNA: Be right there!

^Wakka crosses his arms and looks out to Yuna. Yuna walks up the beach. It's
Besaid Beach.^

WAKKA: (enthusiastically) Pretty good at holding your breath now, ya?

YUNA: Not as good as you!

WAKKA: (embarrisingly) Yeah, well, I haven't even practiced recently.

YUNA: You sure look it.

^Yuna taps Wakka's stomach several times. A stereotypical "rubber ducky" (ie,
when you squeeze a squeaky thing) sound is heard when she prods it. Wakka slaps
his forehead.^

WAKKA: Eh... ah...

YUNA: (exclaiming) It's not like you're the one having a baby!

^Wakka turns round and runs off towards Besaid. Yuna watches him run off, then
turns and looks out towards sea.^

*YUNA*: It's been two years since then. I can hold my breath underwater for two
whole minutes now. It takes more than just physical strength, there's a few
tricks to it that you need to figure out. I didn't understand when it was
explained in words, but after a lot of practise, I finally got it. I'd never
thought there was any kind of trick to it. I couldn't afford to think about
anything back then.

^Camera Zooms out, overlooking the bay. Yuna turns and walks towards Besaid.^

*YUNA*: The Eternal Calm. It's my two minutes and forty one seconds and Wakka's
pudgy stomach. It's not much, just a quiet kind of happiness.

^FADE OUT^

^A large creaking door is heard^

^FADE into Yuna appears with a Yevon drape in the background. Camera zooms in
behind Yuna; she is at the door the Besaid Temple. She walks in. Wakka and some
man are talking to each other. They notice Yuna, and walk over to her.^

OLD MAN: (awestruck) I saw you from a distance at the stadium two years ago...
but I never thought I'd get to see you in person. You're as beautiful as
ever... ::sigh::

YUNA: Thank you.

OLD MAN: (concerned) I have a favour to ask about my grandson. He's joined up
with the Young Persons' Alliance. Now, not to say the Alliance is bad in and of
itself... but me and the missus are both in New Yevon, my son and daughter-in-
law too. My grandson used to come to our meetings, but one day he just...
There's a lot of young folks in the Alliance, so I'm sure it's exciting for
him, but still...

^Camera begins to circle the statue of High Summoner Braska.^

*YUNA*: A number of groups have formed across Spira since then. How should we
build this new world? What should Spira be like in the future? Everyone is
looking for their own path.

^Camera goes back to watch the conversation.^

OLD MAN: I feel that... my grandson and his companions are moving too quickly.

*YUNA*: With so many different ways of thinking, at times conflict is
inevitable. Some people are uncomfortable with the new way of things. Honestly,
I am too, sometimes... But this is good enough for now. That's what I keep
telling myself.

YUNA: I understand your feelings. But try talking over with your grandson. His
actions may appear reckless to you, but his feelings for Spira are the same as
your own.

OLD MAN: ::sigh::

^Camera zooms out again. Yuna and the Old Man are talking, but cannot be heard.
FADE OUT^

^FADE into at a flyby shot of Rainbow Falls at Besaid. Yuna is walking towards
the camera <away from Besaid>, as it zooms to the bridge. Wakka can be seen
running towards Yuna from behind. Camera zooms to behind Wakka, near normal
game camera position.^

WAKKA: (shouting) He-ey!

YUNA: Who is it? A visitor?

WAKKA: ::sounding tired:: <that run has worn him out!> Ya, you know how it is.
The village geezers are shooting their mouths off about that again.

YUNA: Who is it this time?

WAKKA: The son of the head of New Yevon.

YUNA: No way. I'd probably just end up being used by him.

WAKKA: ::slaps forehead:: Man... sorry, Yuna.

YUNA: I'll go turn them down

WAKKA: No problem, I got it. I mean, you don't wanna hafta see their frowning
faces, do ya?

YUNA: ...Right.

^Camera goes to the path, to see a young man, dressed in what appears to be a
Crusaders uniform, runs towards Yuna and Wakka.^

Young Man: Lady Yuna! ::does a Spira Salute:: Lady Yuna! I am Yeivel of the
Young Persons' Alliance! I have come today to deliver a message from our leader
Nurge!

WAKKA: She's not joining the alliance.

YEIVEL: But...

YUNA: Is that why you came?

YEIVEL: ...yes, it is.

YUNA: I'm not going to join with any group.

^Yeivel runs towards Yuna, but is blocked by Wakka.^

YEIVEL: Are you perhaps going to form your own group?

^Camera goes to Yuna, and begins to circle her face.^

YUNA: Please leave.

^Camera zooms around the bend, and Rikku run round!^

RIKKU: Yuna! Wakka!

^FADE OUT^

^Sea and seagulls can be heard.^

^FADE into Rikku's Salvage ship.^

*YUNA*: Rikku sometimes comes to Besaid Island. She travels about Spira,
teaching people how to use machina, excavating old machina from underground or
underwater... She's awfully busy, but she seems to be enjoying herself.

^You can hear Rikku making strange noises. The camera zooms to Wakka's belly.
Rikku is elbowing it cheekily. It makes that strange Squeezy Toy sound again
every time she presses it.^

WAKKA: Stop that!

RIKKU: Quite the tummy you've got now. So how's Lulu?

WAKKA: She's in the village. Come say 'hi' later.

RIKKU: Of course! ::Turns to Yuna:: And Yunie, same as always, huh?

YUNA: That's right. Same as always.

^Yuna looks to the sky, shielding her eyes from the bright sunlight. The camera
goes to an angled birds-eye view of the ship. Seagulls <?> are seen squawking
past. Camera changes to long side view of the ship.^

WAKKA: So Kimahri's still at Mt. Gagazet?

RIKKU: You betcha! He's teaching the Ronso children tons of stuff. He's really
quite the teacher! ::fumbles in her pouch:: Anyway, I got something from
Kimahri for you. He said he found it up the mountain.

YUNA: A sphere? <Movie btw>

WAKKA: Weird shape, huh?

RIKKU: ::with a hint of concern:: Look closely, Yuna.

^Rikku turns the movie sphere on. The screen fades, and fades back into
something which looks like what you see on a poorly tuned, but nearly there,
TV. Strange rattling sounds can be heard. Suddenly, bars appear, and a rattling
sound... And someone familiar is behind them... Sound quality is poor.^

Tidus: What the hell do I get arrested for? Let me go already! You hear me,
don't you? What'd you think if she was your girl? Who cares if I used the
enemy's machina? It was the only way to save the Summoner! What would you have
done instead?! Let me out of here! Let me see her!

^The movie sphere finishes, and the screen goes white, then back to the ship.^

*YUNA*: A voice... a voice that had been close by for what seemed like
forever...

WAKKA: What's this about? What's he doing there? Is that really him? What's
this all about?

RIKKU: I don't really know... but you want to find out, don't you?

WAKKA: Well, yeah!

YUNA: Yes.

RIKKU: Then let's go!

YUNA: Where to?

RIKKU: No idea! Let's go talk to Kimahri first and think about it then, okay?

WAKKA: But we don't know anything! <Wakka, take out the "we" and put in "I",
and you've hit the spot... :P My jokes are getting worse...> Shouldn't we look
into it a little first?

RIKKU: And just who's gonna find it out for us?

???: Leave it to us!

^Yeivel bursts onto the scene. As in the one from earlier. And just where did
he get that RIDICULOUS hat?^

YEIVEL: Our leader Nurge should agree as well! I'll convince him myself!

WAKKA: Get outta here!

YEIVEL: Y-yessir! I'll return as soon as something has been learned! ::Bows and
leaves::

RIKKU: I think that Yunie ought to go herself.

WAKKA: That's impossible.

RIKKU: Why's that?

WAKKA: The next three months are completely booked. Everyone wants to meet
Yuna.

RIKKU: And what about what Yunie wants!

WAKKA: Well, y'know... Someday, when the world's settled down and all...

RIKKU: Whaddya mean, someday!? What's the matter with you, Wakka? Yunie always
worked so hard, she should only have to worry about herself now, so why!?
Everytime I come here, I always think about how everyone's busy finding their
own happiness... except for Yuna.

WAKKA: ::shrugs:: Well, that's...

RIKKU: ::runs towards Wakka:: Has your head gone as soft as your belly!? Yunie!

*YUNA*: I... I want to go. But if I leave, I may disappoint people.

YUNA: I...

^YUNA has a memory of Tidus saying something from some time back...^

Tidus: Well, if acting grown up means not being able to say what I want, then
screw it! Nothing'll change that way!

YUNA:: ::nods, then turns to Wakka and Rikku:: I'll go.

WAKKA: Yuna!!!
RIKKU <Same time as Wakka>: ::sighs with relief::

YUNA: After all... this is my story.

RIKKU: Ha! I knew you'd say that, so I went ahead and brought some stuff for
you. ::runs to the door::

WAKKA: ::slaps forehead:: Oh, no...

YUNA: First off, we gotta get you into some new clothes! You're famous after
all, so you'd better go undercover!

WAKKA: J--just a sec, ya? Lemme go get Lu.

*YUNA*: The Eternal Calm. It's my two minutes and forty one seconds and Wakka's
pudgy stomach. It's a small and quiet kind of happiness...  But... ::holds fist
to chest:: I guess I can ask for a little more, can't I?

YUNA: Rikku, let's get going!

^Screen whites out, a ship horn is heard... and...^

THE END. <Or FIN, whatever you prefer.>

*Frequently Asked Questions*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This ever expanding list of Question and Answers should be read by you! I still
get questions, which will go in here. Thankfully, I have received very few
questions which are answered here. Let's try and keep it that way!

If a * is beside a question or answer, it means it has recently been updated.

Q: How big is the file?
A: Thanks to Path2XTC for most of this info!
There are three known variations of this file. There are two .avi format ones,
which are approximately 104MB, or 106,900KB to be more precise and the much
much much larger 174MB (178,542KB) one. The .mpg file is 143MB (145,903KB).

Q: Which do you recommend, the .avi one, or the .mpg one?
A: Thanks to Path2XTC for most of this info!
"Believe it or not the smallest AVI at 104MB (106,900KB) is the best of the
three at a resolution of 640 x 480. This is why DivX is ruling, it IS the best
ever. [I'll add that you need the DivX codec for this one to run, more on that
later -Mouse] The largest is another AVI at 174MB (178,542KB) that is only 512
x 368 and the subtitles aren't as good. The last, the MPG, is 143MB (145,903KB)
with a pathetic resolution of about 350 x 200 (I'm not sure on the specific
resolution, because it never finished downloading), but the same subtitles as
the good AVI." Yet again, thanks to Path2XTC for that info!

Q: Is it worth downloading?
A: It depends on a number of factors. If you have broadband, the real thing is
a lot better than this script. If you're on dial-up, like me, I would say only
if you really really want to, as 104MB is no easy feat on a 56k.

Q: Where can I get it?
A: I reccommend that you use a P2P (Peer to Peer) program such as KaZaA or
Morpheus. Failing that, you could look around on some FFX fansites, but I
wouldn't be hopeful, and I don't know of any. It also comes bundled with FFX:
International, but only in Japan, and there are no subtitles.

Q: I have a P2P program, but can't find it amongst all the other FFX stuff!
A: I suggest refining your search to movie files only, and searching for "Final
Fantasy X". And if you're using KaZaA, check the description to see if it is
the subtitled one. I've heard rumours that there is a non-subtitled one
floating about.

Q: I'm on a modem, how do you suggest I download it?
A: I would then reccommend a P2P program, as it saves download progress. If
you've found a website, I suggest using a program such as Download Accelerator
Plus. You can get these at download.com.

Q: I downloaded the .avi version, and it's saying I need a codec!
A: To run most .avi versions, you need the DivX Codec, available at
download.com again.

Q: I'm looking for a Real Player version, as it's smaller. Do you know of any?
A: Nope, sorry. Gimme a shout if you find one.

Q: I'm on a Mac, so KaZaA and Morpheus don't work. What can I do?
A: From what I've heard, the P2P system for the Mac is rather ****. I suggest
you try and find a website.

Q: What do you think happens after what we see?
A: I can't really say, apart from the upcoming FFX spin-offs are based on after
this, or so I've heard.

*Q: What about this spin-off?
*A: Well, in my latest edition of UK Official PlayStation 2 Mag, it gives info
about the new spin off, Final Fantasy X-2. It's getting a preliminary release
date in the UK as September/October, but you might as well stick another few
months, so Q3 2003 - Q1 2004. This is the extract from the magazine (Along with
a nice pic of Yuna!) "For the first time, Square is reviving the story and
characters from one of its Final Fantasy Titles, rather than ditching
everything and starting from scratch. Set two years after FFX, Final Fantasy X-
2 follows the continuing adventurs of Yuna the Summoner. The cheeky minx has
now developed a bit of Lara Croft attitude sporting hotpants (!!!) and a pair
of pistols: she even has a few action scenes, leaping across chasms and
climbing rockfaces, usually Final Fantasy titles merely require characters to
wander from one place to another. Exciting stuff for lovers of RPGs, not to
mention lovers of girls in hotpants." So there you have it!

*Q: Will we get it in the US? We didn't get the Dark Aeons!
*A: To that, I have no idea, but I'm sure that you will. And probably before us
Europeans too!

Q: Why did Lulu and Kimahri not make appearances?
A: Kimahri didn't make an appearance because he was on Mount Gagazet, and there
really was no need to include him. Lulu didn't make an appearance because she
was quite well into pregnancy, if you guess from Yuna's comments early on. It
would be akward to alter her character model.

Q: Wakka doesn't look fat! Why do they keep going on about it?
A: As with Lulu, there's no point in altering the character model.

Q: Is this a story-setter for the upcoming Yuna and Rikku spin-offs?
A: The "spin-offs" are set just after this video. The added ending which came
on the extra DVD on the Japanese International version is the prelude to the
"spin-offs". No-one is sure at this point, but I would think that this is the
scene-setter for the Yuna and Rikku versions.

Q: Why was it never released in the English speaking world?
A: Thanks to Angelus for the following answer!
Well, since FFX: International wasn't released until after the NTSC (American
Version), the voice actors who played the parts had no need to record this
extra scene. Although over here in PAL territory we received the International
version, we still had the American voice-overs, after-all it would be way to
expensive and kinda pointless for Square-Europe to re-record all the voices.
But, because the American production was already complete Square weren't
willing to get back the voice actors to record a 10 minute scene, and is the
main reason other territories did not receive the extra ending. It would have
been possible for them to release it with the Japanese voice-overs and use
subtitles, but this would have made it look a little cheap, especially as after
several hours of gaming, you're used to hearing English voice-overs. Instead of
making it look incomplete Square decided not to include the scene at all.

Q: Will Final Fantasy X International work on my PAL PS2?
A: No. The only difference between the PAL version and International version is
the content of the extra DVD disc (And that you can play the game in Japanese).
It is better for you to download it than to buy it.

Q: Will Final Fantasy X International work on my American NTSC PS2?
A: No. If you want to import it, you either need a Japanese PS2, or you will
have to chip yours, which I severely do not recommend. Chipping is bad, and
also runs a rather high risk of damaging your PS2. I know someone who chipped
their PS2, and wrecked it. It was still under warranty, but it was voided. It
cost him L125 pounds to get it fixed (Around $200). Don't do it.

Q: I have Final Fantasy X International. I completed the game, and the extra
ending didn't show! What's going on?
A: I get this quite often. ;) The extra ending is on the extra DVD disc, it is
NOT in the game. You do NOT need to play the game to view the ending. Also, It
only comes with the Japaneese version of Final Fantasy X International, not the
generic Asian version. Many imported version come from Hong Kong - this version
does NOT include the extra ening. I'm pretty sure of this. Correct me if I'm
wrong.

XVIII) FAQ ---> A842
=============================================================================
=============================================================================

Greetings! In this section most commonly asked questions will be answered.

Q1 - I missed Destruction Sphere at Bevelle, but now I can't enter it again.
What can I do?
A1 - There is no way you can miss Destruction Sphere at Bevelle. You need to
pick it up and use it in order to be able to leave the temple when you first
visit it. Again I stress that there is no way in purgatory you could've missed
that sphere.

Q2 - I have PAL version of FFX and have beaten the game. I have also heard of
extra ending that is on DVD, but I don't get to view it once I beat the game.
After words The End appear, that's it.
A2 - That bit of 'ending' can only be seen on Bonus DVD that came along with
Japanese INT version. The movie you'd like to see sadly hasn't been put on
bonus DVD that came along with PAL FFX.

Q3 - How do I open that darn door in Remiem Temple? I wanna get Magus Sisters!
A3 - You need Flower Sceptre (get it by defeating Belgemine's Bahamut inside
Remiem Temple), Blossom Crown (capture at least one of each fiend from Calm
Lands and Gagazet, then arena manager hands it over). You'll also need to
obtain Anima and Yojimbo. Only then will you be able to remove the seal barring
the door and obtain final trio of aeons.

Q4 - I've entered Baaj Temple in order to get Anima. There're six statues in
there. Five of them lit up and one didn't. But I'm sure I got Destruction
Sphere from all temples I've visited so far. What gives?
A4 - You're missing Destruction Sphere from Zanarkand Temple. Return there.
Monitor shows white squares. You now need to step on all seven white squares
found in both parts of the temple. Once stepped on, pick up now revealed
Destruction Sphere. Go to the monitor in that other room. Insert it in one of
the holes. Collect Magistral Rod and sixth seal is broken. Return to Baaj
Temple and Anima is yours.

Q5 - Where is Tonberry in Cavern of S. F.? And what is the deal with Magic Urns
I so often run into?
A5 - Tonberry is one of rare fiends that's hard to encounter. As is common
belief on Gamefaqs FFX board, Tonberry can be encountered the most in far green
room. If even that doesn't work like it should, save your game and then reload.
As odd as it sounds, this seems to reset game's random encounter order and
frequency of which monsters you encounter, so this might help you find Tonberry
more often.
As for Magic Urns, no purpose has been found as of yet. Urns are only killable
with Yojimbo's Zanmato or by Dooming them (200 turns), but don't bother as you
get nothing in return. You may be interested in 'seven items' stuff you can
find in Urn's scan. That too hasn't been deciphered yet. Either you can get
seven different items from Urn or up to seven items in one battle, neither of
which I've been able to do. So for now, don't bother.

Q6 - There are some guys that won't let me enter the temples! What can I do?
A6 - Have you been to Highbridge yet? When Kimahri suggests so in one of the
scenes aboard the airship, Highbridge will become a destination on NavMap. Go
there, see the scene and you will no longer be prohibited from entering the
temples. BTW, recently I found out that you simply cannot miss talking to
Kimahri and Yuna in order for Highbridge to appear as a destination - you HAVE
to talk to both of them in order for the story to progress.

Q7 - Where the purgatory is eighth Cactuar Isrra? It's pretty obvious from the
clue he's supposed to be in the hole Sandragora was in before, but the bastard
is nowhere to be found.
A7 - You need to exit *Sanubia Desert - West* to *Sanubia Desert - Central* and
then reenter the West Desert. Recheck the sand traps and Isrra will be found in
one of them.

Q8 - Nemesis is still locked!
A8 - You need to capture 10 of every capturable fiend, you need to defeat all
Area creations, you need to defeat all Species creations, and you need to
defeat all seven Original creations (sans Nemesis, of course). Only after
you've done all that, Nemesis will be unlocked. Lastly, Nemesis is found under
Original creations, page two, which means you should press right once you enter
that submenu.

Q9 - I try to enter Besaid after I gain airship permanently, but I get my
behind handed to me by some flying bastard. What can I do? And... um, there's
an icy problem in front of Macalania temple. Tips?
A9 - You *have* to defeat this flying annoyance or 'wooohooo!'. One option is
boosting your stats a bit to stand better chances. The other is summoning
Yojimbo in battle and paying him all your gil, also hoping that random factor
is on your side and he'll do Zanmato.

Q10 - Help! I can't find Garuda, Qactuar, Simurgh etc. Oh, and I also heard
that this enemy most often pops up at this part. Can you take a pic of the
area?
A10 - I'm afraid I'll have to say no to this request. Based on my experience a
certain enemy tends to pop up just as often on one part of the background as it
does on the other. As it's often been said already, if you just can't seem to
capture certain enemy, save your game, then reset, then load lastly saved game
and try again. Monster encounter probability has changed with this, hopefully
for the better.
If I were to take a pic of the area and say: Simurgh pops up here for sure,
you'd go try it... and 10 Basilisks later you'd still be left resultless. I can
only provide you with two specific solutions:
- Qactuar can be fought in Thunder Plains, but only after you've prayed to a
Cactuar stone (you know, the ones that glow every so often) by pressing Square
button.
- Garuda can only be fought on Mushroom Rock: Precipice, and Mushroom Rock:
Valley. You will know so if you enter Triangle menu and examine lower left
corner where it says the name of the area.

Q11 - I need help with this and that boss!
A11 - Please! Use the strategies I wrote in the guide. I assure you that they
will help you win against whatever it is you're up against. Strategies I wrote
are result of lots of trial and error tests I ran when fighting those bosses.
If you still can't win, then next reason you aren't able to do so is cos you're
underpowered, in which case you should level up a bit. If you don't want to do
that, then get all of your aeons in overdrives and use them on bosses. This
alone should finally get you victory.
