----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Destroying Targets
------------------

Press either the L1 or R1 shoulder buttons to aim, and use the right analog
stick to control the crosshair. The crosshair should turn purple if your
intended target is in range.  Be sure to constantly adjust the camera, to
avoid getting awkward angles. R2 reloads your weapon, while L2 changes it.

Level Up
--------

You will receive the cumulative total of all the eperience points, from the
enemies you defeated at the end of each chapter, or upon getting KO'ed. You
can also choose to exchange the experience points for gil. But Vincent won't
level up if you do that.

Equipment Modification
----------------------

You can upgrade your equipments, (weapon and accessories) at vending 
machines for a certain fee of course. So decide properly whether you want
experience points or gil, every time you complete a chapter.

Mako Points
-----------

This is a spot of blue energy, which restores a moderate amount of MP when
stepped on. These things get recharged after a while.

Save Points
-----------

There are no save points in this game. Instead, it has an auto-save feature
which is triggered, whenever you reach a designated point within chapters.
You can also manually save by pausing the game, and selecting "Tempsave" 
from the menu. You'll automatically be taken back to the tite screen 
afterwards. Also, a tempsave file can only be loaded once, before the game
deletes it.

Items Inventory
---------------

You are only allowed to carry a limited number of consumable items. Here's

Performance Evaluation                                               [02b-2]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The game evaluates your performance at the end of each chapter, and gives
you a ranking. (S being highest, and D lowest) There are a number of factors
that will affect your rank:

Targets Destroyed : More enemies defeated = Higher rank.
Accuracy Rate     : Less missed shots = Higher rank.
Damage Sustained  : Less damage received = Higher rank.
Critical Hits     : More red damage values caused = Higher rank.
Killchains        : Kill more enemies in quick successions = Higher rank 
                    (Note that barrels and boxes also count.)
Items Used        : Less items consumed per chapter = Higher rank
Magic Casted      : More materia shots fired = Higher rank
Mako Collected    : More Mako Points found & used = Higher rank
Times KO'ed       : Fewer times died = Higher rank (KOs don't count if 
                    you're revived by a Phoenix Down.
Time Expired      : Faster chapter completion = Higher rank (Note that the
                    time you spend for watching cut-scenes will be counted.)

You also get evaluated for your performance in each of the stage missions
within a chapter.

                - Save the abducted girl. (Total: 1) -
                - Assist the WRO Members. (Total: 12) -
============================================================================

Kill the 3 soldiers on the roof. Move on and pick up the POTION. Climb the
ladder. Take out 2 more enemies, one of which drops 36 HANDGUN BULLETS. Take
a right at the split and destroy the crate for 500 GIL. Turn around and head
for the opposite direction. Now face west, then shoot the barrel to kill all
the soldiers at the other side. The northwest dead end has a POTION. 

Go back and head down several flights of stairs. There are 3 enemies to be
dispatched on your way down. You've now reached the main part of town. 
Protect the civilians by killing the DG Soldiers chasing them down. Continue
north for a couple of POTIONS. Make your to the southern part of the map to
find a boy that needs saving.

Return to the main path, turn left into an alley for the FIRE MATERIA. 
There's a Mako Point here as well. Moving on, take out another soldier, then
examine the laser gate to the north. An enemy will pop out from behind, so
kill her to pick up the Card Key. Use it to unlock the gate.

Dispatch all the enemies along the way. (The first one drops a LIMIT 
BREAKER.) After the cut-scene, it's time to go save another citizen. Take 
out all the soldiers around the area, some of which are shooting from the
windows above. The item cases contain a POTION, a PHOENIX DOWN & a HI-
POTION. Press X in front of the container to open it. Kill off the dog to
save Rio..

Back to the main path. Proceed to the west dead end for a SNIPER SCOPE. Now
turn into the other alley, and defeat all the soldiers to get the next CARD
KEY. Head to the laser gate and unlock it. 

Indoors! Finally! More enemies to clear. Head to the top floor for a PHOENIX
DOWN and 180 HANDGUN BULLETS. Go back downstairs then dispatch 4 more 
soldiers. One of them drops the LONG BARREL, so take it. Get a HI-POTION, 
along with some handgun bullets from the item cases. Exit through the door
for a sub-boss fight.

============================================================================
BATTLE: DRAGONFLY
============================================================================

Equip the Long Barrel and Fire Materia, then blast away. Just make sure no
other structures are in the way before you fire. A group of Deepground 
soldiers will drop from the chopper once you've done enough damage. Take 
them out. Also, there are breakable boxes with items, and several Mako 
Points around the area. Use them if necessary. As for the missiles, avoid 
them by jumping or dashing. 
============================================================================

You'll be indoors again. Pick up the SHORT BARREL. The first room to your
left has 500 GIL and 180 HANDGUN BULLETS. There's a vending machine in the 
second left room, so restock on items if necessary. Leave the room, then
grab a PHOENIX DOWN from behind the desk. Head upstairs for a cut-scene.

Equip the Short Barrel and start dispatching the horde of soldiers. There's
one that's a lot tougher than the rest, just keep shooting him and he'll go
down eventually. Another cut-scene. 

You'll regain control outside, where you'll be required to assist the WRO 
members. (A stage mission) Your main objective here is to get to the door
where there are stacks of boxes and several Mako Points nearby. It's 
pointless to try killing the enemies before the WRO members come in. 
You'll simply be wasting bullets, since the enemy supply is endless.
Proceed through the newly opened exit. 3 POTIONS can also be found in
the crates.

You can shop from the guy here if you need to. Grab the GRIFFON and 200 
MACHINE GUN BULLETS. Follow the WRO members, help them clear out all the 
enemy soldiers. Pick up the CERBERUS RELIEF from one of the DG soldiers.
Look around for a stack of boxes at a corner, and destroy them to get a
CARD KEY.

Unlock the laser gate leading to the dead end first. Behind it, you'll
find 500 GIL as well as another CARD KEY. Open the other gate. Moving
forward, jump onto the higher section to get 180 HANDGUN BULLETS. Continue
on towards the red dot on the map for a boss fight.           

============================================================================
BOSS: DRAGONFLY GL
============================================================================

The same thing from before with barely any improvements. Equip the Griffon
and start shooting. Once you've chained enough damage, the chopper will 
temporarily breakdown. All your bullets will deal critical damage during 
this time. Rinse and repeat until you destroy it. You can avoid the rockets
by running as they head towards you.

CHAPTER 02 : SHOWDOWN IN THE WASTES                                    [03b]
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

============================================================================
Stage Mission: - Eradicate the Guard Hounds. (Total: 70) -
============================================================================

This chapter starts out with you in the back of the truck, armed with a 
turret gun. Eliminate as many Guard Hounds as you can. A cut-scene 
eventually plays and you'll regain control on the roof of the truck. More
Guard Hounds to take out, followed by another cut-scene.

You'll be on foot now. Just keep heading northeast, towards the red dot on 
the map to proceed. There are 3 Mako Points at the south end of the 
mountain, so use them if you want a better score in your evaluation at the 
end of this stage.

============================================================================
BATTLE: CRIMSON HOUND
============================================================================

Equip the Long Barrel with your Handgun. Kill the Guard Hounds first, since 
one of them drops the Thunder Materia. The others drop some Handgun Bullets. 
As for your real target, it usually stays atop the cliffs, so keep your aim 
high and fire once you get a lock. 
============================================================================

Continue on towards your destination, and fight one more battle once you 
reach the top.

============================================================================
BATTLE: PEGASUS RIDERS
============================================================================

This is a 5 against 1 affair, and they will be circling around you. You can 
damage them here, but I suggest shooting each of them from the front, as 
they attempt to run you over. That way, you'll be able to eliminate one with
just a single shot. The last Mako Point is somewhere in this area.

Stage Missions: - Eliminate the Snipers in Hiding. (Total: 15) 
                - Protect the boy. (Total: 1) -
============================================================================

There's a vending machine nearby, so shop if you need to. Now make your way
to the dead end at the north side. The dog enemies here drop 60 MACHINE GUN
BULLETS. Climb the stairs, and go around until you see an item case below, 
containing 36 HANDGUN BULLETS.

Head for the alleyway at the northwest section of the area. There's a Mako
Point here. Approach the WRO Member for a cut-scene. Pick up the CARD KEY 
and go unlock the laser gate. Open the door to the Bar. Inside, grab the 
POTION, along with the HYDRA next to the stairs behind the counter.

Go up, get a total of 36 RIFLE BULLETS from 3 item cases, then exit through 
the door. Take out 4 enemies at the alley. Equip the Hydra. Continue on 
until you reach an open area. 

There are several snipers here, so running around is pretty much suicide. 
Pull out the Hydra and aim high, then pick off the snipers one by one. 
There's one hiding behind a crate at the central corner to the south. 
Destroy that box for 60 MACHINE GUN BULLETS, next to it is a Mako Point.

Follow the kid into the room. Kill 2 soldiers. Shop at the vending machine
if you want. (Modify the Cerberus II if you can afford it.) Head up the 
stairs. Pick up a couple of item cases containing a POTION and 150 
MACHINE GUN BULLETS. Return to the first floor. Follow the kid outside and
kill the 2 soldiers hiding at the corner. Proceed to the laser gate, then
kill 3 more soldiers. Approach the boy for a cut-scene.

Follow the boy, while protecting him from several enemies along the way.
Once you reach the last room, wait at the top of the stairs, and kill the
soldier to get your CARD KEY. After the cut-scene, you'll be back outside.
Head into the room at the east side to get the MODEL GUN. Go unlock the
laser gate to proceed.

From here, just make your way to the red dot at the southern part of the 
map. There are a lot of enemies on stand by along the way, so watch out.
Be sure to pick the HI POTION and 60 MACHINE GUN BULLETS too. The crate
at the top of some stairs contains 3000 GIL. Just shoot it, activate
your Limit Break, then jump to reach it. Keep going until you trigger a
short cut-scene. Kill the first soldier, then wait for the other 2 to
come down and take them out.

Continue onwards. Once you reach a fence with several enemies behind it,
shoot the explosive barrels to finish them off quickly. Restock at the 
vending machine. Enter the room for a boss fight.
         
============================================================================
BOSS: HEAVY ARMORED SOLDIER
============================================================================
      
Besides the large creature, some minor Deepground soldiers and 4 snipers 
will be joining this battle. The stairs can provide pretty good cover, so
go hide behind it if necessary. There really is nothing special about the
big guy. Just keep shooting him with your handgun. (An upgraded one will
be better.) Your bullets can destroy his missiles, so that shouldn't be a
problem. Do shoot him with the Fire materia as well.

When he starts coming your way, run as far away as you can. Since his sword
slash deals a lot of damage. You may want to kill off all the snipers, to
complete the earlier stage mission.

Stage Missions: - Assist the WRO Members! (Total: 20) -
                - Hurry to the Command Center! -
============================================================================

This chapter immediately starts out with a stage mission. Help the WRO 
Members clear out all DG soldiers. The boxes around here has bullets for
both handgun and rifle. (60 and 30 respectively.) There is a Mako Point here
as well. Climb up the left staircase. Head north at the top and destroy 2
more boxes for 30 MACHINE GUN & RIFLE BULLETS. 

Turn around going south, killing 3 soldiers along the way. Skip the stairs 
up, and get to the end of the hall, dispatching one more soldier for the 
CARD KEY. Unlock the gate by the stairs. Go up, then into the room. Check 
both ends for a LIMIT BREAKER & 30 RIFLE BULLETS. There's also a vending 
machine in here, so shop if you have to. Exit back to the hallway.   

Proceed into the room closest to the laser gate. Inside, take out the 
soldier, and exit through the other door. The northern dead end has a box
with a POTION, as well as a Mako Point. Turn back south, and up the stairs. 
Go all the way around to the north dead end at the right wing. Disptch the
soldier here to take his CARD KEY. Unlock the gate blocking the next flight
of stairs.

After the short cut-scene, head down the stairs, (the red dot on the map)
then go north. A sword-weilding guy will intercept you, so take care of him
and grab his GRAVITY FLOATER. Continue west then press the switch to 
activate the elevator. Now, there's a turret guy waiting for you here. 
Simply blow him away with the fire materia. Go in the room.

Just follow the solitary path leading to the command center, while getting
rid of some enemies along the way. After the cut-scene, run all the way 
back out of the room. Ride the elevator down and enter the room to the
northeast. Grab 60 HANDGUN BULLETS & a LIMIT BREAKER from the item cases.
Descend the stairs, then kill all the soldiers to get your CARD KEY & the
POWER CROSS.

Unlock the gate. Blast everything with the fire materia, and pick up one 
more CARD KEY. Open the next gate. Blast through another group of enemies
for the last CARD KEY. Go into the pool room to find a Mako Point. Head
further north through the door. Make use of the vending machine in here,
and once you're ready proceed throgh the other door for a boss fight.

============================================================================
BOSS: SHELKE THE TRANSPARENT
============================================================================

Don't bother wasting your bullets here, since you most probably won't hit 
her anyway. Instead, equip the Power Cross, use a Limit Breaker, and just 
melee her to death.
============================================================================

After that battle, leave the room for a cut-scene, followed by another boss
fight.

============================================================================
BOSS: AZUL THE CERULEAN
============================================================================

There are plenty of explosive barrels here. Shoot the ones he's standing 
close to for some serious damage. If the barrels are too far away from him,
just fire at Azul to get him walking. Then blow up the barrels once he gets
close enough. 

Avoid rooting yourself to single spot, since you wouldn't want to see how 
much damage that massive gun of his can do. Move away once he faces your 
direction, and you won't get hit at all. As for the shockwaves, simply jump 
over them.

Nibelheim Sewers
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

============================================================================
Stage Mission: - Eliminate the Sahagins. (Total: 33) -
============================================================================

Welcome to the Nibelheim Sewers! Now, remember that melee attacks work best 
against Sahagins, the only enemy you'll encounter down here. With that said, 
get rid of the ambush party. 

Moving on, check the corner pockets for a POTION & 72 HANDGUN BULLETS. The 
succeeding left side hole has a PHOENIX DOWN. Continue north, then right 
into the hole and climb up the ladder. At the top, go right for a Mako 
Point. Jump into the water, kill all the Sahagins, take the CARD KEY to 
unlock the gate. Make your way to the red dot on the map.

Drop into the water, then head south through the small tunnel. Climb up the
stairs and take the item case with 56 RIFLE BULLETS at the left hand corner.
Jump back into the water. Head up the ladder to the north. Take the 1000 
Gil, then get rid of the Sahagins in the tunnel. Go in and grab the LIMIT
BREAKER. Take the right hand path towards the next section. 

At the intersection, head left to get the BLIZZARD MATERIA. Turn around and 
go the other way. Check the side holes for a POTION & 40 RIFLE BULLETS.
Move on north and get rid of the Sahagin for the CARD KEY. Use it to unlock
the nearby gate. Grab 72 HANDGUN BULLETS inside, and you'll get locked in.
Just kill the bunch of enemies to get another CARD KEY. 

Unlock the west gate to get 2500 Gil. Turn back east up the ladder to find a
Mako Point. Continue along the path until you reach a switch. Press it to
open the gate blocking the exit. Jump down into the water and destroy the
boxes to get a POTION & some machine gun bullets. Make your way to the red 
dot on the map and out of the sewer.

There are plenty of enemies waiting up here, so take them out. Head to the
northeast section, then crouch to get through the small opening, into the
storage room. Grab both the 500 GIL and POWER BOOSTER. An infinite number of
enemies will suddenly appear afterwards, so hurry up and get out of there. 

Now go to the elevator. Ride it up to the second floor, then head down the
stairs to find a vending machine. If you don't need to shop, take the 
elevator directly up to the 3rd floor. Once there, go north for some items.
The shutters on both sides will close up and lock you in. Use your rifle to
take out all the enemies above, from either side. Continue up the stairs to
get finally reach the mansion.

============================================================================
Stage Mission: - Sneak by the DG Soldiers. (Total: 13) -
============================================================================

Your controls will switch over to Cait Sith now. He doesn't have any weapon,
so you'll have to sneak by as many enemy soldiers as possible to survive. 
Take the south stairs up and jump over the pipes. Wait for the soldier to 
get farther to the left, then run up and hide behind the box. Once the guy 
walks back to the to the right, run left, stop at the tip. 

Look down and you should see another soldier. Wait for him to the lower 
portion of his patrol area. Drop down. Climb up the ladder. For the next
group, wait for the left side guy to turn the other way. (back facing you)
Then follow him and turn towards the ladder. 

After the cut-scene, drop to the bottom, quickly turn around, and run behind
the steel ladder. Push the barrel to kill the enemy ahead. Do the same for
the next guard when you round the corner. Jump onto the crates to the hole.

In the next area, jump over the barrel. Push it once the guard passes by to
get rid of him. The next obstacle involves 2 guards patrolling in a circle.
Follow the soldier at the left side closely from behind, and drop onto the
pipes below. Move on a bit to trigger a cut-scene.

Back to Vincent. Head south through a couple of doors. After the cut-scene,
go to the east room and get rid of the 3 soldiers. Grab 60 HANDGUN and RIFLE
BULLETS. Return to the center room, go through the south door. There's a 
POTION in the item case here. Turn back west, then south to the hallway.

Take the left path into the first room. Pick up a LIMIT BREAKER, along with
60 HANDGUN BULLETS. Next, proceed into the other room. You'll find the 3rd
OMEGA REPORT in here. Go back to the hallway, and this time take the right
path south. Blast your way through several enemies. You've just reached an
underground cave. Destroy the box for a PHOENIX DOWN. Continue south, then
head east into the coffin room. The ninja in here drops 1000 GIL. 

Exit and follow the path until you reach a point, where you need to 
deactivate some land mines to proceed. There are 4 mines in the area, and
the faster the beeping gets, the closer you are to a land mine. Once you 
find them, back up a bit then fire at the mine. Get the CARD KEY for the
gate when you're done. 

At the next room, press the switch to activate the platform, then jump off 
once you get to the other side. There's a Mako Point at the bottom. You can
use the ladder to climb back up afterwards. Follow the path, turn west into
the room. Run all the way to the end to find 2 LIMIT BREAKERS and 70 MACHINE
GUN BULLETS. Go back outside. Move on further north to the red dot.

Now blast through all the enemies, as you make your way up the winding path.
At the second floor, head through the doors until you get to the manor's
foyer. Proceed to the west room, then kill the lone soldier. Grab an OMEGA 
REPORT from behind the barrels. Get out of there, and into the nearby room.
Destroy the box for 1500 GIL.

Annihilate all the enemies at the first floor. Go down and enter the east 
room, to find the another OMEGA REPORT behind the crates. Go back out.
Proceed to the west room. Defeat all the enemies, then leave through the
northeast door. From there, make your way around the room to the red dot,
picking up a total of 130 MACHINE GUN BULLETS along the way. 

At the next section, pick up the POTION then head northwest down the 
stairs. Try opening the door to trigger a cut-scene. Once you regain 
control, head for the red dot on the map. Be sure to buy some Ethers from
the vending machine. Continue towards the foyer for a boss fight.

============================================================================
BOSS: BLACK WIDOW
============================================================================

This machine has a devastating laser attack. Thankfully, you can completely
keep the spider from using it, by staying upstairs. Equip the Blizzard 
Materia, Cerberus, plus the Short Barrel.

Start off by firing magic, then immediately follow it up with a barrage of 
normal shots. In short, damage chaining is the best way to go here. The
spider is most vulnerable when it starts crawling along the walls.

Destroy 3 mobile artilleries for the CARD KEY. Unlock the gate to proceed.
Go along the path, while taking out enemies. (mostly guard hounds) You
should see the enemy camp once you reach the edge of the cliff. Take out
some more soldiers from your current spot. Also, you can watch the beetle
creatures bite your human enemies, just for fun. Kill the beetles with the
fire materia.

Drop down, kill some more some more soldiers. Loot the place for a POTION,
1100 GIL, 60 HANDGUN BULLETS & LIMIT BREAKER. Move along towards an open 
area and assist the WRO members, by shooting the barrels to clear out enemy 
soldiers. Now, sit on the turret gun and shoot down as many choppers as you
can. (A total of 15) The last chopper is the toughest to shoot down. 

After taking care of the last chopper, get off your sit. Kill all the
approaching sword-swinging guys to get the CARD KEY. Check around the area
for a POTION & 15 RIFLE BULLETS. Unlock the gate. There's a vending machine
and a Mako point in the next room. Go on outside.

This place is an enemy infested area. Use a Phoenix Down on yourself, as a
precautionary measure in case you get KOed. Use all the items you need to 
survive, since you can always go back to the previous room to shop. Once
you've cleaned up the place, look around to find a POTION & 120 MACHINE GUN
BULLETS. Proceed north ito the left door.

Just keep moving until you get outside. Clear some more enemies for the 
CARD KEY. Unlock the gate to reach the HQ Entrance. More enemies waiting to
be dispatched. Check the area for a POTION, 120 MACHINE GUN BULLETS, & 1000
GIL. Destroy the Black Widow at the entrance.

You're now inside the HQ. Most of the enemies are shooting from the beams
at the ceiling, it only takes a single shot to take them out. Again, look
around the area to get a POTION, 60 HANDGUN BULLETS, & 15 RIFLE BULLETS.
Proceed to the next room, clear out more enemies, then go into the northeast
room. Just follow the path, picking up another thousand gil along the way.
Head towards the red dot to trigger a cut-scene. Chapter complete.

This one is a story chapter. Simply involves running around the airship,
talking to people. Cid tells you to have a look around, so let's go do that.
Every single person here has something to say, so talk to them if you want.
But the only ones really need to speak to are Yuffie, Reeve and Shelke.

Yuffie is just outside the bridge. Shelke is in the central room of the
upper deck. While Reeve is in the east-most room on the upper deck. A
series of cut-scenes and FMVs follow.

Once you regain control, talk to the same group of people again. Talk to
Cid, Reeve & Yuffie 3 times, but only once to Shelke. There is a vending
machine in the room where Reeve is, that sells items real cheap. So be 
sure to fully restock your bullets here. Mega Potions, Elixirs, and 
X-Potions are also for sale from now on.

After talking to the said people, head to the lower deck, towards the area 
near the engine room to trigger another set of cut-scenes and FMVs.

blow up the barrels to make short work of the opposition. Go on to meet the
rest of the squad members. More enemies to take out. Pick up a HI-POTION at
the corner up ahead. Turn back, and go into the warehouse. Clear out another
group of soldiers to get the CARD KEY. Unlock the gate.

Clear out the place then head north to pick up the MEGA POTION, along with
an L ADJUSTER. (Dropped by a DG soldier.) After the cut-scene, dispatch 
some more soldiers atop the buildings. Proceed to the southwest sector and
kill the "sword guy" for your CARD KEY. Open the gate, continue north.
Trash all the robot sentries to get the next CARD KEY. Unlock the gate to
trigger some more cut-scenes.

Replenish your supplies at the vending if necessary. Otherwise, it's time
to move on. Make your way around the maze of trains until you get to a
huge open area. Once there, defeat all the enemies. Grab another CARD KEY
and unlock the gate further north. Just follow the path inside the tunnel to
the red dot, while blasting through all enemies on the way. You can also 
find a HI-POTION in here.

Outside, move through the next train maze. Cut-scene. You'll have to defeat
several aerial troopers, or the Shrikes. Just fire whenever they fly close
to a support beam above, and watch them crash into the steel beams.

There's a vending machine here, so shop if you need to. Move forward, then
clear out the southwest room for the CARD KEY. Unlock the gate. There are
whole of boxes in this area, which can used for cover. Dispatch some more
enemies. Grab a LIMIT BREAKER from atop the steel container, along with 
1000 GIL from one of the boxes. 

Contine along the path northwest. Take the CARD KEY from the next group of
soldiers, and go open another gate. Destroy the box here to find 1000 GIL.
Climb up the ladder afterwards. At the top, just run through the gates, 
once they open. Watch out for the maines hovering overhead, since those 
things deal a lot of damage. There's a POTION by the stairs at the end.

Run up the stairs and continue on, until a robot comes stomping in. Go hide
at the corner as the machine slams into the wall. Climb some more stairs,
and you'll come across a vending machine. There's a turret guy at the end of
the hall, so run up then drop into the shallow pit, and get rid of him from 
there. Continue forward. Sit behind the gun, and kill all the approaching
soldiers if you like. Go up the ladder nearby.

At the top, crouch by the gate up ahead, and provide some cover fire for
the guy deactivating the laser gate inside. Once done, enter the said
gate. Now take out all the soldiers at the top of the stairs. Climb up
and continue onward. Climb the laddder at the end for a LIMIT BREAKER, 10
RIFLE BULLETS, 50 MACHINE GUN BULLETS, 24 HANDGUN BULLETS, HI-POTION, &
the first G REPORT.

Go all the way back down, and out through the garage door. Go into the 
nearby room, kill all the enemies for the CARD KEY, and unlock the gate.
Press the elevator switch to activate it. At the next floor, defeat more
soldiers. Trash all the robot sentries upstairs. Destroy all the boxes for
some cash. Press the switch up ahead to activate the lift. 

Next floor, get rid of some more robot sentries, and a couple of turret 
guys. Head south, shop at the vending machine if necessary. Go through the
nearby door for a boss fight.

============================================================================
BOSS: ROSSO THE CRIMSON / BLOODBURST ROSSO
============================================================================
 
The first part of this fight is easy. Just hit her several times to trigger
a cut-scene, and then she gets serious afterwards. The disc blades she 
throws at you can be avoided by dashing, then jumping at the last moment.
A hit from this will knock you over, so be sure to press X or [] while 
you're airborne to get up quickly. 

Despite her fast movements, she does pause for a short time in between 
dashes. So take this opportunity to fire at her with your strongest weapon.
The pipes around the area provide good cover against the disc blades. 
Also, limit break melees do deal a lot of damage on her. (with the Power 
Cross equipped.) But since she moves fast, I recommend that you try to pin
her against a wall with the fire ball attack instead.

Before proceeding into the Shinra building, look around for plenty of items:
12 RIFLE BULLETS, 90 MACHINE GUN BULLETS, LIMIT BREAKER, 1000 GIL & PHOENIX
DOWN. In the building, defeat some ninjas, and climb up the right staircase.
Grab 12 RIFLE BULLETS at the northeast corner. Contine up the opposite 
staircase, grab 1000 GIL. From there, go north then drop into the pit.

Look around for a POTION & 36 HANDUN BULLETS. Now, go jump over the railing
at the southeast corner, towards the next section. Get 12 RIFLE BULLETS from
the northeast corner. Follow the path northwest. At the lower floor, look 
behind you to find a RED ETHER. Continue to the next room afterwards.

Take out a total of 4 enemies on the catwalks. Pick up 90 MACHINE GUN 
BULLETS, and go through the northeast exit. Go around a couple of rooms,
until you get to one with a beetle enemy. Shoot it and its other friends
will come to help. Dispatch them all, take the MEGA POTION, then exit out to
the hallway. 

Kill 3 soldiers, and take the 1000 GIL in the room. At the hallway, pick up
a couple of RED POTIONS west. Continue along the path to reach a vending 
machine, and through the door. Here, jump on the barrel positioned directly
under the item case. Jump again to grab it. The box contains 5000 GIL. Now
head north out to another hallway. 

Pick up 180 MACHINE GUN BULLETS, & 72 HANDGUN BULLETS. Follow the path north
west. Press the switch to open the door. After the cut-scene, press forward,
through some more doors. The beetle enemies are endless. Though I do suggest
defeating a few, to improve your evaluation scores at the end of this 
chapter. Go through the last door for a mini boss fight. 

============================================================================
BATTLE: BLACK WIDOW TW
============================================================================

There are 2 of these things here. And they also have that laser attack, 
similar to that of their friend, you fought back at Shinra Manor. Now equip
the Griffon + an upgraded Short Barrel, and fire away. Constantly strafe
sideways to avoid the laser. The spiders' machine gun fire are pretty weak,
so you should concentrate more on getting away from the giant laser.
============================================================================

Ride the elevator up. You'll now be in an unknown part of the Shinra 
building, with no map... joy! Anyway, you need to collect Deepground's top
secret data files. Take a look around the area to find a LIMIT BREAKER, 
along with a dozen RIFLE BULLETS. Now from the elevator, go northwest to
get hold of the first TOP SECRET FILE, behind the glass observation panels.
Ruturn to the elevator, and head south through a door from there.

Keep going forward for a couple of screens. You'll eventually reach the 
"display room". Make your way around the huge (and rather bare) place,
until you find the door that leads to the elevator platform. Go in for a
cut-scene. You finally get your map afterwards, thanks to Tifa. Move on.
In the next room, go around the walkway to get 108 HANDGUN BULLETS. Get on
the elevatot and press the switch to activate it.

You'll be surrounded by surveillance maines on the way up. Destroy as many
as you can before you get to the next floor. Once there, continue out the
door. Shop at the vending machine if you like. Go along the path north into
the room at the end of the hall. An item case with 90 MACHINE GUN BULLETS 
can be seen lying around along the way.

This section consists of 4 small rooms, connected to each other. Majority
of which are guarded by several enemies. Take them out and continue your
search for the top secret files. 3 out of the 4 rooms have files inside.
The southwest room has an exit that leads to the west side hallway. Go
there and proceed to the next elevator.

Grab another 108 HANDGUN BULLETS from the item case by the walkway. Activate
lift to go up. More surveillance mines to destroy. But this time, they spin
around you really fast, and destroying one can trigger a major chain 
reaction. Be careful about this, since getting hit by an explosion can cause
serious damage. Move on to your destination once you reach the next floor.

You will be at Shinra's Quarantine Facility. Shop and grab the X-POTION. 
Head to red dot for a boss fight.

BOSS: NEO AZUL
============================================================================

First part is the easy part. Just keep shooting him with your strongest 
weapon, and back up as he approaches. For his beast form, he'll be hot on 
your heels the whole time, so run. If you're gonna use magic, go for 
Blizzard. (It does the most damage on him) Normal guns don't help much 
either. The best thing to do here is just to equip the Power Cross, use a
Limit Breaker, and melee him to death. Back away after a few melee hits,
to avoid getting swiped.

============================================================================

Grab 90 HANDGUN BULLETS downstairs. Defeat the group of enemies that appear
(8 Gargoyles, some soldiers and a sword guy) to get the CARD KEY. Unlock the
gate, drop to the lower section. Pick up the OMEGA REPORT behind you. 
Continue to the red dot towards the outer wall's interior. Here, you'll have
a couple more CARD KEYS to get. Move on to the next sector.

These group of soldiers are protected by a force field. Maybe the barrier
can be broken with several shots, I'm not sure. So use melee attacks or 
magics instead. Another CARD KEY along with a LIMIT BREAKER. Unlock the
gate, proceed to the southwest door. 

Here, make your way to the bottom sector. Destroy the boxes for some items
and the CARD KEY. Go unlock the barricade upstairs. Head for the door to the
next room. Watch your step here to avoid getting hit by the hail of bullets
coming from the ceiling. Once you get on the cart, aim behind you and take
out all the enemies in pursuit. 

At the ruins, you'll find a vending machine, so replenish your supplies if 
needed. Destroy the box for an ETHER. Go southwest, defeat some "barrier
soldiers to get the CARD KEY. Proceed along the catwalk and down the stairs,
onto the rooftops. Check the other side of the roof to find the second 
G REPORT. Backtrack down the stairs, and unlock the gate. Kill 3 ninja 
enemies for another CARD KEY. Take out one more soldier in the next room to
get yet another CARD KEY.

Drop below after unlocking the barricade. Get the X-POTION. Keep going down
to the bottom area. You can obtain the BLAST MACHINE GUN at the opposite end
of the barricade. Defeat the horde of Guard & Crimson Hounds for the CARD 
KEY to get out. Now make your way upstairs, while blasting through all the
enemies. When you get to around E-9, aim for the box atop some balcony to
make it fall. Head towards the spot where it had fallen to get the FAERIE L
BARREL. 

Follow the path and you'll eventually be surrounded by several barricades.
Go south, man the turret gun, and blast the horde of enemies up ahead. Once
done, go pick up the CARD KEY. Unlock the gate. Go downstairs to the ground
level. There's an ELIXIR in the item case on top of the stairs. Check around
the area for plenty of ammo: 60 MACHINE GUN BULLETS, 36 HANDGUN BULLETS, &
12 RIFLE BULLETS. From the spot where you found the rifle ammos, head up the
stairs around the corner.

There's a vending machine here. Continue eastward, and defeat the horde of
soldiers for one more CARD KEY. Grab the LIMIT BREAKER, then unlock the gate
for a cut-scene.

Get 36 HANDGUN BULLETS from under the stairs, as well as 12 RIFLE BULLETS &
60 MACHINE GUN BULLETS on the way up. Kill a couple of soldiers for CARD 
KEY, and proceed further up. Now you have to obtain several card keys as you
move along, to unlock the barricades. There will be traps along the way. Go
downstairs. Pick up a dozen RIFLE BULLETS. Defeat the enemies outside. (Some
on the roof, others on the ground. 

Continue further down. Dispatch of all the enemies by the exit. Grab the 
CARD KEY and unlock the barricade. There's an item case containing 3000 GIL, 
along with a Mako Point nearby. Descend another flight of stairs. The left
door leads to a vending machine, and go through the right one to proceed.
Drop down below, then go east into the tunnel. Aim at the ceiling and shoot
the mine for the first CARD KEY in this barricade puzzle.

Contunue further in, and go through the small passage along the left wall.
Unlock the barricade at the top for the BAYONET RIFLE. Next, man the turret
gun, shoot the box at the top of the cliffs. That box contains another CARD
KEY. Make your way back out of the tunnel. Grab the CARD KEY. The nearby
barricade keeps an ELIXOR. 

Go the opposite direction from the tunnel entrance, unlock the gate there to 
get hold of 2 more CARD KEYS. Head back to room with the turret gun. Drop 
down the nearby pit. Defeat all the soldiers, grab the MEGA POTION. There 
are 2 ladders here, climb up one of the ladders to get another CARD KEY.    
The barricade below contains a LIMIT BREAKER. Keep going up the ladders. At
the top, continue north to the red dot. Boss fight. 
    
============================================================================
BOSS: NERO THE SABLE
============================================================================

Shoot him with your strongest combination of equipments. The P Cerberus 
Gamma worked well for me. Jump over him when he tries to get close with his
spinning attack. He'll eventually summon 2 dopplegangers. Only the real Nero
will receive damage, so spend a bullet on each copy. If your target does not
receive damage, then switch to another one. Limit Breaks are also worth a 
try. And finally, Nero is invulnerable whenever he's surrounded by the 
purple aura.

                - Defeat the Gargoyles! 3 (Total: 9)
============================================================================

Grab a caseful of HANDGUN BULLETS as well as a HI-POTION. There's a Mako 
Point here too. Moving on, you'll be confronted by plenty of "barrier 
soldiers". Just get rid of the first couple of them, then run to the left
intersection to reach a door. You'll find a vending machine inside. At the
next area, head down several flights of stairs to another door. Be sure to
pick up the case with 51 HANDGUN BULLETS along the way.

Drop to the lower walkway for 20 RIFLE BULLETS. Dispatch another group of
barrier soldiers and a launcher guy. Grab the CARD KEY, and unlock the 
south barricade. Jump on the platform to get the MEGA POTION. After that,
jump down onto the pipe below and again over the small gap. There are a lot
of item cases here, all of them containing 100 GIL. Step on the Mako Point
to summon a horde of beetles. Fight them off for one more CARD KEY.

You'll encounter some more Gargoyles in the next room. Continue downstairs
to another door. Plenty of bullets waiting to be picked up (51 HANDGUN, 20 
RIFLE & 80 MACHINE GUN BULLETS. You'll have yo defeat all the enemies on 
the central pillar. The quickest way to do this is to aim for the barrels
just above the pillar, and blow them up once they fall next to the soldiers.
Head for the door to the next room.

Pick up an X-POTION & a HI-POTION. Eliminate more Gargoyles. Just use the
turret gun to shoot them down. Go downstairs into yet another room. Shop at
the vending machiene if needed. After the cut-scene, take CARD KEY from the
barrier soldier, and unlock the gate. Run towards the other soldier, who's
pushing the turret gun, and take him out. Continue through several empty
rooms, until you reach one with enemies shooting at you from the ceiling.

Use magic to take out the one closest to you, and make a run for it. Defeat
the beetle horde to get your CARD KEY. Unlock the gate, and go to the next
area. The enemies in this elevator room are endless, so run towards the 
door diectly ahead. There's a G-REPORT in here, but I recommend coming back 
after the game saves your progress. Take the bullets and the HI-POTION. 
the switch, head out, boss fight. 

============================================================================
BOSS: DRAGONFLY PT
============================================================================

Attach a long-range barrel to your machine gun, (preferably the Blast 
Machine Gun) and fire away. Do make sure its not hiding behind any obstacle
before shooting. The Gargoyles are definitely a nuisance so shoot them down 
if there's one flying nearby. The sentry robots always drop bullets or items. 
Lastly make use of the pillars as cover against PT's missiles.
============================================================================
 
Now go back to the elevator room. Use a Limit Breaker to get rid of the 
enemies quickly. Once the circular platform in the middle of the room
starts to ascend, jump on it. Face the direction of the "door" at the
top, them jump on the pipe. The G REPORT is at the dead end opposite of the
door. 

Return to the room where you fought PT and go north. Press the sitch to
proceed. Defeat the horde of barrier soldiers using the fire materia. Make
use of the vending machine, continue to the next room, another boss fight.

============================================================================
BOSS: ARACHNERO / GORGONERO
============================================================================

Take out the 4 beam cannons first. Shoot them as they prepare to fire. Once
they're gone, fire a few shots at Nero's barrier to break it. At this point,
hit him with the Blizzard materia, and quickly follow through with normal
shots -- this will chain the damage. If you run of MP, just use your 
strongest weapon on him. (Preferably a handgun or a rifle.) The fire balls 
can knock you down, so try to avoid them as much as possible. Rinse and 
repeat until you win.

For Gorgonero, just remember that he'll pop up at the area with a purple-
black aura. Aim at that spot and shoot him once he appears. 
============================================================================

Get 5000 GIL from the item case. Replenish your supplies at the vending
machine, and continue east. Boss fight... again. There's no way you can win
against Weiss the Immaculate, so just let him kill you. After the cut-scene,
the real fight begins.

============================================================================
BOSS: WEISS EMPOWERED   
============================================================================

Stay as far away from him as possible at all times. And fire away with your
strongest weapon. (better if it's "P Class") Constantly strafe sideways to
keep up with his as he moves around. If he dashes towards you, back up and
keep shooting. For the sonic blades, strafe sideways or hide behind the 
glass tubes. He can also use his staff to block your bullets, so wait for a 
few moments, after he lowers it before you attack again. And finally, you
can avoid his missiles by hiding behind the tubes, or by dashing then 
jumping at the last moment.

Vincent will be in demon form here, with the Death Penalty in his 
possession. That gun can kill everything here in a single shot, so try it
out for a bit if you like. Again, make your way to the red dot on the map.
There's only one available path to follow here so go on. Take a sharp 
left at the split path near the starting point, to get an ELIXIR (if you 
need one.)

In the next area, blast your way through the enemies and head for the upper
level. The first of the last 2 OMEGA REPORTS is tucked in the small space 
between the stack of crates, and the giant cylinder tank to the north. Once
you reach the circular path, go towards the opposite direction for the last
OMEGA REPORT. Turn back and take the stairs up. Defeat all the enemies.

After the FMV, kill some more enemies as you fly through the tunnel. Real
nice music here. In the next room, keep defeating the flying enemies, until 
you trigger a cut-scene. When you regain control, go along the spiral
paths to top. Step on the circle. Continue forward. Chapter 12A complete.

Hopefully you did take some time to shop for bullets, before you started 
this chapter. You'll be fighting the last 3 battles of the game.

============================================================================
BOSS: CRYSTAL FEELERS & OMEGA COCOON
============================================================================

Do bother to take out the spawning flying creatures with your ordinary
guns, since they drop bullets for the Death Penalty. (This is why I told 
you to buy bullets at the shop.) Keep blasting enemies until you have at
least 350 Death Penalty Bullets. (Yes, you'll need lots of it later, though
not that much.) 

As for the feelers, approach them once they open, and use melee attacks.
The crystals remain exposed, as long as you don't kill off all the flying
enemies.

Omega Cocoon appears once all the Crystal Feelers are destroyed. Keep
shooting it with the Death Penalty, while taking out the minor enemies that
spawn. 
============================================================================

============================================================================
FINAL BOSS: OMEGA WEISS
============================================================================

The explosion from the Death Penalty will damage both Weiss & Omega. Their
offensives are quite deadly, but fortunately most can be avoided by 
Vincent's enhanced dash ability. Don't get too close to this boss, since it
attempts to flatten you with its fist. When he puts a shield of small blue
panels, quickly destroy it before he uses it as a weapon.

Sometimes, Weiss gets off his craft to attack you himself. His moves are
very similar to that of Shelke (when you fought her back in Chapter 4.) When
this happens, make sure you shoot him and he'll rejoin Omega. Eventually,
Omega will start glowing -- which gives it a huge boost in defense. It also
becomes a lot more agressive at this point, constantly unloading missiles on
you. Avoid them by dashing, then jumping as the missiles approach.

These capsules are hidden targets scattered throughout the game. Shoot them
to unlock cut-scene entries in the Event Viewer extra feature. The game
automatically saves your progress for every capsule destroyed. So you won't
ever find them again, unless you delete the game's save file from your 
memory card.

             that you're overlooking the rooftops. The capsule is on the
             white chimney of a house. The target is pretty small, and 
             therefore hard to spot.

Capsule 02 : After obtaining the first card key, unlock the laser gate and
             go to around I-10. (Near the Mako Point) Turn north, and aim
             high at the window of the houses. It's at the 1st or 2nd house
             to the right of the Mako Point.

             stage mission) head to around H-6 and turn south. Aim towards
             the roof of a house with a fence. 

Capsule 05 : In the shed where you found the Long Barrel. It's tucked in
             between 2 crates under the stairs.

Capsule 06 : After obtaining the Griffon, jump on the second crate to the 
             right and aim towards the rooftops. You should spot it on the
             rusted balcony of a house to the left side. 

Capsule 07 : Grab the 4th card key and head to around G-8. The capsule is in
             the fire towards the north side.

Capsule 08 : From where you got the 180 Handgun Bullets, (near a Mako Point)
             aim along the rooftops. You'll find the capsule between the

| Quite a few of my colleagues come to the conclusion that, Omega may be   |
| the fabled "promised land" to which the legend states that Centra are to |
| lead us. However, I still have my doubts. If Omega were an actual        |
| location, then how could Chaos be its "squire to the lofty heavens"?     |
|                                                                          |

| Review of several dated reports of our Lifestream has shed new light to  |
| my many theories about the Centa inscription. Just as we are born from   |
| the flowing matter below our feet, I now believe that Chaos and Omega    |
| may also be sentient life forms that the planet creates at its own will  |
|                                                                          |
| If we were able to discover the exact location where these two beings    |
| are to be born, the scientific repurcussions would be enormous.          |
|                                                                          |
| I was informed by a fellow paleontologist this morning that the new      |
| company had discovered another Centra artifact, and a new large-scale    |
| research project was scheduled to begin. She also said that my           |
| assistant had been offered a place on the team.                          |

| Omega... Part of a system created by our world to preserve the constant  |
| circulation of life. And therein lies the key to solving this mystery... |
| For many years it has been documented that local legends not only speak  | 
| of this phenomenon in terms of a planetary scale, but also suggest that  |
| the entire cosmos may follow the same rules.                             |

| I must say, I am quite pleased with the work of my fine assistant. Her   |
| ardent approach to the tasks before her will most certainly lead us to   |

| The spring that Dr. Valentine discovered is amazing! I am certain that   |
| it is some sort of reservoir for the "terra corrupt" mentioned on the    |
| Centra tablet.                                                           |

| The doctor believes the crystalline spring contains contaminated         |
| deposits of bioplasma that have overflown from the pure Lifestream. In   |
| fact, all of our readings indicate a strange type of energy radiating    |
| from the site. Could this grotto be the location where the legendary     |
| Chaos is destined to be born?                                            |

| My conscience tells me that I must leave some sort of record             |
| documenting all that I have attempted.                                   |

| I have determined the materia found by Dr. Valentine at the fountain of  |
| Chaos to be a type of refined anti-matter formed within the grotto over  |
| the past several millenia.                                               |
|                                                                          |
| I believe the planet created this instrument out of necessity as a       |
| means to control Chaos and prolong its own inevitable fate.              |
|                                                                          |
| By controlling Chaos, the planet also succeeds in preventing the advent  |
| of Omega. If Chaos is allowed to fulfill his destiny of destruction,     |
| Omega's awakening cannot be far behind.                                  |
|                                                                          |

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| The Shinra Company is feared across the globe for its ruthless army,     |
| SOLDIER.                                                                 |

| While one is well known: the infamous "S" -- a symbol of strength and    |
| destruction -- the other remains shrouded in an eldritch veil of         |
| shadows. All records of this man's existence have been deleted, the      |
| only remnant of his legacy being the lone letter "G".                    |

| There are rumors that he was a biochemically constructed prototype for   |
| the soldier who would become "S". However, there are no documents to     |
| support these claims. In fact, there is so little information on "G"     |
| that his existance may be nothing but a fabrication.                     |

| The only thing that may give insight into this mystery is a lone         |
| personnel record which  indicates that several years ago, a soldier 1st  |
| class was assigned a top-secret mission to pursue a target referred to   |
| only as "G". Unfortunately, any further data on this mission has been    |
