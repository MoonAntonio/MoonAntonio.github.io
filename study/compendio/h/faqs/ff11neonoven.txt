I know most people don't read these, but it needs to be done. I hate having
to write this just as much as you do having to read this. I wish this wasn't 
needed, but we have people out there (thanks to omlette for finding a typo)
today who would just steal anything just to call it their own. Anyway, 
enough said about that, on with the legal stuff.

II.  Version History                                      |
----------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.1
12/02/03 

I began starting the FAQ and I setup the table of contents. I also finished the
copyright information, introduction and I began this version history section.

Version 0.5
12/03/03

I finished the Understanding the Auction House section and I shall soon 
being on the main portion of the FAQ. 

Version 0.7
12/10/03

Began the Auction House Item list and I fix some typos and errors. I also added
a new tip in the Understanding the Auction House section. I'm thinking about 
expanding the list to more then just Bastok. If I decided to do that, I will 
notify you in the next version.

Version 0.8
12/13/03

Progress has been pretty good and the list should be complete soon. I went to 
Jeuno to get my Chocobo License and to kill some time I decided to get the list
for Jeuno as well. So, I added some more items to the list. I added the ones 
that the Bastok Auction House didn't have, so I'm on my way to a more complete 
list. Anyway, thanks for your patience on this matter. It should be done soon.

Version 0.9
12/17/03

A setback has come forth. An update was released on 12/15/03 for FFXI and within
the update they reorganized the categories on the Auction House. They gave 
Crystals and Food their own category. The Food and Other categories are now
broken down into sub-categories. They also added sub-categories to other areas 
as well. So, now I have to go back and readjust the Item list to appropriately 
accord to the now new order of the categories. After I reorganize this situation
I can continue on to finishing the remainder of the list. Also, I will be 
leaving December 19th for Florida to spend my Christmas Holiday with my family. 
So, that will also set me back a week. I will adjust list to the fit the new 
update before I go, but I won't be able to make any additions to the list till I
return. I apologize for the setbacks.

Version 1.0
12/29/03

I'm back from my vacation in Florida and I return bearing gifts! I have finished
the list and that brings this FAQ to its full version. I have also added some
new final concepts. I will of course update from time to time as I know new 
items appear on the Auction House frequently. Well, hopefully everyone enjoys 
the full list!

Version 1.1
01/14/04

I've added a few little things here and there, plus I also fixed some typos. I 
have now traveled to each city that has an Auction House. I have gotten the 
lists from Bastok, Windurst, Jeuno, and San d'Oria and have combined them all 
into one big final list. I will periodically add new items to the list when 
necessary.

Version 1.2
08/08/04

After eight months of no Final Fantasy XI, I can finally say I'm back. I had to 
quit due to financial situations. I had lost my job and I simply didn't want to 
have any excess bills adding up. So, I lost my previous level 28 Warrior, but
now I am back with a Black Mage. I'm sure there has been a bunch load of new 
items added to the Auction House since my absence, but due to my low level I 
can't travel to Jeuno quite yet to obtain a better list. I may look at my 
Auction House in Windurst and add a few items here or there. So, look forward to
more updates in the future.

III. Introduction                                         |
----------------------------------------------------------

I was at the Auction House in Bastok and I was browsing through the item lists
looking for a specific item. I didn't know what category my item was under
and I looked for what seemed like forever. I eventually found it, but it took
way too long to find my item. I assumed many others were also having the same
problem, especially those new to the game. I was curious if anyone had a 
list of what item goes where. After searching for a while, I found nothing 
and this is how this FAQ began. I thought it would interesting to write a
FAQ that labeled what items go with what category. Hopefully this FAQ can 
help you determine what items are where, so you can quickly buy that item 
before someone else does. Also, I hope this FAQ can help you better understand
how the Auction House works, so you can use this great feature in the game 
to its fullest capacity. So, that's the history of how this FAQ came about. 
Without further delay, it's time to advance to the useful part of the FAQ!

IV.  Understanding the Auction House                      |
----------------------------------------------------------

If you would like to join a party or just meet people and can't find a place to
do so, this is a great place to start. The Auction House, no matter what city, 
always contains a large mass of people all bundled into one small place. 
Auction Houses are usually placed somewhere on each map of a major city. Most 
commonly they are placed in the middle of a Market. You will know you are at an
Auction House when you see wooden counters and all the people standing around 
these counters. You can also find Auction Houses without counters. In some 
cities, Jeuno for example, there are NPCs who you can talk to that will initiate
an Auction House. A good way to tell if a NPC is being used as an Auction House 
is by checking the number of people around it. Usually large crowds don't all 
talk to NPCs unless it's an Auction House or an important mission or quest.

I'm sure you’re sitting there asking what makes the Auction House so special?
It's special for many reasons. It's most special quality is the ability to make
some decent gil. You can sell your goods here and make good money. The downfall
with selling goods though is that it takes time for people to purchase your 
goods. You sell your goods based on the price history of that item and if you
stay within the price stated in the history it should sell quickly. The price
history of item can be found by trying to purchase the same item you are 
trying to sell. When you go to purchase or bid you would select that item and
then select its price history and then jot it down. Then you would go back and
sell your item for the price that you wrote down and it will eventually sell. Of
course, another quality is the ability to buy various equipment, usually not
sold in most stores. If you need a certain sword or armor, your best bet is to
search the Auction House. 

I'm sure you're wondering what happens to your money when it sells. It's quite 
simple actually. When your item sells the money it sold for will be 
immediately sent to your delivery box at your Mog House. If you begin to sell 
an item and it's not selling fast enough or you put in on sale by accident you 
can easily take it of by selecting the sales status from the Auction House 
initial menu. If one of your items happens to sell you also need to go to sales 
status and take the sold item off the list so you can fit more on the sales 
list. All sold items are a sand color and all non-sold are green. Be sure to
keep up with that, because you are limited to only 7 items on your sales list.
From the sales list you can also check price history to see if the price of the
item you were trying to sell has changed. If your item is not selling go back
and check the sales status and make sure the value of the item hasn't dropped.

Now to sell goods there has to be people out there who actually bid on them. If 
you can't find a particular item I'm sure you can find it at the Auction House. 
To search for items select bid and categories of items will pop up. I will have 
a list of what item is where later on in this FAQ. After you have found what 
you would like to purchase select the item and once again you will be able 
to check the price history of that item so you know how much to bid. Once
you have check the price select bid and then enter the price you found out 
from the price history. Once you have entered you price, at the top of the 
screen it will say placing bid. A few seconds later in the log window it will
say if you were able to purchase the item or if you were unable to. If you
were, congratulations on your purchase. All purchased items go straight to your
inventory and not to your delivery box. Money from sold items and unsold goods
go to the delivery box. If you were unable to buy your item, play with numbers a
little and you will eventually be able to buy it. I've never had to buy and item
for much more then what the highest price on the history list. 

I'm sure for some items you have seen mixed prices on the price history. This
happens often and it's an important thing to take note of. For instance, if an
item had sold 5 times for 50 gil, 5 times for 100 gil, and 1 time for 150 gil 
you might have to set your price for bid/sell to somewhere in the middle. If 
you’re selling your item and there is fluctuation in the price history I would 
try selling it for the price of the most common price on the list. So, if there 
are 7 for 50 gil and 3 for 100 gil, I would sell it for 50 Gil as you will have 
a better chance of getting it sold. When bidding for items I usually start with
the lowest price on the price history and then work my way up. Sometimes you can
actually get the item for the cheapest price on the list and you save yourself
some decent money. 

Also, another important thing to know about the Auction House is how they work
from city to city and world to world. For example, I play in world/server of
Carbuncle and I live in Bastok. My items on my world in Bastok are different 
from the items in Bastok on a different world. This also applies for cities
in the same world. If I were to go to Windurst the prices at Windurst would
differ from the prices at Bastok. This is good to know if you have friends on
the same server at a different city. You might be able to ask your friend to 
buy the item your looking for at his Auction House for cheaper. He then could
send it to you and you could send the money to him in return and you can save 
money. For example if you want a fire crystal and it's priced at 250 gil at
you’re Auction House and you only have 200 gil you might want to ask your 
friend if it's cheaper at their Auction House. At their Auction House it may 
only be 200 gil, so you could give them the money and they could send you the 
item or vice versa. (Thanks to bpfinsa for this information.)

----------------------------------------------------------

Ok, you might be sitting there going what the hell did all that mean in 
English. So I'm going to show you how to buy and sell in more depth using
actual terms.


The Auction House Initial Menu -

First when you come to the Auction House target the wooden window looking thing 
and the main menu will pop up. You will have three options to choose from:

Bid 
Sell
Sales Status


Bidding - 

If you would like to bid for items select bid and categories will appear and 
they should be as follows: (Changed as of 12/15/03)

Weapons
Armor
Scrolls
Medicines
Furnishings
Materials
Food
Crystals
Others

Each category when selected brings up sub-categories except for Furnishings, 
Crystals and Medicines. I have a full detailed list of what item is what and 
where it is and it is further down in the FAQ. For this example we will try to 
buy a weapon. Select Weapons and a whole bunch of weapon types will appear. 
We'll purchase a sword. So, select Swords from the list. A list of available 
swords will appear. For the example will try to buy an Onion sword. If for some 
reason the Onion sword is not at your Auction House just choose a sword you'd 
like. Select the Onion sword, or which ever sword you chose, and three more 
options will come about:

Price History
Bid
Sort

Select Price History and a window will pop up and it will have different prices
that the weapon has sold at. On my world, in Bastok, the Onion Sword is sold 
for from 50 gil to 200 gil. The prices for the Onion sword may vary from world 
to world and city-to-city. Take the lowest price for the Onion sword or the 
sword you chose and write it down. Also take the highest price from the list
and copy it down. No back up and select the Onion sword or your sword again
and this time select bid. A price range bar will pop up and you can adjust
the price. I recommend starting from the lowest price on the history list
and working your way up. So for the Onion sword on my world I would start 
with 50 gil. For you, use the lowest price of the Onion sword in your world
and in your city and start with that. If you chose a different sword, also
start with the lowest price and go from there. I would move left once on the 
range bar to get two digits. Every time you move left on the bar it adds a 
digit. So I would move left once and up 5 times to get to a price of 50 gil. 
I would then select bid and hit enter. A message will appear at the top saying
Placing Bid. After a few moments a message will appear in the log window saying
either you were able to buy the Onion sword for 50 gil or you were unable to buy
the Onion sword for 50 gil. The text would of course change to fit your
parameters. If you were able to get the sword for the cheap price, pat yourself
on the back, because you have good luck and you usually can't get it for the
cheapest price. If you were unable to buy the sword continue adding some to the
price of your bid until you are able to purchase it. Sometimes you might have to
go over the highest price on the history list, but that is rare. 

Swords and weapons that you can equip will be highlighted in a sand color. Just
because you can't equip a weapon doesn't mean you can't bid for it. There are 
occasions when you can't bid on items that are on the list. If an item you are 
looking for has something like this next to it [1], then you can bid 
on that item. If there is no number next to it then you cannot bid, 
because that item is not being sold by anybody. If you want to see the list in 
a certain order, select the item you want and select sort. With sort you can 
sort the categories by damage, delay, level, job, and race. To return to the 
list without sorting just click escape or select To List. Sorting is a good way
to find out what items you can buy and equip. When you sort by level it sorts
by the highest level. So if your level 10, you will want to scroll all the way
down to the bottom. All the items you can equip will be arranged in a neat
order at the bottom of the list. This makes it easier for you to determine the
best possible equipment that your character can equip. 

That's about it for bidding.


Selling - 

If you would like to sell some of your items select sell and your inventory 
list will appear. Browse through your item list and select the items you wish 
to sell. Remember though that you can't sell items that are stacked that 
haven't reached the quantity of 12 or 99. So if you have 5 Flint Stones you 
can't sell them until you gather 12 of them. You can sell only items that have 
the quantity of 1, 12, or 99. Most items are stacked by twelve, but if you 
are in need of arrows, shurikens, or other ammo they are usually stacked by 99.
Not all items can sell as stacks of 12 or 99. Some items can sell at 99 and not 
at 12, and some items can sell for 12 and not 99. If you need to know what can 
sell for 99 or 12, check The Auction House Item List, which follows this 
section. 
 
Before you sell your items go back to bid and follow the same process as above 
to find out the price history of the item you are about to sell. Take note that
if you are selling a stack of 12 or 99 select the item that has a pink 12 or 99
next to it to find out the history of the stack. If you are selling just 1 
of the item just select the one without the pink number. Like with bidding 
write down the highest and lowest prices. Now go back to sell and select the 
item. Once you have chosen your item or stack of items a message will appear in
your log windows saying how much the transaction fee is. When selling items the
Auction House charges a fee for the transaction. It is usually a small fee of a
couple of gil. If you travel to foreign Auction Houses though, they will jack
you for the cost of the fee and usually charge you 100 gil. Also, if you are
selling a stacked item the fee will be 5 times the regular fee. So, if your fee
is 10 gil for one item you will be charged 50 gil for a stack of 12. So, take
those into consideration when deciding where you want to sell your items and if
you want to sell a stack or as individuals.

Anyway, after the fee message appears select the item again and another range
bar will appear. Now for the price I would enter the median of the highest and 
lowest price from the history list. For example, if you’re selling copper ore 
and the highest price is 100 gil and the lowest is 50 gil, I recommend selling 
it for 75 gil. You can sell it for higher if you like, but I wouldn't sell it 
for any higher then highest price on the history list. Take note though that 
even if you sell it for 75 gil you might be able to make more money on it. It 
depends on how much the bidder bids when it comes up to your item. So, if you 
sold the copper ore for 75 gil and it's next on the sales list and someone bids
100 gil on the copper ore you might make the 100 gil instead of just the 75 gil.
See Selling Tip # 2 below for more information.

Once you select your price a message will come up in your log window and it will
say that if your item does not sell within 9 weeks of Vana'diel time it will be
returned to your delivery box at your Mog House. 9 weeks in Vana'diel time is 
approximately 3 days real world time. That is the only downfall of selling items
on the Auction House, it takes time. If you have priced the item right it 
shouldn't take to long to sell. Take note that you can only be selling 7 items 
at a time. If you want to take off items and to see if your items have sold 
continue on below to Sales Status.

Also, if you are to travel to foreign cities the price history for items will 
differ, sometimes greatly. The same goes for buying. Items in Jeuno may sell for
more money then at your home city, but take in account that if you go to that 
foreign city you will get charged a higher fee, so it may not be worth your 
while. If you don't like traveling to other cities you can use the method
stated above. You can get your friend to buy something for you or in this case
you can send them your item and ask them to sell it at their city. So, if you
live in Bastok and your friend is in Jeuno you can deliver a Leather Vest to
your friend and ask them to put it on Auction for you at their Auction House. 
Your friend would then send you the money when the item sold. Of course though 
this requires a trusting friend. By using this method you can get the most for
your items without traveling and you bypass the higher fees.


Selling Tip # 1 - 

(Thanks to Johny Lau for bringing this tip to my attention.)

Let's say you were selling an Onion Sword for example. If you were to go to bid
and find the Onion Sword you would see how many of them are already on sale. For
this example, let's say that there were already 6 on sale. Before selling select
the sales history of the Onion Sword and you will see the most recent sales.
of this item. You will also notice the date of the transaction and the amount it
sold for. The date would be written like 03/12/07, where 03 is the year, 12 
being the month and 7 being the day. Now write those down and sell your item 
using the steps above. Let's say you were away for two days and you came back 
and your item was still on the sales status. You would then check the sales 
status on the item you are selling to see if the price has changed at all. You 
might notice though that for the Onion Sword there have been transactions
after you posted your item. So you are sitting there wondering why some one
else’s Onion Sword sold before yours did even though they sold theirs later then
you did. Johny Lau had this questioned answered by a Game Master. Apparently 
the items for sale in the sales status are arranged by the prices they were sold
at and not by the date of the transaction. 

So, to explain it a bit easier, let's have one more example. You sold your sword
for 150 gil, because most were sold at that price. Now let's say you have a
friend who sold the same sword at a later time, but for lesser gil. We'll say 
you sold your sword on 12/06/03 for 150 gil and your friend sold his sword on 
12/07/03 for 125 gil. You log in again on 12/08/03 and you go to see if your 
sword hold sold. You find out that it has not sold yet and you decided to wait
a little longer. A little while later you check again, and still no. You are 
about to change the price, when your friend messages you. He tells you that
he just sold his Onion sword that he put on sale the day before. You get angry
with him and ask him why his sword sold before yours did even though you placed
yours on sale before he did. Well, the question to that answer is a small 
fraction of 25 gil. Because your friend sold his sword for 25 gil cheaper, 
he sold his faster then you did, even though he put it on sale later. 

So, in reality it's not when you sell it sometimes, it's how much you sell it 
for. I told you above to sell it for the most common price, which you can still
do and most likely get it sold. But, if you'd rather loose a few gil to get your
item sold quicker then I would recommend selling the item for a small fraction 
cheaper then the lowest price on the history. 

I hope you were able to understand this as it was difficult for me to figure 
out for a little while. If you have any questions on this please feel free to 
e-mail me at abertino@nc.rr.com

Once again thanks to Johny Lau for this information.


Selling Tip # 2 -

(Thanks to Thespian102 for bringing this tip to my attention.)

This tip is similar to the first tip. I'll use an example to explain this in 
greater detail. Let's say you wanted to sell one fire crystal. You would go 
through the usual steps on selling (above if needed) and you would determine the
price of the fire crystal using the sales history. Let's say the last fire 
crystal was sold for 200 gil. Normally you would go to sell and select that fire
crystal and sell it for 200 gil. In Tip # 1 you would sell it for a bit less and
probably get it sold a little quicker. In this case for this fire crystal, sell
it for 1 gil, yes one gil you heard me right. This will insure your item will be
first on the sales list as not many will put their crystal up for sale of 1 gil.
But why 1 gil? At the Auction House when someone bids on something they usually 
bid around the average price from the sales history. In this case a person 
seeking a fire crystal would probably bid around 200 gil. Now, if you sold your 
fire crystal for 1 gil and a person comes around to buy a fire crystal they
would probably enter 200 gil. Since you sold yours at a low price of 1 gil it 
probably will be the first on the sales list. So, when that person bids the 200 
gil for that crystal even though you sold yours for 1 gil you will sell that 
crystal for 200 gil. Just because you put an asking price of 1 gil doesn't mean 
you will get just one gil. All that matters when selling is what the bidder 
bids. So if you sell something for 1 gil and the person behind you bids for that
same item and bids 4000 gil, you will probably make the 4000 gil. The same 
applies for higher prices as well. If you sell that crystal for the original
200 gil and when its turn on the sales list comes up and someone bids 300 gil
you will get 300 gil. There is a down side to this though. If you sell your item
for 1 gil and someone comes up and bids 1 gil for your item you will only make a
whopping one gil. Let's go back to the fire crystal. You sold the crystal for 1
gil. Another player wants a fire crystal and goes through the buying process but
instead of entering 100 gil they accidentally enter 10 gil. Since you sold your
crystal at 1 gil to make it first on the list yours will be the first selling.
Since it’s on the sales list as 1 gil and the first bid on your item was 10 gil
you will only receive 10 gil. That is the only downside to this tip. This 
probably won't happen too often. Most of the time you would probably make good
money this way and really quick as well. So, there is a risk to take when 
selling it for a price of 1 gil.

Also, this could be used to your advantage when buying. Don't always try buying
for just the average price. Start out really low and work your way up. That way
you might be able to buy and expensive item for cheap, because someone tried 
using the same ideas from tip # 1 and 2. Hopefully this tip wasn't too hard to 
understand. If you have any questions feel free to e-mail me using the address 
above. 

Thanks again to Thespian102 for this insightful tip.


Sales Status - 

Check here to see what items you are selling and to see if your items have 
sold. If your item has sold it will be highlighted in a sand color, if not it, 
should be green. If your item hasn't sold in 9 weeks of Vana'diel time or 3 
days real time, it will appear in red and your item will be returned to your 
Mog House (Thanks to The FFXI FAQ Writer, who brought this to my attention via 
e-mail). If you select a sold item, a message will appear in your log window 
saying that your item was sold. If your item was sold. go immediately to you’re
Mog House, because you have money waiting for you. If your item is green you 
can select it to bring up Price History and Stop Sale. If your item is not 
selling fast enough for you, check the price history and make sure the prices 
haven't adjusted since you first sold your item. This may account for you item 
not selling. If you’re tired of an item not selling or you put the item up for 
sale by accident, select the item and choose Stop Sale and the item will return
to your inventory. Remember that you can only have 7 items on your sales status
list, so make sure you remove all sold items so you can make room for more. 

If you are curious, I found something interesting when I talked to an NPC next
to an Auction House. That NPC told me that the IAHC or the International Auction
House Commitee determines how many items you can sell at a time, 7. I'm sure 
it's just some thing they put in there to make the game seem more real to life, 
but you never know, it might mean at one point they could raise the number to 
something higher. So, I'l keep my eyes open for that just in case they decide
to allow more sellings on any of the future updates.


Advice - 

If you need advice right away and don't want to read this (even though 
you are right now) you can ask any NPC near the Auction House. Each Auction 
House with counters should have an NPC around to assist you. I'm not sure how
worthy there answers will be, but it doesn't hurt to ask. 

Also if you ever needed to send something to someone, an item or gil, you can
talk to the NPCs around the Auction House and one of them should be able to
assist you in sending that person the item or the gil. To do this make sure your
know the persons in game name as that is the only way to get that item to that 
person.

That's pretty much it for how to use and understand the Auction House. If you
still have any questions feel free to e-mail me at abertino@nc.rr.com

V.   Auction House Item List                              |
----------------------------------------------------------

Before looking at the Item list below take note of the following:

The item list below is for the Auction Houses on my server/world of Carbuncle. I
have finished the whole list which now consists of all 4 major cities, but the 
list will still be differenrt from city to city as some items are in one city
and not in others. If you live in another world the entire list below may vary
as well, as your cities are entirely different. If you want the most complete
list I would recommend heading over to Jeuno as its Auction House is quite far 
the biggest of any of the cities. If you have any questions you can email me by
using the address above. 

After saying that here is the list. The list is in order by how the Auction 
House has it organized, Weapons, Armors, Scrolls, and etc. Under each 
individual category the items will be placed in the order that they are given
to me. The items might be in a different order for you, but the item should 
still be in the right category. 

To avoid any confusion, the Item Quantity means how many of that item there is, 
but not for sale. To tell how many of the item there is look right next to the 
item. If there is a pink 12 then it is a quantity of 12. If there is no pink 12 
then it can only be a quantity of 1 or 99. There should only be three Item 
quantities, 1, 12 or 99, because the Auction House doesn't allow you to sell 
any items that aren't individual or stacked into 12 and 99. So, if you have 6 
Flint Stones, you cannot sell those 6 Flint Stones on the Auction House. You 
would have to collect 6 more and sell them as a stack of 12 or split them into 
individual stones. Some items cannot be sold in a stack of 99. Arrows, shurikens
and bullets are usually the only items that can sell as a stack of 99. 


----- Changed as of 12/15/03 -----

An update was launched for Final Fantasy XI PC on 12/15/03 and within the 
update they reorganized the Auction House category list. They added a Food and
a Crystal Category, which previously were apart of the Other category. The 
Food category consists of now three new sub-categories of Meals, Ingredients,
and Fish. Meals are broken down to even more sub-categories, which you can see 
below. The Crystal category has no sub-category and just has crystals. The
Other category has dropped Food from it's sub-category list and added 
Beast-Made, Cards, Ninja Tools and Cursed Items to the already Miscellaneous 
sub-category. Hopefully I haven't confused you to death, as I know this took a 
while for me to grasp. 

Also, there might be items in the wrong sections because Square-Enix did 
everything they could to screw me up, as they moved items all over the place for
this new update. I tried the best I could to adjust to the changes, so hopefully
I did. If you have any questions or want to notify me that an item is in a wrong
section feel free to email me at abertino@nc.rr.com

---------------------------------

If you are in quick need of finding an item, hit control + F on your keyboard 
and type in the item you are looking for and select Find Next. This should make 
it easier and quicker for you to determine where the item is on the list below.

On a side note this game has the largest database of Items I have ever seen in 
my 13 years of gaming. It took me a while to finish the list below, so I hope 
you enjoy it!

I would first like to thank Square-Enix for creating such a wonderful game to
keep me endlessly busy. I would also like to thank them for making the PC 
instruction manual as I found many useful tips in that manual. 

I would of course like to thank GameFAQs, IGN, Neoseeker, DLH, Vanadielonline, 
and pavlovian.net for allowing me to post my FAQ on their sites. They are all 
great websites that deserve a lot of credit for their hard work. 

I would like to thank bpfinsa for giving me information on how the Auction 
Houses work between cities. I would also like to thank The FFXI FAQ Writer for 
e-mailing me reminding me to add a part to the Sales Status section of the FAQ.
More thanks to omlette for telling me about a typo in the Copyright Information
Section.   

I would like to thank Johny Lau for sending me an e-mail telling me about an 
interesting tip on selling. You can view this tip at the Understanding the 
Auction House section, under the Selling portion. 

Some more thanks to Thespian102 for also sending me an e-mail with a new tip. 
You can also view this tip at the Understanding the Auction House section, under
the Selling portion. 

I can't forget to thank the several people from the boards. I wish I can 
remember your names to give you credit, but I couldn't find the posts. I thank 
you for you information. 

Of course, I can't forget to thank my agent, family, the little people, my 
stunt double, my hairdresser, my producer, director, co-stars, and all those
other people. Just kidding, I guess I would like to thank my parents though for
making me.

I'm forgetting someone I know it. Oh who is it? Come on think. Think. Oh! Of 
course! I forgot to thank you all for readinh this FAQ. 

I hope this FAQ was helpful in some way shape or form. If you have any comments,
complaints, or concerns feel free to email me at abertino@nc.rr.com 

Once again, thanks to everyone mentioned above!
