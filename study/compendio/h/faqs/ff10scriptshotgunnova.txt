NOTATION EXPLANATIONS:

T-Narrative            Tidus' narrative. Separated from regular type
                       because it's said in flashback (i.e. not fixed
                       to events in game, really)

                       given instance but more people can say a piece
                       there as well, under different circumstances.

*Dialogue single-spaced in the regular script is almost always an
 example of speaking in unison. In NPC script, it stands for that
 as well as conversations.

[Around a campfire, a group of people sits in silence. A blonde man
gets up and walks to a hill, gazing at the overlying, watery
region.]

T-Narrative: Listen to my story. This may be our last chance.

[The game title flashes on the fade-to-black screen. Soon, a city of
futuristic origins appears. People gather by a houseboat, waiting for
someone to come out. The man who spoke earlier steps off much to their
delight. He runs to the crowd, and starts to speak with them.]

Woman: "I've been a big fan of yours. From the very beginning!"
Main Character: "I won't let you down!"
Woman: "Th-Thanks!"

Male Fan: "Hey, how are you feeling?"
Main Character: "Great as ever! Thanks!"
Male Fan: "Yeah! We're cheering for you!"

Man: "Good luck!"

Woman: "Are you gonna show us that show tonight?"
Main Character: "Uh...I dunno. Maybe."
Woman: "You should do it! For us."

Woman: "Can I have your autograph?"
Main Character: "Of course!" [Default name: Tidus]
Woman 2: "Good luck tonight!"
Tidus: "Nothing to worry about. Oh, if I score a goal... I'll do this!"
  [He makes a signal with his hands.]
Tidus: "That will mean it was for you, okay? What seat?"
Woman 2: "East block, in the front row! Fifth from the right!"
Tidus: "Got it!"

Kid 1: "Can you sign this?"
Tidus: "No prob!"
Kid 2: "Please?"
Tidus: "Alrighty."
Kid 3: "Me, too!"
Tidus: "Take it easy."

[After talking to the fans, Tidus gets ready to leave.]

Tidus: "Well, gotta go! Cheer for me!"

Kid 1: "...two, three!"

Kid 1: "Teach us how to blitz!"
Kid 2: "Teach us how to blitz!"
Kid 3: "Teach us how to blitz!"

Tidus: "Hey, I got a game to play!"

Kid 1: "Then teach us after!"

Tidus: "Maybe tonight...um...well..."

Strange Boy: "You can't tonight."

Tidus: "I mean...tomorrow."

Kid 1: "Promise?"

Tidus: "Promise!"

[Later on, Tidus walks to the game on an empty street. He sees a
large banner of a man in a red headband and crossed arms on the side
of a building. Tidus harrumphs and runs down the street.]

Narrative: I was in a coffee shop, running away from home when I heard
           the news. Our hero, Jecht, gone. Vanished into thin air! My
           dad must have been his biggest fan. I knew how sad he'd be.
           Heck, we all were that day. 'Zanar,' I says to myself.
           'What are you thinking?' I went running straight back home.
           We sat up talking 'bout Jecht all night. My dad and I never
           talked so much. Whoa... Didn't mean to reminisce, folks.
           Anyway... Ten years later, the Jecht Memorial Cup
           tournament is today! The two teams that have won through to
           the finals are...of course, the Abes from A-East, and the
           Duggles from C-South. I know there's a lot of people out
           there today to see the star of the Abes! In just one year,
           he's become the team's number one player! He's Jecht's
           blood, and the new hope for blitzball! What kind of super
           play will he show us today? Will we see his father's
           legendary shot? I don't think I'm the only one excited
           here, folks!

[As Tidus arrives at the stadium, a mob of people swamps him.]

Tidus: "Make way, make way! Coming through, sorry! Hey, I'm gonna
       be late! Hey, let go of me!"

[Tidus heads in. FMV. The roof of the stadium retracts and the game
starts to start up. The crowd roars for Tidus. Somewhere in the city,
a man in a red garb raises a toast to a gigantic creature coming out
of the water. Meanwhile, the game has started and Tidus is easily
outmatching everyone. The gigantic thing coming out of the ocean now
starts to rise out... Tidus finds the ball and gets ready to score a
goal, but the creature coming out of the water shoots missiles and the
town starts to get demolished. Tidus comes to in a bit and recognizes
the man in red from before, who's now made his way to the stadium's
front.]

Tidus: "Auron! What are you doing here?"

Auron: "I was waiting for you."

Tidus: "What are you talking about?"

[Tidus follows him to a highway and, for a moment, he spots the
strange kid from before who 'stops time'.]

Strange Boy: "It begins. Don't cry."

[Time starts up again and the street goes chaotic again.]

Tidus: "What the...? Hey! Wait!"

[Tidus spots Auron.]

Tidus: "Hey, not this way!"

Auron: "Look!"

[FMV. The creature from the ocean is floating out of the water in
a large sphere of water. It's gigantic.]

Auron: "We called it 'Sin.'"

Tidus: "'Sin'?"

[A building facade explodes as a monster tentacle rips out of it. It
shoots tiny scales onto the highway, which turn into mobile monsters.
Tidus tries to fend them off with his hands, but to no effect. Auron
hands him a sword.]

Auron: "Take it. A gift from Jecht."

Tidus: "My old man?"

[Auron now has his large sword slung on his shoulder.]

Auron: "I hope you know how to use it."

[The battle starts.]

Auron: "These ones don't matter! We cut through!"

[They start making progress down the highway.]

Auron: "Don't bother going after all of them. Cut the ones that
       matter, and run!"

[They blaze through, swords cutting down the enemies. Over the top
of a hill, a large tentacle-like monster is embedded into the ground.
The battle starts.]

Tidus: "Get out of my town!"

Auron: "Some can't wait to die!"

Narrative: [Overdrives]

           When a character's overdrive gauge beneath the HP/MP
           display is full, that character may use a special unique
           attack one time. Press (D-left) in the command window to
           use an overdrive.

[Auron uses his 'Dragon Fang' overdrive and kills the little enemies
that appeared with the boss. They cut down the boss as well, and head
on. Tidus stops at a glowing blue ball.]

Narrative: [Traveler's Save Sphere Level 1]

           Stores a record of your travels. Also fully restores your
           party's HP and MP.

[Tidus follows Auron past the electronic banner of Jecht, which is
flickering in the destruction. Tidus looks at his father's picture.]

Tidus: "What are you laughing at, old man? Auron! Let's get out of
       here!"

Auron: "We're expected."

Tidus: "Huh? Gimme a break, man!"

[The two eventually get trapped between two leagues of enemies.
Auron directs Tidus' attention to some large cannisters leaning on
the edge of the overpass.]

Auron: "Hmph. This could be bad. That--knock it down!"

Tidus: "What?"

Auron: "Trust me. You'll see."

[The oil tanker falls and explodes, taking out part of the highway.]

Auron: "Go!"

[The two run along the collapsing highway. Auron makes it to the
other side; Tidus hangs on the ledge, just barely. FMV. The large
creature in the water hovers overhead, sucking in debris and pieces
of the highway, which levitates up towards it.]

Tidus: "Auron! Auron!"

[Auron looks at the monster.]

Auron: "You are sure?"

[He turns back to Tidus.]

Auron: "This is it. This is your story. It all begins here."

[A flash of light and suddenly Tidus is underwater, hearing Jecht's
voice.]

Jecht: "Hey! Hey!"

Tidus: "My...old man?"

[Tidus swims down to the stadium, where he thinks he sees Jecht. When
he gets there, a younger version of himself is there.]

T-Narrative: I thought about a lot of things...like where I was, what
             I'd got myself into. I started to feel light-headed...and
             then, sleepy. I think I had a dream. A dream of being
             alone. I wanted someone -- anyone, beside me...so I
             didn't have to feel alone anymore.

| 02) Baaj Temple                                               BJTM |
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

[Tidus wakes up on a small 'debris island' near the exterior of an
old temple that's fallen into ruins...or rather, pieces...it's mostly
broken up.]

Tidus: "Anybody there? Auron! Heeey!"

[Tidus enters the temple's middle section, but the walkway caves in
and he tumbles into the water. Soon, he's attacked by three Sahagins.
He kills two, but the third is eaten by a giant fish. Tidus attempts
to kill the gigantic fish, but is forced to flee.]

Tidus: "Whoa!"

[He makes it into an underwater corridor before the boss sucks him in
for lunch. The exit then promptly caves in.

T-Narrative: I had made it out of the frying pan...and into the
             freezer. I thought I was going to die in this place.

[After venturing inside, Tidus finds a mostly intact room with a
bunch of hideous statues. Since it's open-roofed and there is falling
water everywhere, the place is cold enough to make breath visible.]

Tidus: "Cold... Need...fire."

[A search turns up a Withered Bouquet and a piece of Flint. He starts
a fire, finally.]

Tidus: "I need food!"

[He has a flashback to his houseboat. Auron's just entered.]

Tidus: "What do you want?"

Auron: "It was a bad call. Your team lost because of you."

Tidus: "You came to say THAT?"

Auron: "It's been...ten years. I thought you'd be crying."

Tidus: "Who, me?"

[The strange boy from before appears, surrounded by swirling lights.]

Strange Boy: "You cried."

[The flashback ends. Tidus is falling asleep by the fire, and it's
almost out. Something looks at Tidus' position from above.]

Tidus: "Hey, wait! Wait! Don't go out on me! Just hold on. I'll get
       more wood!"

[He sees a monster looking at him. It runs along the wall before
jumping down to him, engaging him in battle. Just then, a door blows
off on one side of the room and some strange people step out with
weapons. A girl steps forward and they start to fight the boss while
the armed men watch.]

Tidus: "You on my side? Cool!"

Narrative: [Using Grenades]

           Certain items, like grenades, have special effects when
           used. These items can only be used during battle by
           selecting the Special ability Use.

[Together, the two kill the boss.]

Tidus: "Whew! That was close."

[The armed men step forward. One grabs Tidus by his hair.]

Tidus: "Hey, lemme go!"

Man 1: "Fryd ec drec?" ["What is this?"]

Man 2: "Y fiend! Eh risyh teckieca!" ["A fiend! In human disguise!"]

Man 3: "Oac! Ed ec cu!" ["Yes! It is so!"]

Man 4: "Fa gemm ed?" ["We kill it?"]

Girl: "Fyed! Fryd ev ed ec risyh?" ["Wait! What if it is human?"]

Man 4: "Drao yna dra cysa eh taydr." ["They are the same in death."]

Girl: "E vunpet ed! Fa pnehk ed fedr ic." ["I forbid it! We bring it
      with us."]

[She goes up to Tidus closely--]

Girl: "Cunno." ["Sorry."]

[--and knocks the wind out of him. His last sights are of the men
standing over him, as the girl leaves.]

| 03) Al Bhed Ship                                              ABSH |
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

[A ship out in the ocean has its search-light beacons scanning the
water. Tidus wakes up on the deck, only to see two armed guards turn
towards him.]

Man: "Ced, lybdeja!" ["Sit, captive!"]

[He slams the butt of the weapon into Tidus.]

Tidus: "Hey, that hurts!"

Man 2: "Hu sujehk, rayn?" ["No moving, hear?"]

Tidus: "Whoa... Okay."

[A man and the girl from before walk out.]

Man 3: "Caynir res!" ["Search him!"]

Tidus: "Right. Whatever."

Man 3: "Tu oui hud cbayg?" ["Do you not speak?"]

Tidus: "I said I don't understand!"

Man: "Ehcumahla!" ["Insolence!"]

Girl: "Fyed!" ["Stop!"] "He said you can stay if you make yourself useful."

Tidus: "You... You understand me? All right, I'll work!"

[When Tidus can move freely, he talks to the girl again.]

Girl: "Oh, almost forgot!

Narrative: [Using the Sphere Grid]

           The Sphere Grid is used to develop your characters by activating
           nodes with spheres. Let's see how this is done. Select Sphere Grid
           from the Main Menu. The cursor appears at the selected character's
           current position. Use (D-pad) to move the cursor. Information on
           upgrades is displayed at top. This location is for Defense
           upgrades...and this one lets you learn an Ability. These upgrade
           locations are called nodes. Activate these nodes to upgrade your
           characters. A character must be on or adjacent to a node in order
           to activate it. Let's go through this step-by-step. If you press
           (X)...the cursor returns to the character's position, and a list
           of commands appears. If you select Move...the number of steps the
           character can move is displayed. The number of steps a character can
           move is equivalent to his Sphere Level (S. LVL). Sphere Levels are
           gained by getting Ability Points (AP), which are obtained by
           participating in battles. A character must fight battles to gain AP
           and raise Sphere Levels in order to move around the Grid. In short,
           if the character does not participate in battles, he will not grow
           stronger. In this case, Tidus has 4 Sphere Levels, so he can move 4
           steps. In general, you should be careful not to rush or you may
           forget to activate nodes. So, let's take one step...and learn the
           ability Cheer. Note that you only have to be next to a node in order
           to activate it. Once you select a destination...you automatically
           spend the required number of Sphere Levels, and the character
           moves. When the character arrives at the designated spot...you will
           be asked to confirm the move. Confirm by selecting "Yes." At this
           point, the movement process is complete and cannot be cancelled. If
           you want to activate the nodes you passed over, you must spend
           Sphere Levels to go back. When you're retracing your steps, you can
           move 4 steps by spending 1 Sphere Level. However, backtracking every
           time is not very cost-efficient, so plan ahead to avoid wasting
           Sphere Levels. Okay! Now that the character is in place, let's
           activate a node. To activate nodes, you must use spheres. Spheres
           can be obtained by various means, such as by defeating enemies.
           Press (X). Now, select Use. A list of spheres currently in stock is
           displayed. Every sphere has a special function. For example, Power
           Spheres are used to activate Strength, Defense, and HP nodes.
           Ability Spheres activate Ability nodes. Nodes that can be activated
           are the node at the character's current position and nodes one step
           away. This means nodes immediately ahead of or behind the current
           position can also be activated. In this example, the only node that
           can be activated is an Ability node, so you need to use an Ability
           Sphere. When you select a sphere...the nodes that sphere can
           activate at the current position are highlighted. Selecting an
           Ability Sphere highlights the one adjacent Ability node. When you
           select the node you wish to activate...the node will light up and
           the character will learn its ability. Note that one Ability Sphere
           was used during this process. Use the same procedure to improve the
           characters' Strength, Magic, max HP & MP. Power Spheres, Magic
           Spheres, and Speed Spheres are needed to improve each corresponding
           attribute. Also, ever node on the Grid can be activated separately
           by each character. This means that a character can re-activate a
           node already used by another character by moving to it and using the
           corresponding sphere. Note that Locks cannot be opened at present.
           Another tutorial will become available once you are able to open
           them. Now that you know how to upgrade your characters, let's look
           at the other useful features of the Sphere Grid. The character's
           current status can be displayed by pressing (/\). Use this
           information to plan how you wish to upgrade your characters. Press
           [L1] and [R1]...to switch between characters. This is useful when
           you wish to compare the characters' stats or when you wish to
           quickly upgrade multiple characters. Press [SELECT] to zoom in and
           out for a better view of the Grid. This concludes the Sphere Grid
           tutorial. Try improving Tidus now.

Girl: "We found some ancient ruins right beneath us. It's not active
      now, but there should still be some power left. We're gonna go
      down there and activate it...and then we should be able to
      salvage the big prize! Okay! Let's get to work!"

Tidus: "Roger!"

[Tidus dives into the water with the girl, and they follow the anchor
line down to the ruins. They locate a power source inside and turn it
on. As they head back, they encounter an octopus boss. It moves out of
attack range in the middle of battle.]

Narrative: [Trigger Commands]

           Special commands become available in certain battles. Press
           (D-left) in the command window to access them.

[The two defeat the boss and exit the ruins. Outside, lights from the
structure start to function, showing what appears to be a sunken air-
-ship... Back onboard...]

Man: "Fa vuiht dra airship!" ["We found the airship!"]

Man 2: "Dra naluntc fana nekrd." ["The records were right."]

Man 3: "Huf, ruf du tnyk ed ib?" ["Now, how to drag it up?"]

[Tidus starts to enter the ship, but gets stiff-armed.]

Man: "Oui, uidceta!" ["You, outside!"]

Tidus: "Hey, I helped out, didn't I?"

[The door slams shut. Later on, Tidus is reclining by some crates.]

Tidus: "Uhh...hungry."

[Just then, the girl appears, bearing food.]

Tidus: "Whoa! Right on!

[Tidus scarfs the food down and starts to choke. He takes a canteen
from the girl and unclogs his pipes.]

Girl: "It's 'cause you eat too fast!"

[He gets up.]

Girl: "Hey!"

Tidus: "Hello there. What is your name?"

Girl: "Rikku."

Tidus: "Whoa! You really do understand! Why didn't you say so earlier?"

Rikku: "I didn't get a chance to! Everyone thought oui were a fiend."

Tidus: "Uh...'we'?"

Rikku: "Oh, 'oui' means 'you.'"

Tidus: "Who are you guys, anyway?"

Rikku: "We're Al Bhed. Can't you tell? Wait. You're not an Al Bhed-
       -hater, are you?"

Tidus: "I don't even know what an Al Bhed is."

Rikku: "Where are you from?"

Tidus: "Zanarkand. I'm a blitzball player. Star player of the
       Zanarkand Abes!"

Rikku: "Did you hit your head or something?"

Tidus: "Um, you guys hit me."

Rikku: "Oh, right... Do you remember anything before that?"

T-Narrative: So I told her everything there was to tell about
             Zanarkand... About life there, blitzball, and Sin's
             attack...and about how Auron and I were engulfed in this
             light. I just said things as they came to mind. But then
             I started to wonder.

Tidus: "Did I say something funny?"

Rikku: "You were near Sin. Don't worry, you'll be better in no time.
       They say your head gets funny when Sin is near. Maybe you just
       had some kind of dream?"

Tidus: "You mean I'm sick?"

Rikku: "Because of Sin's toxin, yeah."

Tidus: "You sure?"

Rikku: "Yeah, there is no Zanarkand anymore. Sin destroyed it a
       thousand years ago. So...no one plays blitzball there."

Tidus: "What do you mean, a thousand years ago? But I saw Sin attack
       Zanarkand! You're saying that happened a thousand years ago? No
       way!"

Rikku: "You said... You play blitzball? You know, you should go to
       Luca. Someone might know who you are, or you might find someone
       you recognize."

Tidus: "Luca?"

Rikku: "Okay, leave it to me! I'll get you to Luca, promise! You'd
       rather stay here? Okay. I'll go tell the others. Wait here. Oh,
       and one thing. Don't tell anyone you're from Zanarkand, okay?
       Yevon says it's a holy place. You might upset someone."

T-Narrative: My Zanarkand, some kind of holy place? Yeah right, I
             thought. Since when? Yevon? Sin? Luca? I thought Sin had
             just taken me to some faraway place, that I could go
             back in a day or two. But a thousand years into the
             future? No way!

[Tidus kicks a crate and the ship rumbles. He rolls across the deck
into a railing. A large monster in the water shoots a geyser up, and
the the men file out of the door.]

Man: "Sin!"

Man 2: "Sin ec lusa!"

Man 3: "Ihtan ic! Ihtan ic!"

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

[Tidus wakes up in some shallow water.]

Tidus: "Rikku!"

[A blitzball hits him in the head.]

Tidus: "Blitzball!"

[A man on shore yells to him.]

Man: "Hey! You okay?"

Tidus: "Heeey!"

[Tidus does a special move and kicks the ball out of sight.]

Man: "Whoa-ho!"

[Tidus swims to the beach.]

Tidus: "Yo! Hiya!"

Man: "You wanna try that move one more time?

T-Narrative: Finally, things were starting to look up.

[Tidus does the kick again, this time from on land.]

Man: "You're not amateur. Who you play for?"

Tidus: "The Zanarkand Abes!"

Man: "What team you say again?"

Tidus: "Uh, I meant... Forget that. I got too, uh...close to Sin and
       my head's all foggy-like. So I don't know where this place is.
       Or even where I came from."

Man: "Sin's toxin got to you. But, you're still alive. Praise be to
     Yevon! All right, back to practice!"

[The rest of the men start practicing again.]

Wakka: "I'm Wakka, coach and captain of the Besaid Aurochs, brudda.
       What? You hungry? Okay! Back to the village. I'll get you
       somethin'!"

T-Narrative: I felt like I could trust this Wakka, so I just had to
             ask.

Tidus: "It's true Zanarkand was destroyed, right? A thousand years
       ago? So it's just a big pile of rubble now, isn't it?"

Wakka: "Long time ago, there were a whole lot of cities in Spira. Big
       cities with machina--machines--to run 'em. People played all
       day and let the machine do the work. And then, well, take a
       look. Sin came, and destroyed the machina cities. And Zanarkand
       along with 'em. Yeah, that was about a thousand years ago, just
       like you said. If you ask me, Sin's our punishment for letting
       things get out of hand. What gets me, though...is we gotta
       suffer, 'cause of what some goofballs did way back when!
       'Course, we must always repent for our sins! That's important!
       It's just that, it's hard to keep at it sometimes, you know?"

T-Narrative: It was just as Rikku had said. Wakka and Rikku couldn't
             both be lying. Why would they?

Wakka: "But you from the Zanarkand Abes -- that was a good one! Hey,
       I'm not saying the team never existed, ya? But you gotta figure
       a team livin' in luxury like that'd be pretty soft, eh?"

T-Narrative: I appreciated the fact that Wakka was trying to cheer me
             up. But at that time, all I could think about was...
             everything that happened to me -- all of this -- started
             with Sin. Maybe if I could find Sin one more time, I
             could go home! For now, I'd just live life until that
             time came. No more worrying about where, or when, I was.
             Sure it was hard not to think of home. But I started to
             feel better already. A little better...maybe.

[Tidus follows Wakka.]

Wakka: "Hey! It's this way!

[They come to a cliff.]

Tidus: "Huh?"

[Wakka pushes him in and then dives in after.]

Tidus: "What's the big idea?"

[Wakka comes up from behind Tidus and gets him in a headlock.]

Tidus: "Lemme go!"

Wakka: "Got a favor to ask ya."

Tidus: "You want me on your team, right?"

Wakka: "A major blitz tournament's coming up. All the teams in
       Spira'll be there! It's so huge, I'm sure someone there will
       recognize you! Then you can go back to your old team, right?
       It'll be fun! What do you say, huh? Come on, come on!

Tidus: "Sure thing."

Wakka: "Dude! Our team is gonna rock, eh?"

T-Narrative: I thought then that blitzball and Sin were the only two
             things that Spira and Zanarkand had in common. I wasn't
             too far off, either.

[The two come to a cliff above a village.]

Wakka: "This is where I was born. I started blitz when I was five. I
       joined the Aurochas at thirteen...ten years ago. Ten years...
       and we never won a game. Well, after last year's tournament, I
       quit. Time seemed right. So, after quitting, I got this new
       job, ya? But every time my mind wandered, I thought about the
       game."

Tidus: "Ten years without a single win'll do that."

Wakka: "My first match last year was my big chance. But something
       else was on my mind. I couldn't focus."

Tidus: "Nice excuse."

Wakka: "Hey, hey!"

Tidus: "So you want to win the next tournament -- go out with a bang.
       So, what's our goal?"

Wakka: "I don't care how we do. Long as we play our best. If we give
       it our all, I can walk away happy."

Tidus: "No, no, no, no, no. If I say, 'What's our goal?' you say,
       'Victory!' When you play in a blitzball tournament, you play
       to win!"

Wakka: "Victory? You serious?"

[They start walking to the village when a red-haired man calls them.
A shorter man is with him.]

Red-haired Man: "Ah, the one from the sea!"

Short Man: "Be on guard. There're fiends on the road today!"

Red-haired Man: "After surviving your run-in with Sin, 'twould be a
                shame if something happened now.

[The men leave.]

Tidus: "Who were they?"

Wakka: "Luzzu and Gatta -- Crusaders."

Tidus: "Crews of what?"

Wakka: "What, you forgot that, too? Hey, sorry. Don't worry about it.
       I'll help you out."

Tidus: "Cool. In return, come tournament time, I'll make sure we take
       the cup!"

Wakka: "Cool. About the Crusaders, you can ask the yourself. They've
       got a lodge in the village."

[The two walk through the town gates.]

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Wakka: "Besaid Village."

Tidus: "They got any food there?"

Wakka: "We'll get you something over there later. Take a look around
       first. Let's see... The Crusaders lodge is over yonder. Luzzu
       and Gatta are usually there. Oh, right. Over here!"

Tidus: "Huh? What's up?"

Wakka: "You do remember the prayer, right?"
       R1 --> I don't remember.
       R2 --> I don't know any prayers.

       R1 (T-Narrative): I didn't know it in the first place, to tell
                         the truth.

          Wakka: Man, that's like the basics of the basics. Alright,
                 I'll show you."

       R2 (T-Narrative): Of course I'd never prayed before in my life.
                         Not that he would know that...

          Wakka: "You must have forgot or something. Here, I'll show you."

[He shows Tidus the prayer.]

Wakka: "Go ahead, you try."

[Tidus pulls it off...sort of.]

Wakka: "Hey, not bad. Okay, now go present yourself to the temple
       summoner."

T-Narrative: Any blitzball player would know that prayer. It was the
             blitzball sign for victory.

[Tidus goes to the temple and sees people praying to statues.]

T-Narrative: It was then, standing in that place. I began to realize
             how different this world was from my own.

[Tidus walks over to a large statue of a man with a staff. A man walks
over to him.]

Monk: "Ten years have passed since Lord Braska became high summoner.
      And finally we receive a statue for our temple."

Tidus: "What's a high summoner?"

[Gasps come from the people in the temple.]

Tidus: "I...I got too close to Sin's, uh, toxin."

T-Narrative: It was funny hearing myself make the same excuse over and
             over. Funny, and a little sad."

Monk: "The summoners are practitioners of a sacred art, sworn to
      protect the people of Yevon. Only a chosen few become summoners,
      who call forth entities of greater power: the aeons. The aeons
      hear our prayers and come down to us. They are the blessing of
      Yevon."

T-Narrative: So what he meant...was that we should respect some kinda
             great men or something like that...I figured.

[Tidus walks back to Wakka's house.]

Wakka: "Sorry, man. No time for lunch yet. Take a nap! You look
       bushed." [Thanks/No, I'm fine.]

[Tidus takes a nap. While he's sleeping, a monk walks into the house.]

Monk: "You could at least go see how they're doing."

Wakka: "We can't interfere. It's a rule."

Monk: "But, it's been nearly..."

[The two walk out together. Tidus has a dream, those words cuing up
some memory to play out. He's back at a houseboat, and people have
gathered like usual. This time it doesn't seem like a happy occasion.]

Man: "It's been nearly a day already."

Woman: "Perhaps you could go look for us."

Man: "People are searching for him now.

Woman: "Thank you."

[The man leaves.]

Young Tidus: "Who cares whether he comes back or not?"

Woman: "But he might die!"

Young Tidus: "Fine, let him!"

Woman: "Do you... Do you hate him so? If he dies, you'll never be able
       to tell him how much you hate him."

[Tidus wakes up in Besaid. It's still day out.]

Tidus: "Wakka?"

[Tidus goes to the temple and finds Wakka talking with a monk.]

Tidus: "Is something wrong?"

Wakka: "The summoner hasn't returned from the trial."

Tidus: "Eh?"

Wakka: "Well, apprentice summoner, really..."

Tidus: "Ah?"

Wakka: "There's a room in there called the Cloiser of Trials. Beyond
       is where the apprentice summoner prays. If the prayer is heard,
       the apprentice becomes a fully-fledged summoner, remember?"

Tidus: "So someone is in there somewhere and they haven't come back
       out. Right, I got it."

Wakka: "A day's already gone by."

Tidus: "Is it particularly dangerous in there?"

Wakka: "Sometimes, yes."

Tidus: "Why don't you go in and help?"

Wakka: "There's already guardians in there. Besides, it's forbidden."

[Tidus runs up the steps to the Cloister.]

Tidus: "Hey, but what if somethin' happens? What if the summoner
       dies!?"

Monk: "The precepts must be obeyed!"

Tidus: "Like I care!"

[Tidus runs into the Cloister lickety-split.]

T-Narrative: Maybe this wasn't such a good idea, after all.

Narrative: [The Cloister of Trials]

           Those who seek to learn of Yevon's secret arts are tested
           by the Cloister of Trials. Find the right way, and you will
           be taken to the Chamber of the Fayth. Examine objects with
           (X) to open the way.

[Tidus touches a glyph on the wall.]

Narrative: A strange glyph glows.

[On a different wall:]

Narrative: A glyph glows on the wall. [Touch glyph./Cancel.]

[Tidus touches it and opens up a new path, to a niche in the wall
that has a sphere in it.]

Narrative: You must use a sphere to go any further. Glyph Spheres open
           the way to the Chamber of the Fayth. Destruction Spheres
           open the way to hidden treasure. It seems that Besaid
           Spheres are also necessary.

[Tidus removes the Glyph Sphere.]

Narrative: You can carry only one sphere at a time.

[Tidus comes to a door with a sphere-sized niche in it.]

Narrative: The door seems to be locked by an unseen force. You see a
           sphere-shaped recess. You are holding a Glyph Sphere.
           [Insert sphere./Cancel.]

[Tidus opens the door with the sphere. He touches some glyphs on a
wall and finds a Besaid Sphere.]

Narrative: You found a Besaid Sphere. A Besaid Sphere is set here.
           [Take sphere./Cancel.]

[By a wall, another niche is found.]

Narrative: You see a sphere-shaped recess. You are holding a Besaid
           Sphere. [Insert sphere./Cancel.]

[Tidus puts it in and the wall dissipates, revealing a pedestal.]

Narrative: Move the pedestal set with a sphere to the correct place.
           If you move it improperly, step on the shining glyph to
           return the pedestal to its original place.

[Tidus pushes the pedestal until it sinks into the ground. Wakka
appears.]

Wakka: "Hey! What's gotten into you? Hey, it's okay. Only summoners,
       apprentice summoners, and their guardians can enter here. It's
       a tradition. Very important."

Tidus: "So what about you?"

Wakka: "Me? I'm a guardian."

Tidus: "A guardian?"

[The pedestal triggers an elevator to descend.]

Wakka: "Summoners go on a pilgrimage to pray at every temple in
       Spira. Guardians protect them. The guardians in there now...
       One of them's got a short fuse, and who knows what the other
       is thinking. Well, now that we've come this far...might as well
       go all the way!"

[The two walk into a room. The two guardians -- a cat-person and a
woman in black -- are waiting around on some stairs. At the top is a
door that's closed.]

Woman: "What are you doing here? Didn't think we'd be able to handle
       it?"

Wakka: "No, it's uh...it's just..."

[He elbows Tidus.]

Wakka: "See, I told you she gets mad easily."

[The woman walks over.]

Tidus: "Is the summoner all right?"

Woman: "Who are you?"

[Just then, the door at the top of the stair opens. A woman steps
out, stumbling. She almost falls down the stairs but the cat-person
catches her, running faster than Tidus with ease.]

Woman: "I have done it. I have become a summoner!"

[The party walks back to the temple's entrance.]

T-Narrative: Man, was I surprised. And here I was, thinking summoners
             were all old geezers."

[At the town square, Wakka calls to Tidus.]

Wakka: "Hey, over here!"

[Wakka grabs him as he walks by and drags him closer.]

Tidus: "What? Ow!"

Wakka: "Wait till you see this!"

Tidus: "I can't see anything!"

Wakka: "Ready!"

[The new summoner is there.]

New Summoner: "Okay."

[She summons a gigantic bird-creature, which comes down to her. She
pets its beak

T-Narrative: I had never seena ything like it in my life. Sure, it
             was a little scary, but still... I could feel a strange
             kind of gentleness from it.


[The creature disappears back into the clouds, and the player can
name the aeon (Default: Valefor).]

T-Narrative: I remember... That night, we talked for the first time. I
             didn't know it then, but after that night, everything
             changed. For everyone... For me...

[Nighttime. The Aurochs stand off to themselves near a bonfire.]

Wakka: "Let me introduce you to the team. This guy wants into the
       tournament so bad, I let him on the team. His memory's a little
       fuzzy, so don't mind him if he says anything odd! Come on, say
       hi."

Tidus: "Uh... Hi, guys. So, what's our goal?"

Aurochs: "To do our best!"

Wakka: "Nope, we got a new goal now! Our new goal...is victory! To
       win every match, to defeat every opposing team! To bring the
       Crystal Cup back to our island! That's all we need to do to
       win! Easy, ya?"

Aurochs: "Victory... Victory! Victory! Victory!"

[The team starts chanting 'victory!'. Tidus looks at the summoner. And
walks over to where she sits after awhile. She's surrounded by some
elderly people and a child.]

Old Man: "You heathen!"

Old Woman: "Stay away from the summoner!"

Kid: "You're a bad man!"

[The summoner gets up.]

Old Man: "Lady Yuna! Be careful!"

Yuna: "But it was really my fault to begin with."

[She walks to Tidus.]

Yuna: "I'm Yuna. Thank you so much for your help earlier."

Tidus: "I'm sorry about that. Wasn't that... Wasn't I not supposed
       to... Guess I...kind of overreacted."

Yuna: "Oh, no. I was...overconfident."

Tidus: "Um, I saw that aeon thing. That's amazing!"

Yuna: "Really? Do you think I can become high summoner?"

[Tidus nods; the kid walks over.]

Kid: "Lady Yuna, come play with me some more!"

[The kid leaves.]

Yuna: "So, tomorrow, then."

Tidus: "Tomorrow?"

Yuna: "We're going on the same boat, aren't we?"

Tidus: "Oh, really?"

Yuna: "We can talk more. You can tell me all about Zanarkand!"

[Yuna walks back; Wakka approaches.]

Wakka: "She's cute, ya?"
       R1 --> Yeah!
       R2 --> She's not my type.

       R1: "Don't get no ideas."

           Tidus: "No promises there, big guy."

       R2: "Then we're cool."

Tidus: "Hey, but what if she, like, comes on to me?"

Wakka: "That's not going to happen. If you get tired, let me know. I
       had a bed made for you."

[Tidus goes to sleep later in the Crusaders Lodge and has a dream
that he's on a pier near the beach. He sees Yuna there.]

Tidus: "Where's that boat?"

Yuna: "Everyone will find us if it doesn't come soon."

Tidus: "You really sure this is okay?"

Yuna: "Would you take me to Zanarkand?"

Rikku: "Hey!"

[Rikku appears.]

Rikku: "You said you'd go with me!"

Tidus: "Oh, hey... I, uh..."

Rikku: "I thought Wakka told you not to get any ideas?"

Yuna: "He did?"

Rikku: "Yeah, so you're coming with me!"

Jecht: "Hey! Stop dreaming!"

[Tidus sees Jecht on the shore.]

Jecht: "You, with a woman? You can't even catch a ball! Oh, what's
       the matter? Gonna cry again? Cry, cry. That's the only thing
       you're good for!"

Tidus: "I hate you."

Jecht: "Huh? What'd you say?"

Yuna: "You have to speak louder."

Tidus: "I hate you!"

Jecht: "Eh?"

Rikku: "That's the spirit!"

Yuna: "You can do it!"

[Tidus wakes up in the Lodge.]

Tidus: "I hate you!"

[He hears a woman's voice outside the tented structure; he listens.
It's the woman guardian quarreling with Wakka.]

Woman: "He's dead, okay? Dead! He does look a lot like Chappu. I was
       surprised, too, the first time I saw him. But no matter what
       he looks like, he isn't Chappu. You shouldn't have brought him
       here in the first place."

Wakka: "Yeah, but...he needed our help!"

Woman: "Excuses again?"

Wakka: "Yeah, but..."

Woman: "That's it. No more. Enough, Wakka!"

[She leaves and Wakka walks dejectedly back to the tent. He sees
Tidus prying at the conversation.]

Tidus: "Scary! So, who's Chappu?"

Wakka: "My little brother, Chappu. He looked like you."

Tidus: "He's dead?"

Wakka: "He was with the Crusaders when they fought Sin last year. He
       didn't make it. I first heard on the day of the tournament."

Tidus: "Oh, so that's why."

Wakka: "I became a guardian to fight Sin, ya?"

Tidus: "Revenge, then?"

Wakka: "That was the idea. I'm more worried about a stupid game now
       than avenging my brother. Well, after the next tournament, I'll
       be a guardian full-time. I know it kinda looks like I'm using
       you, but I'm not."

Tidus: "Don't worry. I mean, I owe you a lot. You really helped me
       out, you know? What I mean is...thanks, Wakka."

Wakka: "Stop, you're embarrassing me!"

[The next morning, Tidus walks out to the village square to find the
woman guardian and Wakka there, the latter carrying a big blue sword.]

Wakka: "Hey! Sleepyhead! Something I want to give you."

Tidus: "Whoa! You're giving this...to me?"

Wakka: "Yeah, use it well!"

[The woman speaks and is addressed as Lulu.]

Lulu: "That's the sword you gave Chappu."

Wakka: "Well, he never used it. Where's Yuna?"

Tidus: "We're taking the same boat as Yuna, right? Why do we gotta
       wait here?"

Wakka: "Yuna came to this village ten years ago, when the last Calm
       started."

Tidus: "The Calm?"

Wakka: "Since then, she's been like a little sister to me and Lulu.
       But she had the talent... She became an apprentice. Now, today,
       she leaves as a summoner."

Lulu: "This is our journey. We should leave together."

[Yuna comes down the temple steps, dragging a large box.]

Lulu: "You really don't need all that luggage."

Yuna: "They're not really my things. They're gifts for the temples
      we're to visit."

Wakka: "This isn't a vacation, Yuna."

Yuna: "I guess...I guess you're right."

[She leaves the box behind.]

Wakka: "Okay! Off we go!"

[The party leaves town and gets attacked by a canine monster.]

Wakka: "Here comes one now... Hey, why don't ya try out that sword I
       gave you?"

[Tidus slays it.]

Tidus: "No problem!"

Wakka: "Not too shabby! You kept up with him pretty well. Might make a
       good guardian someday."

[A bird monster flys into battle.]

Wakka: "A flyer! My kind of customer!"

[The party encounters a jelly-like monster soon after.]

Wakka: "That...looks like trouble."

Tidus: "Heh! Watch this!"

[Tidus does minor damage.]

Wakka: "Told you. Only magic can beat that thing. If you can't beat
       'em down, you gotta use magic of an element they dont like."

Tidus: "Magic? Element?"

Wakka: "Let's have our black mage show you what I mean. Lu! You're
       up!"

Lulu: "Clueless, aren't you? Good thing I'm here."

Narrative: [Elements]

           Magic and fiends have properties called elements. There are
           four elements: fire, ice, lightning, and water. Fire and
           ice are opposed, as are lightning and water.

Lulu: "Spells of ice work well against fire fiends... And ice fiends are
      weak against fire magic.

Tidus: "I get fire and ice, but what about lightning and water?"

Lulu: "Lighting and water are opposed, just like fire and ice. This one
      here is a water fiend, which means..."

[Lulu uses Thunder and ends the battle. On the ridge above Besaid,
the party stops and looks.]

Lulu: "Take your time."

Tidus: "Let's get going, man!"

Wakka: "We're gonna wait."

[Yuna walks by.]

Wakka: "Are you ready?"

[Everyone starts to leave.]

Tidus: "What's going on?"

[They walk down the road only a ways before the cat-person guardian
from before engages Tidus in battle.]

Wakka: "That's enough!"

[Kimahri shakes his head and walks away.]

Tidus: "What's with that guy?"

Lulu: "Kimarhi Ronso, of the Ronso tribe. He's learned the fiends'
      way of fighting."

Tidus: "That's not what I meant!"

Wakka: "He's another of Yuna's guardians."

Yuna: "Sometimes we don't understand him either. Kimahri doesn't talk
      much anyway. But he has protected me since I was a child!"

[Another tutorial battle occurs. A garuda flies down.]

Tidus: "A flyer...that's your department, right?"

Wakka: "True, true. But, uh... Why don't we let our summoner show us
       what's she's made of?"

Narrative: [Switching Members During Battle]

           Press [L1] during battle to switch in a character not
           currently being used. Just switch them in, and they're
           ready to go!

[Tidus is swapped out for Yuna.]

Wakka: "Your first real battle! Let's see some style!"

Lulu: "Show us what your training has taught you, Yuna!"

Narrative: [Summoning Aeons]

           Use the Summon command to have Yuna call an aeon to aid
           her in battle. Only Yuna can summon aeons. Use it when you
           need help against tough opponents. When aeons take damage,
           their HP decreases. Should their HP reach 0, they will
           leave battle and become unavailable for a time. Aeons
           recover HP at Save Spheres.

[Yuna summons Valefor and slays the ginormous bird. Another shows
up in battle soon after.]

Wakka: "Another one of those? No problem! Leave this one to me, ya?
       Say goodnight, birdie!"

[Wakka blinds the bird with a skill and the party kills it. They head
down to the beach and board the boat. Yuna's waves meet the people's,
and the boat starts to take off.]

Yuna: "Goodbye."

[The boat begins its voyage to Kilika Port.]

[Once out at sea, Tidus walks on the deck. He spots a man with
binoculars and manages to wrestle them out of his hands. He watches
around the deck, but gets them taken back when the previous man thinks
he's checking Yuna out. He finds Wakka after awhile.]

Wakka: "Come to think of it, I haven't told you where we're going!
       First to Kilika Island, then we change boats and head for
       Luca. 'Fore that, though, Yuna's gotta pray at the temple.
       I'll be guarding. We'll be praying for the Aurochs victory,
       too, so you come along, ya?"

Lulu: "Great plan."

Wakka: "Hey, it is a great plan!"

Tidus: "Don't look at me!"

[Tidus walks over to Yuna, who's surrounded by a crowd, even at sea.]

Man: "Word is that summoner's got noble blood!"

Man 2: "I heard she's Lord Braska's daughter!"

Man: "Ya don't say?"

Tidus: "Lord Braska's...daughter?"

[Tidus goes back to Wakka.]

Tidus: "So, is Yuna's father famous or something?"

Wakka: "She's the daughter of High Summoner Braska! You saw his statue
       at the temple. Lord Braska defeated Sin ten years ago. Yuna's
       the heir to a great legacy!"

Tidus: "It's tough when your father's famous."

[Wakka gets a quizzical look on his face.]

Lulu: "Wakka's...a bit lacking in the imagination department."

Tidus: "Thanks, Lulu. I'll keep that in mind."

[Tidus walks over to Yuna and they look out to sea, together.]

Yuna: "The wind...it's nice."

[They start laughing for no real reason.]

Yuna: "You're a blitzball player, aren't you? From Zanarkand, right?"

Tidus: "You hear that from Wakka? Wakka doesn't believe me at all."

Yuna: "But I believe you! I've heard, in Zanarkand...there is a great
      stadium, all lit up even at night! Great blitzball tournaments
      are held there, and the stands are always full!"

Tidus: "How do you know that?"

Yuna: "A man named Jecht told me. He was my father's guardian."

Tidus: "My father...his name is Jecht!

Yuna: "Amazing! You know, our meeting like this must be the blessing
      of Yevon!"

Tidus: "Sounds like him, but it can't be him."

Yuna: "Why not?"

Tidus: "My old man, he died. Ten years ago. Off the coast of
       Zanarkand."

Yuna: "I'm sorry."

Tidus: "He went out to sea for training one day...and never came back.
       And no one's seen him since."

Yuna: "Why, that's the day that Jecht came to Spira. It's true! I
      first met Jecht ten years and three months ago! I remember, that
      was the day my father left. The date fits, doesn't it?"

Tidus: "Yeah, but how would he get here?"

Yuna: "You're here, are you not?"

[The ship violently rocks as Sin emerges from the depths.]

Man: "Sin!"

[The man heads to the harpoon.]

Wakka: "What do you think you're doing? Stick a harpoon in it and
       we'll all get dragged under!"

Man: "Sin is going for Kilika! We gotta distract it!"

Man 2: "Our families are in Kilika! Forgive us, Lady Summoner!"

Wakka: "Wait! Oh, boy..."

[They harpoon Sin's fin, which makes it drag the boat through the
waves. Sinscales fly onto the deck and more appear after the others
are killed.]

Tidus: "How many of these things are there!? What? We hit the fin
       first?"

Narrative: [Fighting at a Distance]

           Regular sword attacks cannot hit targets at a distance,
           such as Sin's fin. Attack these enemies using magic or
           Wakka's blitzball attack.

[The party uses long-ranged attacks to knock the harpoon loose. Sin
swims away and the sea calms again. Wakka looks around for Tidus, but
he's nowhere to be found onboard. He dives in and finds him, but only
just before another boss attacks. They defeat it. FMV. Sin attacks
Kilika, engulfing it in a big wave. It sucks the debris into a 'halo'
above it before dropping everything and disappearing beneath the sea.]

T-Narrative: When Sin attacked Zanarkand that day, I woke up in Spira.
             I kept hoping it would work in reverse, too.

Yuna: "I will defeat Sin... I must defeat Sin.

T-Narrative: I was just fooling myself. Maybe it was that day...on the
             sea, under the burning sun. I started to give up hope. I
             was in a foreign world, I wasn't going home. This was my
             new reality, and I was stuck in it for good.

[The S.S. Liki pulls into Kilika Port somberly.]

[The people on the ship walk off, but Yuna runs to disembark.]

Yuna: "Greetings! I am the summoner Yuna. I have come from the temple
      in Besaid."

Woman: "M'lady Summoner!"

Yuna: "If there is no other summoner here, please allow me to perform
      the sending."

Man: "Thanks be to ye!"

Woman: "Our loved ones... We feared they would become fiends!"

Yuna: "Please, take me to them."

[Yuna, Kimahri, Lulu, and the villagers walk out of sight.]

Wakka: "We'll go see what we can do to help in town.

[The blitzball players run to help. Tidus finds the rest of the party
down by the water. Yuna stands by floating caskets. Tidus walks over
to Lulu.]

Tidus: Uh, what's a 'sending'? Are we going somewhere?"

Lulu: "You truly are clueless. Are you sure it's just your memory
      that's the problem? The dead need guidance. Filled with grief
      over their own death, they refuse to face their fate. They yearn
      to live on, and resent those still alive. You see, they envy the
      living. And in time, that envy turns to anger, even hate. Should
      these souls remain in Spira, they become fiends that pray on the
      living. Sad, isn't it? The sending takes them to the Farplane,
      where they may rest in peace."

Tidus: "Summoners do this?"

[Yuna walks into the water and a spout lifts her into the air as she
twirls her wand. The souls emerge from the caskets and rise up around
her. She finishes after awhile, and Tidus turns to Lulu.]

Tidus: "It must be tough being a summoner."

Lulu: "Yuna chose her own path. She knew from the beginning what it
      meant. All we can do is protect her along the way. Until the
      end."

Tidus: "Until the...end? What's the end?"

[The villagers and Yuna turn their attention to him; Lulu sighs.]

Lulu: "Until she defeats Sin."

Yuna: "I hope... I hope I did okay."

Lulu: "You did very well! They've reached the Farplane by now. But...
      no tears next time, hm?"

T-Narrative: I wished there would never be a next time. No more people
             being killed by Sin. No more sendings for Yuna. Everyone
             stood there watching her. It was strange, and somehow...
             horrifying. I never wanted to see it again.

[The next day, Tidus walks out of the inn. Datto jogs over.]

Datto: "Hey! You awake? Cap'n Wakka's waitin' for you!"

[Tidus finds Wakka.]

Wakka: "Ah, there you are! Besaid Aurochs! Huddle! On to the temple,
       where we pray for victory! High Summoner Ohalland used to live
       in the Kilika temple here. Yep, Lord Ohalland was once a great
       blitzer, you know?"

Tidus: "Wakka..."

Wakka: "Hm?"

Tidus: "Praying for victory's all good...but is this right?"

Wakka: "Something wrong with enjoying blitzball?"

Tidus: "Is this really the time?"

Wakka: "This is the only time! The players fight with all their
       strength; the fans cheer for their favorite team. They forget
       pain, suffering... Only the game matters! That's why blitz has
       been around for so long. Least that's what I think."

Tidus: "Whatever you say."

Wakka: "Let's play...and win! Right?"

Tidus: "Right!"

Wakka: "Temple's beyond the jungle there. Let's go!"

[They walk to the jungle edge and meet up with everyone.]

Wakka: "What's up?"

[Lulu looks at Tidus.]

Lulu: "Yuna's saying she wants you with us."

Yuna: "I want to ask you to be my guardian."

Wakka: "Yuna! What? This is no time for jokes, ya? He may be a
       blitzball whiz kid, but up against fiends, he's a newbie."

Yuna: "Not a guardian, then... I just want him nearby."

Tidus: "What? What do you mean?"

Yuna: "It's just that, well..."

Lulu: "We're all going to the temple anyway. Can't this wait till
      later?"

Yuna: "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have..."

Tidus: "There's nothing to be sorry about. I'm just not really sure
       what's going on."

Yuna: "My apologies."

[The party gets into a battle a ways down the path with a plant.]

Lulu: "Kimahri, why don't you use 'Lancet' on it?"

Tidus: "What's a 'Lancet'?

Lulu: "Normally, it's a skill that weakens enemies and heals the user.
      But when a Ronso uses it, that Ronso can sometimes learn fiends'
      abilities."

Tidus: "Hey, sounds cool!"

[The party moves down the road afterwards. They meet Luzzu and Gatta.]

Gatta: "Company, halt!"

Luzzu: "The fiend before us is Ochu, Lord of the Wood! We've had
       trouble with this one before. Remember, discretion is the
       better part of valor.

[The party burns down Ochu with ease.]

Luzzu: "A summoner and her guardians. Very impressive!"

Gatta: "Sir, we should fight, too!"

Luzzu: "We'll get our chance soon enough."

Gatta: "Young Crusaders gather round! We'll beat Sin into the ground!"

[Gatta runs off singing and the party heads to the temple's stairway.]

Wakka: "These stone steps have a history, you know? Yep, Lord Ohalland
       trained here at his peak."

[Tidus looks at two Aurochs, stretching nearby.]

Tidus: "A race, huh? Think you can beat me?"

Wakka: "Yuna, if you would."

Yuna: "Ready?"

[She runs off ahead of everyone.]

Wakka: "Hey! Hey!

[Tidus races up after everyone. He soon sees the Aurochs racing
back down, but this time they're fleeing.]

Datto: "L-Look out!"

Wakka: "Everyone, quick! Sinspawn!"

[A large beast breaks out of some stone paving, but is defeated.]

Tidus: "Yeesh!"

Wakka: "Sorry about that! Hoped to break you in a little slower."

Tidus: "Being a guardian's tiring!"

Wakka: "You handled yourself pretty well. You got talent."

Tidus: "Nah. So, what are these 'sinspawn' anyway?"

Lulu: "Fiends. They fall from Sin's body, and are left behind in its
      wake."

Wakka: "Leave 'em alone, and Sin comes back for 'em. You gotta be
       quick!"

T-Narrative: That moment when Wakka told me I had talent in battle...
             I think that was when I started seriously considering
             becoming a guardian.

[They all start walking up to the temple.]

Wakka: "So, uh...they got fiends in Zanarkand, too?"

Tidus: "Just a few. It's a big deal when one shows up, though. Hey!
       Since when have you believed me about Zanarkand, anyway?"

Wakka: "I been thinking. Maybe people Sin gets to don't die. Maybe
       Sin carries 'em through time. Like a thousand years through
       time. And then, one day, maybe they just pop back, see?"

Lulu: "Amazing. Simply amazing. You make up one theory after another,
      refusing to face the simple truth. Sin didn't take Chappu
      anywhere. Sin crushed him and left him on the Djose shore! Your
      brother won't just pop back. Oh, and one more thing. No matter
      how much you want it, no one can take Chappu's place. No one
      can replace Sir Jecht, for that matter. And there's no
      replacement for Lord Braska, either. It's pointless to think
      about it, and sad."

[Lulu and Yuna walk off.]

Wakka: "I...I could never be what Chappu was. Well, stuff happens.
       Best not to worry."

T-Narrative: Wakka, Lulu, and Wakka's brother Chappu. Something had
             happened between them a long time ago. I was sure of it.
             Well, whatever it was, it was none of my business, that's
             for sure. Best not to go there.

[The party walks up to the temple and sees a group walking to them.]

Wakka: "You here to pray for victory, too?"

Man: "Us? Pray? Who needs to pray? The Luca Goers always win!"

Wakka: "Oh, yeah? Then why are you here?"

Man 2: "We've been praying for some competition this year!"

Man: "So, what's your goal this time? You gonna 'do your best' again?
     Ha! It's too bad your best isn't good enough! Why even bother
     showing up?"

Tidus: "This time, we play to win!"

Man: "Oooh! Play away! Just remember even kids can play, boys."

Wakka: "See you in the finals!"

Tidus: "We'll beat them. We have to!"

Yuna: "You know that team?"

Tidus: "Putting people down... They're as bad as my old man!"

Yuna: "But, Sir Jecht was a kind and gentle man!"

Tidus: "Well, not my Jecht."

T-Narrative: Even ten years after he left...just thinking about my old
             man got me angry. But maybe that was just my way of keep-
             -ing him... Nah.

[The party walks inside and Wakka prays at Ohalland's statue.]

Wakka: "Lord Ohalland, guide our feet."
       R1 --> Pray
       R2 --> Stand and watch.

       R1: "
       R2: "

[A woman and a large man exit the Cloister.]

Woman: "A summoner, are you?"

Yuna: "My name is Yuna -- I come from the Isle of Besaid."

Dona: "Dona. So, you're High Summoner Braska's daughter. That's quite
      a name to live up to. My, my, my... And all these people are
      your guardians? My, what a rabble! As I recall, Lord Braska had
      only two guardians. Quality over quantity, my dear. Whatever
      were you thinking? I have need of only one guardian. Right,
      Barthello?"

Yuna: "I only have as many guardians as there are people I can trust.
      I trust them all with my life! To have so many guardians is a
      joy, and an honor! Even more so than being my father's daughter.
      Of course, I would never think of questioning your ways, either.
      So, Lady Dona, I ask of you: please leave us in peace."

Dona: "You do what you want. Barthello, we're leaving."

[And they do.]

T-Narrative: A guardian is someone a summoner can rely on. Someone
             she can trust with her life. I wondered, did Yuna feel
             that way about me? What's she smiling about?

[All walk to an elevator that leads to the Cloister.]

Wakka: "The fayth is below. Let's do it!"

Tidus: "The 'fayth?'"

Lulu: "But first, the Cloister of Trials. Kimahri? Wakka? Ready?"

Yuna: "Strength, everyone!"

[Kimahri pushes Tidus off the elevator.]

Tidus: "Hey, what gives?"

Lulu: "You're not a guardian yet."

Yuna: "We'll be back as soon as we can, okay?"

[They go down.]

Tidus: "Oh, sure! Soon like 'tomorrow' soon, I bet!"

[The elevator returns. Dona and Barthello return, too.]

Dona: "Where's Yuna?"

[Tidus points down.]

Dona: "Then why are you here?"

Tidus: "Hey, I'm not a guardian, so I'm not supposed to go in, right?"

Dona: "Not a guardian, you say?"

[Barthello picks him up.]

Tidus: "Hey! Wait! Ah! Lemme go! Hey! What's the big idea?"

Dona: "Just a little game."

[The elevator starts to go down.]

Tidus: "This is bad, really bad."

[Tidus comes to a door at the bottom.]

Narrative: [Go in./Wait here.]

[Tidus goes up to the door.]

Tidus: "Only guardians allowed, and I'm sure no guardian. Well, I
       guess it's too late now."

[Tidus goes through the trials alone and comes to the fayth chamber.]

Wakka: "Whoa, whoa, whoa!"

Tidus: "It was Dona and that big musclehead man!"

Lulu: "Yuna will be the one to suffer the consequences!"

Tidus: "What consequences?"

Wakka: "She could be excommunicated!

[Tidus talks to Lulu.]

Lulu: "The chamber beyond is a sacred place. Only summoners may enter."

Tidus: "What, even guardians can't go?"

Wakka: "It's taboo!"

[Tidus talks to Wakka.]

Wakka: "Just wait."

Tidus: "So, what's in there anyway?"

Wakka: "The fayth, remember?"

Tidus: "Oh yeah, that thing. Right."

Lulu: "The fayth are people who gave their lives to battle Sin. Yevon
      took their souls, willingly given from their still-living
      bodies."

Tidus: "Huh?"

Lulu: "Now they live forever, trapped in statues. But when a summoner
      beckons, the souls of the fayth emerge once again. That's what
      we call an aeon."

Tidus: "All that in this room? S-So what's Yuna doing in there?"

Wakka: "She prays with all her heart for a way to defeat Sin.

[Yuna stumbles out soon after.]

T-Narrative: There was something I didn't tell anyone else that day.
             That song we heard there, in the temple... I knew it from
             my childhood. It was proof that Spira and Zanarkand were
             connected somehow. At least to me it was. Maybe that's
             why, suddenly, I felt like...I just wanted to go home. I
             tried to say something, to tell them. But the words
             wouldn't come.

[Yuna's new aeon is called 'Ifrit' by default. The party leaves and
finds a crowd waiting at the mount for Braska's daughter.]

T-Narrative: I thought I had put my feelings for Zanarkand behind me.
             But they were there, and they grew inside me, bigger and
             bigger, till I was just about ready to burst.

[The party starts to leave the temple and Tidus stops. Yuna, too.]

Yuna: "Are...are you okay?"

Tidus: "I...I don't know."

Yuna: "What do you want to do?"

Tidus: "To scream real loud."

[Tidus does scream real loud, startling his other party members. Back
in town, he can choose 'Embark.' or 'Not yet.' for the ship.]

Wakka: "Off to Luca at last! The matches start as soon as we get
       there, so rest up on the way, ya?"

[The boat leaves with the Kilika Beasts and Goers onboard, too.]

[It's nighttime now. Lulu and Wakka go up top to converse, and Yuna
once again becomes the center of attention. Even some Goers walk over
to her. Tidus goes topside and stumbles upon Wakka and Lulu's convo,
so he eavesdrops.]

Lulu: "Well? Say something. You'll take responsibility?"

Wakka: "Relax! He's bound to know someone in Luca."

Lulu: "And if not?'

Wakka: "He could always join a blitz team. Anyhow, it's better than
       just leaving him in Besaid!"

Lulu: "What? Just leaving him in Luca?"

Wakka: "What do you want me to do?"

Lulu: "Yuna wants to make him a guardian."

Wakka: "Oh yeah, geez... There's that too, eh?"

Lulu: "And whose fault is that?"

Wakka: "Not mine!"

[Lulu stares at him.]

Wakka: "It is my fault, huh?

[Tidus walks onto the deck and finds a blitzball. Flashback to when
he was little, just trying to kick the ball right.]

Jecht: "Well, well, trying to follow in my footsteps, are you? I
       usually charge for lessongs, you know... That shot is done...
       like this!"

[Jecht jumps into the air with the ball.]

Jecht: "You can't do it, kid. But don't worry, my boy. You're not
       the only one. No one else can do it. I'm the best!"

[The flashback ends.]

Narrative: [The Jecht Shot Challenge]

           Memories of that day still haunt Tidus and interfere with
           his concentration. Try to shake off the memories and
           successfully perform the Jecht Shot.

[If Tidus successfully completes the Jecht Shot:]

Tidus: "The best? Yeah, right."

[The Aurochs and Yuna walk over.]

Wakka: "Whoa! What's that called?"

Tidus: "Doesn't have a name. Anyone can do it if they try."

Wakka: "Show us one more time, ya?"

[If Tidus doesn't accomplish a Jecht Shot:]

Jecht: Told you you couldn't do it!

[Either way, Tidus walks over to Yuna when he's finished.]

Yuna: "That was the Jecht Shot, wasn't it?"

Tidus: "How do you know that?"

Yuna: "Sir Jecht showed it to me when I was a child. He called it the
      'Sublimely Magnificent Jecht Shot Mark III.'"

Tidus: "Stupid name, huh? You know what? There is no Mark I or Mark
       II, you know? My old crowd said the name Mark III was just
       something to hook the crowd. He said they'd come back every
       night expecting to see Mark I and Mark II. And, they really
       did come back. I used to get so mad. Is he alive, you think?"

Yuna: "I don't know. But, Sir Jecht was my father's guardian."

Tidus: "So, he's famous here, too?"

Yuna: "Yes. So if anything happened to him, I should think word would
      get around fast."

Tidus: "Uh-huh."

Yuna: "What would you do, if you found him?"

Tidus: "Who knows? I thought he died ten years ago. Well... I'd
       probably just smack him one. After everything he put Mom and
       me through. And because he was famous, and I was always...
       Well, you should know, Yuna. Your father's famous, too.
       Everyone in Spira knows him, right? Ain't it tough?"

Yuna: "It is hard to follow in his footsteps, as a summoner."

Tidus: "Sure."

Yuna: "But the honor of having a father like that surpasses all that,
      I think."

Tidus: "Well, there wasn't much to honor about my old man, that's for
       sure."

Yuna: "You shouldn't say that about your father!"

Tidus: "I got the right!"

Yuna: "I guess you do."

[Tidus gets smacked with a blitzball.]

Wakka: "Show me that move again!

T-Narrative: I didn't think my old man would come to Luca. He never
             did like watching other people play. But I couldn't help
             feeling something bad was gonna happen. And these
             feelings of mine are usually right. Sure, I had told
             Wakka I'd help him win the tournament. But I wasn't sure
             I had it in me to play at all anymore.

[The next day, the Wino pulls into Luca's port.]

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

[As the ships pull in, two announcers -- Bobba and Jimma -- narrate
the show that's about to start from their booth somewhere.]

Bobba: "Ah, over there! The ships carrying the players are arriving
       now! This would be dock number 2. All the way from Kilika,
       it's the Kilika Beasts! High Summoner Ohalland used to play
       for them -- a big name to live up to. Their hometown was
       recently attacked by Sin. Isn't that right, Jimma?"

Jimma: "Yes, Bobba. They're going to be pulling out all the stops to
       try and bring back the cup this year."

Bobba: "Exciting, isn't it, folks? Our next team off the ramp is...
       Well, well, well! If it isn't the Besaid Aurochs! They're a
       living, breathing, statistical impossibility! I've never seen
       a team this bad! That's right! In twenty-three years they've
       never made it past the first round! Only a few die-hard fans
       are in the audience today."

Jimma: "Best of luck to them, and a safe journey back to Besaid."

Bobba: "Right, Jimma. Moving right along, our next team is... Here
       they are, folks! Our very own Luca Goers! They've got power!
       They've got speed! They've got teamwork! They're an all-around
       first-class team! And they're back home in Luca!"

Jimma: "Without a doubt, they are the favorite this year, Bobba. And
       after the way they dominated last year, it'd take a miracle
       for them to lose today."

Bobba: "You can say that again, Jimma. Look at the crowd, folks! Look
       at the crowd! Looks like all of Luca has turned out to cheer
       the Goers on! They know, I know, and you know, folks! The Luca
       Goers are number one!"

[Tidus walks to the Aurochs, angry at the coverage.]

Wakka: "It's like this every year, ya? Don't let it bother you."

[Tidus gets out a megaphone (!?) and stands on a stack of crates.]

Tidus: "Stop right there, Goers! You guys are smilin' now, but not
       for long! 'Cause this year, us Aurochs are takin' the cup!"

[Tidus gets down after ruining the Goers' fun.]

Wakka: "What in Yevon's name were you doing up there?"

Datto: "We sure stood out, though!"

Letty: "We were on the sphere!"

Datto: "We were?"

[Three people run by.]

Man: "Maester Mika is here!"

Woman: "Already?"

Man 2: "The number 3 dock!"

Tidus: "What's up now?"

Yuna: "Maester Mike has arrived, that's what!"

Tidus: "Mika? Maester?"

Lulu: "Maester Mike is the leader of all the peoples of Spira. He's
      come all the way from Bevelle. The tournament is being held to
      honor his fifty years as maester."

Tidus: "Fifty years? Shouldn't he be, uh, retired by now?"

Wakka: "Hey! Mind your mouth, now."

Yuna: "Let's all go see him!

[They head over to Dock 3. A large crowd is there.]

Tidus: "Can't see a thing!"

Wakka: "Shhhh!"

[A strange man with a blue coif heads off the maester's boat.]

Man: "That's a Guado, right?"

Woman: "Who could it be?"

Man: "Isn't that...Maester Seymour?"

[An old man walks off the boat, too.]

Mika: "People of Spira, I thank you for your generous welcome. Rise,
      Maester Seymour. And all of you as well. I present to you...the
      son of Maester Jyscal Guado, who departed for the Farplane a
      fortnight past. As some of you already know, he has been
      officially ordained a maester of Yevon."

Seymour: "I am Seymour Guado. I am honored to receive the title of
         maester. In life, my father Jyscal worked to foster
         friendship between man and Guado. I vow to carry on his
         legacy, and to fulfill my duties as maester to the best of
         my abilities.

[Tidus just stands there while the rest pray.]

Wakka: "You, too! Bow your head!

[Mike leaves with Seymour, but not before the latter gets a good look
at Yuna.]

Wakka: "Really psyches you up, ya? All right! Last meeting before the
       match! Hustle!

[Later on, Tidus walks into the locker room.]

Tidus: "Where's Wakka?"

Datto: "At the match-up draws."

Letty: "We had to play the Goers in the first match last year. The
       year before that, and the one before that, too!"

Keepa: "Well, we would've lost to anyone anyway."

[Wakka enters.]

Datto: "Cap'n Wakka!"

Wakka: "We're playin' the Al Bhed Psyches first. If we win, we're in
       the finals! That's right, we got seeded! Two wins and we're
       the champions! First things first. Let's go over the basics
       again, boys."

           R1: In blitzball, there are five players per team in the
               sphere pool. The Overhead Map shows all players' current
               positions and the direction each is facing. Here, only
               one team is shown on the field. Tidus is carrying the
               ball now. The ball carrier is displayed as a circled
               arrow on the Map. Now let's watch the players move. It
               may seem confusing at first, but it's actually quite
               simple. By default, player movement is set to Auto, so
               everyone moves around the pool automatically. Use the
               Overhead Map to check the players' positions. The tri-
               -angular frame inside the red circle is the opposing
               team's goal. Here it is. This goal is always on the
               left-hand side of the Overhead Map. Let's resume. Try
               to keep track of your position in relation to the goal.
               Next, let's try moving the ball carrier manually. Press
               (/\). Now you've enabled Manual movement. Press (D-Pad)
               to move the player manually. Only the ball carrier can
               be moved manually. All other players stay on Auto. Note
               that it becomes harder to manage your teammates while
               manually controlling the carrier. This mode is
               recommended for veteran blitzers. Press (/\) again. Now
               you're back on Auto movement. Try switching between
               Manual and Auto to get a feel for both modes. In Manual
               Mode A, the direction of movement corresponds to the
               Overhead Map. (D-left) moves the player toward the
               opposing team's goal, and (D-right) toward your own
               team's goal. In addition to Manual A, there is also a
               mode called Manual B. Stick with Auto movement for now.
               Movement modes are only applicable when you're on
               offense. When you're on defense, your entire team moves
               on auto.

               Summary 1:
               -Use the Overhead Map to keep track of play.
               -Change movement modes with (/\).
               -Players move automatically when on defense.

           R2: In order to make a player perform an action, you must
               choose an action command. You can open the action
               command window by pressing the ([]) button. Press ([])
               now. The game pauses while the action command window is
               open, so you have ample time to think about your next
               move. There are three available commands: Pass, Shoot,
               and Dribble. Dribble simply makes your player resume
               movement. Pass and Shoot are the most important
               commands.

               Summary 2:
               -([]) opens the action commands window.
               -The three commands are Pass, Shoot, and Dribble.
               -Dribble simply makes the player resume movement.

           R3: Now, let's take a look at passing. Press ([]) now.
               Select Pass. Select a receiver for your pass. His stats
               are shown at the top right. Your pass is copmlete, and
               now _____ has the ball. Stats determine the outcome of
               each pass. Take a look at the number shown next to PA.
               That number, ___, represents _____'s passing accuracy.
               Let's pass the ball back to Tidus. Open the command
               window by pressing ([]). Keep an eye on the PA score,
               now at __, as the ball travels back to Tidus. Did you
               notice the gradual decrease in PA? The friction of the
               water causes the pass's PA to gradually decrease. If
               its PA reaches 0, the pass becomes uncatchable. Now
               let's watch Tidus throw a bad pass. We'll set his PA
               to 3. Press ([]) and pass the ball. Keep an eye on
               Tidus's PA, now at 3. When a pass fails, the ball
               becomes loose. A loose ball can be claimed by anyone.
               Therefore, a player with high PA can successfully throw
               longer passes. Likewise, a player with low PA often
               throws bad passes, giving the other team a chance at
               the ball.

               Summary 3:
               -PA represents passing accuracy.
               -Each pass loses PA the farther it travels.
               -Once PA reaches 0, the pass becomes uncatchable.

           R4: Now let's look at how to shoot. Shooting is very
               similar to passing. A player's shooting accuracy is
               displayed as SH. Check Tidus's SH, now at 10. A shot
               loses SH as it travels through the water, just as a
               pass loses PA. A shot that reaches the goal with SH of
               at least 1 will score. If a shot's SH is depleted, it
               will fail. A goalkeeper defends the goal from Tidus's
               shots. Let's do it. Open the command window by pressing
               ([]). Select Shoot. Once you select Shoot, the goal-
               -keeper's stats appear beneath yours. Your teammates'
               stats are displayed on a blue background. The opposing
               team's stats are displayed on a red background. CA
               represents the goalkeeper's ability to catch incoming
               shots. In this example, Raudy's goalkeeping ability is
               shown as 8. Let's resume. Keep an eye on the shot's SH
               as it decreases. Check Tidus's SH now. Since the shot
               lost some SH as it travelled through the water, it is
               currently at 3. Here, we take the shot's SH and
               subtract the goalkeeper's CA. If no SH remains, then
               the shot fails. Be aware that the actual CA applied
               here is randomized, ranging from 50 to 150 percent of
               the goalie's current CA. Here the goalkeeper has a CA
               of 8, so the actual amount subtracted may vary from 4
               to 12. So, let's see whether the shot's SH will remain
               above 0. The shot failed because its SH hit 0. Now
               let's try scoring a goal. Switch to Manual movement,
               swim closer to the goal, and try shooting from there.
               The shot was successful because SH is at __.

               Summary 4:
               -SH represents shooting accuracy.
               -Each shot loses SH the farther it travels.
               -The goalie's CA is subtracted from SH.
               -If final SH is less than or equal to 0, the shot fails.

           R5: In blitzball, players expend HP to perform actions.
               Think of HP here as stamina, because players remain
               conscious even if their HP drops to 0. The first thing
               to remember is that whoever has the ball steadily
               loses HP while carrying it through the water. Watch
               how Tidus's HP falls from 100 as he carries the ball.
               As you can see, HP decreases when the ball is carried.
               Shooting and passing also consume HP. Let's take a
               look. Select Shoot. Each shot consumes 10 HP. Watch
               closely as Tidus loses 10 HP. As you can see, his HP
               decreased from 26 to 16. In blitzball, all actions
               require HP. Now let's see what happens when HP runs
               low. Players can still shoot even if their HP falls
               below 10. But when they do, their shots are only half
               as effective. Whenever HP is too low, the commands are
               highlighted blue. Also, note that SH is reduced from
               10 to 5. Each player slowly regains HP once he is rid
               of the ball.

               Summary 5:
               -Carrying the ball consumes HP.
               -Players regain HP once rid of the ball.
               -Passing and shooting require HP.
               -Insufficient HP reduces PA and SH by half.

           R6: An encounter occurs when opposing players come in
               contact with the ball carrier. If you are the ball
               carrier, the action command manu will open. You must
               then decide on a course of action in the face of
               opposing players.  For now, select No Break. We'll
               explain Breakthroughs later. Bickson stands in Tidus's
               way. His stats are displayed at the top right. Next,
               the action command window appears. Select Pass for now.
               Normally the ball is thrown here. It would lose PA as
               it travels through the water. But in an encounter,
               opposing players try to block your passes and shots.
               BL repreesents a player's skill at blocking. Here,
               Bickson's blocking stat is 2. The pass loses an amount
               of PA equal to Bickson's BL. The actual calculation is
               slightly randomized. If PA falls to 0 or less, the ball
               is intercepted by the opposing player. In this example,
               PA is 10, and BL is 2. The estimated result is
               10 - 2 = 8. As long as PA is at least 1, the pass goes
               through. Once through, the pass continues to expend PA
               as it travels toward its intended receiver. Watch PA
               closely as we resume play. The defender reduced the PA
               of the pass when he got a hand on it. Now let's see
               what happens when the defender's BL is much higher.
               This time, his BL is 18. The defender's high BL reduced
               the PA of the pass to 0, resulting in a turnover. Some
               encounters include multiple defenders. Let's see how
               that works. Bickson and Abus block your way. Their
               stats are shown at the top right. Bickson's BL is 4,
               and Abus's BL is 2. 10 - (4+2) = 4, but since the
               results are slightly randomized it won't necessarily
               equal 4. The pass went through, but its PA fell to 0
               before reaching the receiver, resulting in a bad pass.
               Now let's try shooting a goal. When you attempt to
               shoot, the goalkeeper also comes in, so you're now
               facing three opponents. Subtract the stats shown
               beneath SH from its current value of 10 to determine
               whether or not the shot scores.

               Summary 6:
               -Defenders try to force encounters to block shots and
                passes.
               -BL reduces effective PA and SH.
               -Multiple defenders combine their BL.

           R7: We'll look at breakthroughs in this section. You've
               encountered three opposing players. PA represents
               passing accuracy. Here, the player PA is 17. The
               defenders' block stats appear beneath PA. The result
               of 17 - (11+5+3) is less than 0, so any attempt at
               passing will surely fail. Let's try a breakthrough
               here. The ball carrier will try to shake off defenders
               by breaking through their tackles. If he withstands
               their tackles, the breakthrough succeeds and fewer
               defenders remain. Let's try breaking through Graav.
               Keep an eye on Graav's AT during the breakthrough.
               Select Break to Graav in the Breakthrough menu. You've
               decided to break through Graav before making your next
               move. Now Graav will tackle Tidus. If Tidus can't
               withstand the tackle, he'll give up the ball. It takes
               endurance (EN) to withstand tackles. Right now, Tidus's
               EN is 11. AT tells us how hard a tackle will hit. This
               defender's AT is 7. Subtract AT from EN to determine
               the outcome of a tackle. If EN is reduced to 0, then
               the tackle steals the ball. Watch EN closely. Tidus
               endured the tackle and broke through Graav. The
               breakthrough was a success! Only two defenders remain
               in the way. Look at the stats shown underneath PA.
               Since Graav is out of the picture, he can't block
               passes anymore. The math is now 17 - (5+3). Completing
               a pass should be much easier now. Break through as many
               defenders as you can to complete more passes and score
               more goals.

               Summary 7:
               -Expect tackles when breaking through.
               -AT represents each tackle's strength.
               -EN is the ball carrier's endurance.
               -EN - AT decides the outcome of each tackle.
               -Shots & passes are easier after breakthrough.

           R8: Players can learn techniques from their opponents. This
               is called techcopy. First, have one of your players
               mark an opponent who knows a desirable technique. Now
               that player will keep an eye on that opponent in order
               to learn his techniques. Select Break to Bickson here.
               'Techcopy!' appears at the top of the screen when a
               player uses a technique during a game. This indicates a
               window of opportunity to learn that technique. Press
               (X) at the right time in order to learn it. Let's try
               it now. Techcopy failed! Just remember that the player
               who learns the technique is not necessarily the one it
               is used against. Players who have marked that opponent
               are the ones who can learn his techinques. If multiple
               players have marked him, only one will learn at any
               one time. Your players may have trouble learning
               techniques, though, if they are of lower levels than
               their respective targets. Once you've learned a new
               technique, you can equip it at halftime or at the start
               of the next match.

               Summary 8:
               -Mark opponents to learn their techniques.
               -Press (X) when 'Techcopy!' appears.
               -Techcopy fails if opponent's level is too high.

           R9: HP
               -Spent when carrying the ball.
               -Spent when shooting and passing.
               -Recovers when moving without the ball.
               -PA and SH are halved when HP is too low.

               EN (Endurance)
               -Ability to withstand tackles.
               -Opposing stat: AT.

               PA
               -Passing accuracy.
               -Higher PA enables longer passes.
               -Opposing stat: BL.

               SH
               -Shooting skill.
               -Higher SH enables longer shots.
               -Opposing stats: BL, CA.

               AT
               -Attack strength of tackles.
               -Opposing stat: EN.

               BL
               -Skill at blocking passes & shots
               -Opposing stats: PA, SH.

               CA
               -Goalie's skill at catching shots.
               -Opposing stat: SH.

          R10: Poison accelerates the loss of HP while the player has
               the ball. Poisoned players do not recover HP even when
               rid of the ball. In time, poison runs its course.
               Poison also disables techniques. Shooting techs are
               lost first, followed by tackling techs and passing
               techs if the poison effects are stacked with Pile
               Venom.

               A player becomes unable to act when put to sleep. The
               player will wake after a while, or when he is hit by
               the ball.

               Wither reduces a single stat by half. The effects wear
               off over time.

          R11: You can learn blitzball techniques by techcopying them
               from opposing players, or by using the prizes given to
               the top teams of each season or tournament. Initially,
               each player can only learn certain techniques. But by
               learning certain key techniques, a player can increase
               the number of techniques available to him. The required
               key techniques vary by player. Each time a player
               learns a key technique, he gains access to a broader
               range of techniques.

          R12: Ten games are played during a league season, with the
               winner determined by total points. 3 points are awarded
               for a win, and 1 point for a tie. You can press (/\) to
               forfeit a game, but only when your team is losing.
               Tournaments span two to three matches. There are no
               draws, so a match ending with tied scores goes into
               overtime. You can press (/\) to forfeit a game, but
               only when your team is losing. Exhibition games are
               for practice. No experience points are awarded for
               playing, but you can copy techniques. Press (/\) at
               any time to forfeit the game.

          R13: [Ends tutorial.]

[Yuna comes in once the tutorial's been viewed to some extent.]

Yuna: "There you are! Someone said they saw Sir Auron in a cafe!"

Tidus: "Au-Auron?"

Yuna: "Yes, Sir Auron! Let's go find him!"

Wakka: "Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! The game starts like real soon!
       C-Come back quick, ya?"

Tidus: "Hey, I'll be back."

Wakka: "Yeah, okay."

Tidus: "Hey, Wakka. You're stiff, man. No, no, not your face. Just
       breathe out, relax. Like this. Just breathe, yeah!"

Yuna: "Maybe now we can find Sir Jecht."

Tidus: "Huh? How?"

Yuna: "Sir Auron was also my father's guardian. So, he might know
      where Sir Jecht is. Let's go now!"

T-Narrative: It didn't even occur to me to think that the Auron Yuna
             was talking about...and the one I knew from Zanarkand
             could be two different people. I don't know why, but I
             knew it was the same guy. I knew it was the same Auron.

[Tidus walks after Yuna, who's run ahead. He sees some Al Bhed.]

Al Bhed: "Y myto summoner!" ["A lady summoner!"]

Al Bhed 2: "Fa sicd nabund." ["We must report."]

Tidus: "Hey! Al Bhed Psyches, right? Some Al Bhed saved me the other
       day, and... This girl Rikku gave me food and... Uh... You don't
       understand me, do you? Uh, anyway... If you meet Rikku, tell
       her thanks for me. Oh, and as for the first game? May the best
       team win!

[Yuna and Tidus walk out of the stadium (with Kimahri, of course), and
a sphere-camera crew starts to film Yuna.]

Yuna: "I'm sorry, please let me through. Hey, let's go."

Tidus: "You're really famous."

Yuna: "I hope we don't get separated"

Tidus: "Yuna!"

[He does a high-pitched whistle.]

Yuna: "What was that?"

Tidus: "In Zanarkand, we do this to cheer on blitz players. You try
       it, too! Put your fingers in your mouth like this!"

Yuna: "Like...this?"

Tidus: "Uh-uh, not like that. Like this. Then, you just blow."

[Yuna tries and fails.]

Yuna: "It's not working."

Tidus: "Practice!"

Yuna: "Okay."

Tidus: "Hay, use that if we get separated. Then, I'll come running,
       okay? Well, guess we should just stick together, then, till
       you can do it."

Yuna: "Yes, sir!"

[They come to the village square.]

Tidus: "Whoa! This is a pretty big town!"

Yuna: "Luca is the second largest city in Spira."

Tidus: "I thought every town was little -- you know, like Besaid and
       Kilika."

Yuna: "Towns don't usually get bigger than that. Because when a lot
      of people start to gather..."

Tidus: "Sin...? What about Luca? It's safe here?"

Yuna: "It's not any different, but the stadium is here. The Crusaders
      fight to protect it with all their strength."

Tidus: "They protect the stadium?"

Yuna: "Blitzball's really the only entertainment that we have. Spira's
      a little short on fun these days."

Tidus: "Whoa! Talk about pressure!"

Yuna: "That's right! Is Zanarkand like this, too?"

Tidus: "Well, there are more buildings. All tall ones and cramped
       together."

Yuna: "They must be so tall! Don't you ever get dizzy?"

[Tidus laughs.]

Yuna: "Let's go find Sir Auron!"

[They head into the cafe but see no man in red.]

Tidus: "Auron's not here."

[Yuna goes to investigate. Meanwhile, two mean-looking Ronso are
about to gang up on Kimahri.]

Yenke: "Why not talk, Kimahri? Not see Yenke for ten years! Say
       something! Kimahri forget Yenke? Forget Biran?"

Biran: "Leave Kimahri, Yenke. Kimahri is small Ronso. Kimahri so
       small can't see Yenke and Biran's faces."

Yenke: "Kimahri forget Ronso friends? We taught you much at time of
       horn-molt! Biran taught Kimahri to be strong Ronso."

Biran: "Maybe taught too much."

Tidus: "Take 'em on!

[Kimahri uppercuts Yenke and knocks him out.]

Bartender: "Take it outside! The tournament's starting, you hear?"

[Biran punches Kimahri. Tidus looks at a sphere screen.]

Tidus: "The game!"

Mika: "Today, on this glorious day, players from all over Spira have
      assembled here...to participate in this great contest of
      bravery, skill, and strength. All of these fine teams, equally
      renowned, deserve to win the cup today. Such is the nature of
      this contest. Let us, the spectators, play our role accordingly:
      Let us sing to the glory of the winners, and applaud equally the
      valor of the defeated. Contestants, may Yevon be with you."

[FMV. The sphere pool starts to fill up in preparation for the games.
The Aurochs take their places against the Psyches and the tip-off
begins the match. Meanwhile, in the cafe, Tidus looks around for
Yuna.]

Tidus: "Kimahri! Yuna's gone!"

[The two bolt outside and find Lulu approaching.]

Lulu: "Where in Spira have you been!?"

Tidus: "Huh?"

Lulu: "Yuna's been kidnapped by the Al Bhed Psyches. In exchange for
      her safe return, they want the Aurochs to lose."

Tidus: "What!?"

Lulu: "If they're only blitzball players, I doubt they'd do anything
      drastic. But we shouldn't take chances. Let's go get her."

Tidus: "I'm going too! This will be no problem. They're telling the
       Aurochs to throw the game, as if they needed to! I mean, how
       good a team can they be?"

Lulu: "Wakka said the same thing. He'll take care of the game. We
      should go get Yuna. The Al Bhed boat is in dock 4. Let's go."

[They run down to the dock area and are attacked by machines.]

Tidus: ""Whoa! What are they?"

Lulu: "Ancient machina, salvaged by the Al Bhed. They are most
      vulnerable to lightning."

[They defeat them and move on, encountering some more in the third
dock and fourth dock areas.]

Tidus: "What's up with these guys?"

Lulu: "The Al Bhed were expecting us."

[They defeat the machina. Their attention drifts to the sphere
monitor, which is covering the Aurochs/Psyches game.]

Bobba: "The Aurochs are keeping the score tied with some excellent
       defense, folks! Ow! He'll feel that one in the morning!"

Jimma: "But the referee doesn't call the foul! Wakka's taking a real
       beating out there."

Tidus: "Still in there!"

Lulu: "He won't last. Wakka's always like that."

Tidus: "Ouch."

Lulu: "Let's go."

[The salvage boat is taking off as the party runs.]

Lulu: "Let's go.

[They jump on just in time...well, to get attacked by a gigantic
machina that rises up from the belly of the ship.]

Tidus: "Hey, we can use this crane!"

[Tidus uses the Trigger 'Use Crane.' Nothing happens.]

Tidus: "C'mon, move!"

Lulu: "It's probably out of power."

[Lulu casts Thunder on it.]

Narrative: The crane seems to respond.

[Tidus uses 'Use Crane' after its juiced up, ripping its top gears
off. They blow it up once its defenceless, and Yuna runs out of the
door nearby.]

Lulu: "I hope you hurt them."

Yuna: "A little."

[Tidus walks over to a beaten-up guard.]

Yuna: "What is it?"

Tidus: "There were these Al Bhed that saved my life when I first came
       to Spira. They took me on their ship, even gave me food. I was
       kinda hoping this was the same ship. But it's not. I wonder if
       they're all gone."

Yuna: "What happened?"

Tidus: "Sin came up near us. I made it out okay, but I don't know
       what happened to their ship."

Yuna: "Um, was there anyone called Cid on the ship."

Tidus: "I don't know. They were all speaking that Al Bhed language."

Yuna: "I see..."

Tidus: "So who's Cid?"

Yuna: "He's my uncle, but I've never actually met him."

Tidus: "Wait. That means you're Al Bhed, too, Yuna?"

Yuna: "On my mother's side, yes. Cid is my mother's brother. He
      became distant after my mother married. But she told me to seek
      him out if I ever needed help."

Tidus: "You're worried he was...?"

Lulu: "Don't tell Wakka about Yuna's lineage. The thing about Wakka
      -- he never had much love for the Al Bhed."

Tidus: "Whoa! I gotta tell Wakka!"

Lulu: "I thought I told you not to tell Wakka!"

Yuna: "The game!"

Lulu: "Oh!"

[Lulu does some magic and starts moving the ship back (?). Meanwhile,
Wakka and his team are on the last stretch of the game with only a
handful of seconds left.]

Bobba: "Thirty seconds left! The Aurochs are launching an all-out
       offensive! A long pass from Letty! It goes through! He shoots!
       Gooooooal! Unbelievable! The Aurochs win the match, 3-2!"

[The party sees the action on the dock sphere monitor.]

Tidus: "We won!"

Yuna: "We did it! We're in the finals!"

Lulu: "Not the most...graceful win. If it was Chappu, he'd still be
      standing."

Tidus: "Hey, aren't you being just a little unfair?"

Lulu: "Excuse me?"

Tidus: "I know I could never take Chappu's place. You're the one who
       told Wakka that, right, Lulu? And I don't think Wakka would
       ever try to take Chappu's pl--"

Lulu: "You don't want to finish that sentence."

[Everyone heads to the locker room. Wakka's pretty beat up.]

Datto: "Sure you're all right, Cap'n?"

Letty: "The game starts in a few minutes. You sure you okay?"

Jassu: "We're playing the Goers, too."

[Tidus and company walk in.]

Tidus: "Miss me?"

Datto: "Lady Yuna!"

Letty: "Are you okay?"

Yuna: "All this because of me. I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!"

Wakka: "How can you let some Al Bhed kidnap you?"

Tidus: "Hey, let it go, all right?"

Wakka: "Don't go near Al Bhed anymore, okay? They're trouble.

[Kimahri and Yuna leave sometime later. Tidus goes to Wakka.]

Wakka: "The game's starts soon. No time for warm-ups. Ready?"

Tidus: "Lemme at 'em."

Wakka: "All right! I got something to tell you boys. After this
       game...I'm retiring. I promised myself this would be my last
       tournament. Win or lose, I'm quitting blitzball. But you
       know... Since we're here, we might as well win!"

Aurochs: "Yeah!"

Botta: "A-Am I on the bench?"

Wakka: "I'm warming the bench. He's taking my place. All right, boys,
       let's win this one! Let's make the Goers goners!"

Tidus: "Let's blitz!

[The Aurochs and Tidus go out into the hallway.]

Lulu: "I saw you there, floating on the sphere."

Wakka: "Hey, you weren't supposed to see that."

Lulu: "You really gave it your all, didn't you?"

[In the hallway:]

Tidus: "All right, boys, what're we gonna do?"

Aurochs: "Win!"

Botta: "For Cap'n Wakka!

[They go out to the arena; the two in the locker room watch a sphere.]

Bobba: "This is it, folks! In just a few minutes, the championship
       game!"

[On the wall, is writing:]

"My best memories are here.
 Wakka, Captain of the Aurochs."

[The view changes to the bleachers.]

Bobba: "But who could have imagined... A championship game between
       these two teams? Our legendary Luca Goers against...the
       horrendously ill-fated Besaid Aurochs!"

[From a stairwell, Auron emerges.]

Jimma: "This looks like history in the making, Bobba."

[The Aurochs and the Goers meet in the sphere pool. Bickson extends
a handshake but pulls it away at the last second, trying to punch
him instead.]

Bobba: "They're already going at it, folks! The Goers are taunting
       the Aurochs!

[The game starts and Bickson kicks one in.]

Bobba: "What a great play! The Goers score first!"

[Both teams play pretty good.]

Bobba: "And it's halftime!"

Jimma: "The Goers are just playing great, Bobba. Really great."

[Back in the locker room:]

Wakka: "Zone defense, boys! Stop those Goers!"

Aurochs: "Cap'n!"

Tidus: "What about me?"

Wakka: "Get the ball and just shoot like crazy!"

Datto: "Goers are goin' down!"

Aurochs: "Yeah!"

Tidus: "Shoot like crazy!"

Aurochs: "Yeah!"

Wakka: "All right! Hustle!

[The second half begins, but soon...]

Bobba: "The fans are getting impatient! They're calling for some
       action! Everyone seems to be calling for Wakka, folks! Say...
       Where is that player going? He's leaving the sphere pool! He
       may be injured!

[Tidus meets Wakka in the locker room, and they switch places in the
middle of the game.]

Tidus: "To be honest, I did feel kind of let out, but... It really
       was the Aurochs' and Wakka's show, after all."

Bobba: "I wonder what's happening? The crowd is going wild!"

[Wakka swims in.]

Bobba: "Ah! It's Wakka! He's back on the field and ready to go! The
       Aurochs seem glad to have him back.

[If they lose the game:]

Bobba: "The Aurochs may have lost the game, but what a way to go!"

[If they win the game:]

Bobba: "Unbelievable! The Aurochs win, folks! This is one for the
       record books!"

[Tidus swims into the sphere pool to see Wakka, but a bunch of
Sahagin Chiefs swim in and attack. They defeat them, but the stadium
is in chaos now. In the stands:]

Lulu: "What's happening?"

[FMV. Auron appears with a gigantic sword, and faces off against a
large dragon-like monster, which he kills in battle. Tidus and Wakka
run out to meet him.]

Tidus: "Auron!"
Wakka: "Sir Auron!"

Tidus: "So, you do know him."

Wakka: "Yeah. Best guardian there ever was."

[The three of them kill a Garuda, but soon become surrounded by
monsters.]

Tidus: "Hey, gimme a break!"

[In the stands, Seymour summons an evil-looking aeon. FMV. That aeon
starts shooting beams from its one eye and kills the monsters that
are flying and walking around. Later on, in the city square, the
Aurochs meet up.]

Datto: "You're really leavin', Cap'n?"

Letty: "Shouldn't you heal up first?"

Wakka: "Yuna needs me with her now. I can't be lying around in some
       bed."

Datto: "Yeah, but..."

Wakka: "Come on, look sharp! The blitz season just started! Don't
       make those faces, ya? Well... See you, boys! You be good!"

Aurochs: "Cap'n..."

Wakka: "I can't hear you!"

Aurochs: "Cap'n!"

[Later, the party (sans Tidus) gathers near the town outskirts.]

Yuna: "Are you sure?"

Wakka: "Never liked long goodbyes anwyay. Sorry for making you wait,
       Yuna. I had some promises to keep, ya? From now on, I'll be
       your full-time guardian."

Yuna: "Then welcome back, Sir Wakka. Good to have you with us."

Wakka: "Hey, it's good to be back, ya? So, any news on what happened?"

Lulu: "Not really. We don't know where the fiends came from. Maester Mika
      is safe, thanks to Maester Seymour. That's about it."

Yuna: "Maester Seymour's aeon... It was so powerful."

[Tidus and Auron are down at the docks, the former about ready to start
a fight with the man who brought him to Spira.]

Tidus: "Hey, you! Don't just stand there! All of this is your fault!
       Gettin' swallowed by Sin! Not being able to go back to Zanarkand
       -- everything, everything! I'm telling you, it's all your fault!"

[Auron just laughs.]

Tidus: "Who are you, anyway? You knew my old man, didn't you?"

Auron: "Yeah."

Tidus: "And you also knew Yuna's father."

Auron: "That's correct."

Tidus: "Hey, man, there's no way! That's just impossible!"

Auron: "Nothing impossible about it. Jecht, Braska, and I...
       Together we defeated Sin ten years ago. Then I went
       to Zanarkand...where I watched over you. So that one day
       I could bring you to Spira."

Tidus: "Why did it have to be me?"

Auron: "Jecht asked me to."

Tidus: "Is he alive?"

Auron: "It depends on what you mean by 'alive.' He is no longer human.
       But then... I felt something of Jecht there in that shell,
       couldn't you? You must have felt him when you came in contact
       with Sin."

Tidus: "It can't be..."

Auron: "It is. Sin is Jecht."

Tidus: "No! That's ridiculous! No way! I don't believe you!"

Auron: "But it is the truth. You'll see for yourself. Come with me."

Tidus: "If I say no?"

Auron: "Every story must have an ending."

Tidus: "I don't care about your stories!"

Auron: "I see. Sorry you feel that way. Fine, then. Come or don't
       come. It's your decision."

Tidus: "What am I supposed to say? You tell me it's my decision... But
       I don't have a choice, do I? You're the only one who can tell
       me what's going on, anyways! I have to go with you! I have to!"

Auron: "Irritating, I know. Or are you afraid? It's all right."

Tidus: "Auron? Will I ever go home? Back to Zanarkand?"

Auron: "That's up to Jecht. I'm going to offer my services to Yuna.
       Come."

[The two start walking to the outskirts. The rest of the party is
already there.]

Wakka: "Do you think he's gonna stay here?"

Lulu: "Sir Auron knows him, apparently. You were right. He did meet
      someone he knew."

Yuna: "Do you think he'll find a way back to Zanarkand?"

Wakka: "In any case, I'll miss having him around."

Yuna: "He's still in town, isn't he? I think I'll go see him... Oh!"

[Auron is approaching, with Tidus in tow.]

Wakka: "Whoa."

Yuna: "Sir Auron?"

Auron: "Yuna."

Yuna: "Sir?"

Auron: "I wish to become your guardian. Do you accept?"

Wakka: "You serious?"

Auron: "You refuse?"

Yuna: "No, no! We accept! Right, everyone?"

Wakka: "O-Of course! No problem at all!"

Lulu: "But...why?"

Auron: "I promised Braska."

Yuna: "You promised my father? Thank you, Sir Auron! You're welcome
      to join us!"

Auron: "And...he comes too."

Tidus: "Hi...guys. Eh...howdy!"

Auron: "This one I promised Jecht."

Yuna: "Is Sir Jecht alive?"

Auron: "Can't say. Haven't seen him in ten years."

Yuna: "I...see."

Auron: "You'll meet eventually."

Yuna: "Yes, I'm looking forward to it!"

[Auron walks to Lulu.]

Auron: "What's our itinerary? Where are we headed?"

Yuna: "Hey come with me!"

[Tidus walks to Yuna.]

Yuna: "Hey, watch!"

[Yuna does 'the whistle.']

Tidus: "Hey, you got pretty good."

Yuna: "You sound sad."

Tidus: "Yeah, maybe."

Yuna: "Wanna scream?"

Tidus: "I really don't think that's gonna help this time."

Yuna: "You know what? It's embarrassing to say this myself... But
      summoners and their guardians are kind of like Spira's ray of
      light. A lot of people in Spira depend on us. I learned to
      practice smiling when I'm sad, you know? I know it's hard."

Tidus: "Yeah... I understand. I think."

Yuna: "Right, now let's see what you can do!"

Tidus: "Huh?"

Yuna: "Come on!"

[Tidus tries to make himself smile.]

Tidus: "This is weird!"

Yuna: "Next, try laughing out loud!"

Tidus: "What?"

Yuna: "Come on, show me!"

[Tidus belts out laughing and keeps laughing.]

Yuna: "You probably shouldn't laugh anymore."

[They both start laughing.]

Yuna: "Too funny!"

Tidus: "It was your idea!"

Yuna: "Um...thank you. I want my journey to be full of laughter."

Tidus: "Okay."

Yuna: "If we should get separated, just whistle. I'll come running.
      I promise."

Tidus: "Well, let's go."

[Tidus turns to Wakka.]

Tidus: "What're you looking at?"

Wakka: "We were just worried you guys might've gone crazy!"

Yuna: Sorry! Well then, alright. Now, we will go to the temple of
      Djose. And guardians? Don't forget to smile!"

[They head up and out of Luca.]

[At the nearest save sphere:]

Narrative: [Traveller's Save Sphere Level 2]

           Thanks to the Besaid Aurochs' achievements, Save Spheres
           are now able to teleport you to the blitzball stadium!

           [The Blitzball Scout System]

           Many denizens of Spira are avid blitzball players! Talk to
           them with ([]) to scout them! Sign the best players in
           Spira and lead the Besaid Aurochs to victory!

[The party is soon attacked by a stocky, armored monster.]

Tidus: "Hah! That one looks slow."

Auron: "It's also tough. Let me handle this."

Tidus: "No way! I can take it."

[His attack doesn't do much.]

Tidus: "What the...?"

[Auron kills it.]

Wakka: "Told ya, Sir Auron's the best."

Tidus: "Hmph, I could've done that."

[A ways down the road, a scholarly man stops the party.]

Man: "Do you know what those ruins are from?"

Tidus: "Some old city?"

Man: "A city most ancient! A terrible testament to Sin's power. I
     tremble every time I see them. Compared to Sin, humans are mere
     mudpuppies!"

Yuna: "But I believe humans are the only ones capable of defeating
      Sin."

Man: "A good reply. I am relieved to hear you say that, m'lady
     summoner. Where are my manners? I am Maechen, a scholar. At
     your service, m'lady. I am on a journey, studying the history
     of our world, Spira, seeking its stories and secrets... My
     travels have taken me to many places, and I am troubled by what
     I have seen. Fragile smiles on people's faces crumbling at the
     mere mention of Sin. They are counting on you, m'lady. Give them
     a reason to rejoice once more."

Yuna: "I will."

[Over the hill, some chocobos soon come.]

Woman: "Lady Summoner, I presume?"

Yuna: "Yes, I am Yuna."

Lucil: "I am Lucil, captain of the Djose Chocobo Knights."

Elma: "And I'm Elma. We've been charged to guard the Highroad."

Lucil: "There have been reports of a large fiend appearing in this
       area, with a taste for chocobos. Do take care, Summoner Yuna,
       if you are to rent any chocobos."

Yuna: "Thank you. We will be careful."

Lucil: "Good. We should get back to our rounds. Farewell."

Elma: "Our prayers are with you."

[The chocobo knights leave.]

Tidus: "A large fiend... Let's go get him!"

Auron: "Why?"

Tidus: "It's the right thing to do."

Auron: "It's the right thing to do?"

Tidus: "What'd I say now?"

Auron: "Jecht said that a lot, too. And every time he said it, it
       meant trouble for Braska and me."

[They head into the second screen and see a woman and a child.]

Woman: "My Lady Summoner!"

Girl: "You're a summoner?"

Yuna: "Yes. My name is Yuna."

Girl: "I'm Calli."

Yuna: "Nice to meet you, Calli."

Calli: "Lady Yuna, are you going to bring us the Calm?"

Yuna: "Yes, very soon."

Calli: "Yay!"

Woman: "We're looking forward to another Calm, My Lady Summoner."

Yuna: "I'll do my best."

Woman: "And good luck to your guardians as well."

[Calli and her mom walk away.]

Tidus: "What's the calm?"

Lulu: "The Calm is a time of peace. It comes after a summoner defeats
      Sin, and lasts until Sin reappears."

Yuna: "Sin dies and is reborn."

Tidus: "I get it! I thought it was weird. Yuna's dad defeates Sin ten
       years ago, right? But Sin's still here! Didn't make much sense
       till now. Wait... If it just comes back..."

Yuna: "Don't say it isn't worth it... Because it is."

T-Narrative: Even for a little while...people can sleep in their beds
             without being afraid. That kind of time is worth
             anything. Don't say it isn't worth it. Your words that
             day, Yuna -- I remember them well.

[The party heads down the road until they find a rest stop.]

Auron: "We rest here."

Wakka: "But, this is an Al Bhed shop!"

Auron: "Is that a problem?"

Wakka: "They don't believe in Yevon, and in Luca they... They
       kidnapped Yuna!"

Auron: "Where were her guardians?"

Yuna: "Sir Auron's just concerned about your health."

Wakka: "I'm not tired one bit!"

Auron: "Well I am."

[The party rests in the shop.]

Tidus; "As if I could sleep!"

[Tidus walks outside.]

Tidus: "Check it out!"

[The sun is setting behind an ancient piece of ruins at sea.]

T-Narrative: That sunset was different from the one I saw in Kilika.
             It was quiet -- almost gentle."

[Tidus walks over to Yuna, who's sitting on the hillside.]

Tidus: "Whatcha up to?"

Yuna: "Pretty..."

Tidus: "Sure is."

Yuna: "I wish I could live in a place like this. Peaceful... Living
      with a smile on my face every day."

Tidus: "You can, once you beat Sin, right?"

Yuna: "But then a new Sin will be born anyway."

Tidus: "Well then, you can just beat it again."

Yuna: "I wish I could."

Tidus: "Hey, you can! Trust me! You are the best summoner out there!
       Yuna, why does Sin always come back?"

Yuna: "Sin is our punishment for our vanity. And it will not go away
      until we've atoned."

Tidus: "How do we do that? What did we do that was so bad in the
       first place? Was it using lots of machina or something? Oh...
       Wait, was that such a bad thing, really?"

Yuna: "It's funny... Ever since I was young, I never questioned it.
      But now that you ask me if it is that bad or not...I don't know.
      There are so many things I don't know."

Tidus: "Well then, we're the same! Such thinking is very unbecoming
       of a summoner! Sound like Mika?"

[They both laugh.]

Yuna: "That's not very nice, you know!

Tidus: "You know... During a game, you have to think of blitz and
       nothing else, you know?"

Yuna: "Okay."

Tidus: "You can't think, 'That's a cute girl in the fifth seat from
       the right.' And you can't be thinking about where you're going
       on that date, because the minute you do, that's when you lose!
       You see, uh, Yuna, what I mean is, you shouldn't worry, you
       know? After we beat Sin, that's when you can worry about the
       future."

Yuna: "I guess."

Tidus: "But, Yuna, how are you supposed to beat something big like
       that?"

Yuna: "The Final Summoning. It's the only way to defeat Sin. The
      only way. With it, we can call the Final Aeon. That's the goal
      of the pilgrimage. The Fayth of the Final Summoning lies waiting
      in the far north, to greet summoners that complete their
      pilgrimage. At the world's edge...in Zanarkand."

Tidus: "In Zanarkand?"

Auron: "She means the ruins of a city destroyed a thousand years ago."

[Auron is leaning on a road marker, listening in.]

Tidus: "You sure it's ruins?"

Yuna: "That's what I've heard."

Auron: "You'll see it for yourself soon enough. Yuna, come back
       inside."

[Auron walks away.]

Yuna: "You will go with us...to Zanarkand?"

Tidus: "Yeah, I'll go. I'll go to Zanarkand to see it with my own
       eyes."

T-Narrative: I knew it couldn't be my Zanarkand. But I had to make
             sure.

[The next morning, a man runs over.]

Man: "You're a guardian, right? I think this'll help." [Obtain: Lv. 1 Key
     Sphere] "The sphere monitor will teach you how to use it. Have you read
     the instructions yet?"
     R1 --> Yes
     R2 --> No

     R1: "Then you should be okay."

     R2: "In that case, you should view the sphere monitor over there and
         find out how to use it."

[Tidus starts to leave, but bumps into a man coming in.]

Man: "Byntuh sa."

Tidus: "Sorry."

Man: "Ah, forgive me, sir. I meant to say 'pardon me,' but it came out in Al
     Bhed."

Tidus: "Oh, you're an Al Bhed?"

Rin: "I am Rin, the owner of this establishment. Hela du saad oui. It means,
     'nice to meet you.'"

Tidus: "Well helly doo sad wee to you, too."

Rin: "If you are interested... Al Bhed primers can be found all over Spira.
     Finding them and learning our language might be fun. Here, let me give
     you one in commemoration of our meeting. Although you might want to be
     careful where you speak our language." [Obtain: Al Bhed Primer vol. VIII]

Tidus: "Yeah, I hear Al Bhed aren't liked much. Oh, sorry!"

Rin: "Ed ec y cRysa."

Woman's Voice: "Someone, help! The chocobos!"

Auron: "That's our cue, let's go."

Rin: "Thank you for your help. Please, use this." [Obtain: Mega-Potion x 2]

[Tidus runs outside.]

Lulu: "To the chocobo corral!

[Around the side of the travel agency, chocobos scatter as a large monster
atop the structure grabs a chocobo and squeezes it. It attacks and pushes
the party toward the cliff edge.]

Auron: "So, we're to be pushed off a cliff."

Auron: "Attack now! Push it back!"

[If you fight it and get pushed off the cliff, you'll land on the Mi'ihen
Oldroad -- an adjacent lower path.:]

Auron: "Now I know I can count on you."
Tidus: "Gimme a break. I just woke up. Like you did much!"
Auron: "It was your idea to fight that thing. If you're always so groggy,
       just stay awake."
Tidus: "Yeah right, thanks for the tip."

[If you fight it and beat it:]

Rin: "Have you any interest in renting some chocobos? As a token of our
     gratitude, the first time is free of charge. Please ask the attendant,
     if you wish to rent."

Attendant: "Thank you so much for saving the chocobos!"

[Down the road, the cart Luzzu and Gatta were carrying is going through the
entrance to Mushroom Rock Road. A Crusader stands with them.]

Gatta: "Gatta and Luzzu reporting, sir!"

Luzzu: "This is the last of them."

Crusader: "Good to have you with us. Go on through!"

[Gatta sees Tidus.]

Gatta: "Show me how to play blitz sometime!"

Luzzu: "Wait around. We'll have Sin beaten in no time!"

[Tidus tries to follow after them.]

Crusader: "I'm sorry, I can't let you pass. Hey, you're a summoner and
          her guardians, right? Sorry for the inconvenience."
          R1 --> Don't worry about it.
          R2 --> Tell me about the operation.

          R1: "Thank you for your cooperation!"
          R2: "What, they didn't tell you? We're bringing sinspawn from all
              over Spira here. Sinspawn inevitably draw Sin, right? We're
              going to lure it into a trap!"

[Seymour and his guardians come down the road.]

Seymour: "So we meet again, Lady Yuna."

Yuna: "Y-Yes?"

Seymour: "You look troubled. Is there anything I can do?"

Yuna: "Well..."

[She looks at the Crusaders blocking the road.]

Seymour: "I see."

Crusader: "Maester Seymour. Let me show you to the command center."

Seymour: "Hold. I have a request."

Crusader: "Yes, Your Grace?"

Seymour: I need to have Summoner Yuna and her guardians let through to
         the command center."

Crusader: "But, Maester Seymour, sir."

Seymour: "Do not worry. I will take full responsibility."

Crusader: "Very well. They may pass."

Seymour: "It is done."

Yuna: "Thank you, Your Grace."

[Seymour and his entourage walk through.]

Lulu: "Yuna, it's time to go."

Yuna: "Oh! Right!"

[Yuna and Lulu start walking.]

Tidus: "Who does he think he is?"

Wakka: "He's a maester. Better get used to it, ya?"

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

[The party enters the location.]

Crusader: "All hail Maester Seymour!"

Seymour: "Brave Crusaders of Spira, protectors of all Spira. Believe in the
         path you have chosen, let faith be your strength! I, Seymour Guado,
         maester of Yevon, will bear witness to your deeds today."

Crusaders: "Sir!"

[In their only little group:]

Wakka: "What's goin' on? Why's Maester Seymour backing the Crusaders, eh?
       They're using the Al Bhed's machina! They're violating the teachings!"

Yuna: "Even going against the teachings they're willing to risk it for the
      greater good. Wakka, I think Maester SEymour sees that, too."

Wakka: "Lulu?"

Lulu: "Hmm... I can only speculate."

Auron: "Ask him yourself."

[Seymour walks over.]

Seymour: "Ah, Sir Auron. It is an honor. I would be most interested in hearing
         what you've been doing these past ten years."

Auron: "I've got nothing to say about it."

[He walks away.]

Seymour: "I...see. Sir Auron must be a great asset as a guardian."

Yuna: "Your Grace!"

Seymour: "Please, there's no need for formalities."

Wakka: "Excuse me... Maester Seymour? Why is your Lordship...presently...
       present here...sir?"

Seymour: "Plase, speak as you normally would."

Wakka: "Isn't this operation against the teachings of Yevon? Aren't you gonna
       stop them?"

Seymour: "It's true... I should. However... Both the Crusaders and the Al Bhed
         truly wish peace for Spira. This Operation Mi'ihen was born from that
         wish they share. Although it may be sacrilege to Yevon, their
         intentions are pure. And I, Seymour Guado -- the person, not the
         maester of Yevon... As a denizen of Spira, I wish them well in their
         endeavor."

Wakka: "But, using machina... That's bad, isn't it?"

Seymour: "Pretend you didn't see them."

Wakka: "Beg your pardon, but that's not something a maester should say!"

Seymour: "Then, pretend I didn't say it."

Wakka: "You're kidding!"

[Seymour walks away.]

T-Narrative: From the first time I laid eyes on him, I never did like
             Seymour... But you know, some of the things he said that day...
             They made a lot of sense to me.

[Clasko approaches after a while.]

Clasko: "Excuse me, Lady Summoner Yuna?"

Yuna: "Yes?"

Clasko: "The command center... Maester Seymour requests your presence there,
        ma'am."

Yuna: "Thank you."

Clasko: "Take that road to the command center. It's not far. We're still in
        the midst of preparations this way. Sorry."

[They take a lift up to the top ledge. There is a lot of machina cannons.]

Wakka: "Curse these...!"

[He kicks one.]

Tidus: "He really hates them, huh?"

Lulu: "Chappu... He left the sword Wakka gave him in Besaid. And he fought
      with an Al Bhed machina weapon instead."

Wakka: "That's got nothing to do with it! I just hate these sacrilegious
       contraptions!

[From the ledge, the party can see the beach buzzing with activity. Crusaders
coax sinspawn from cages into one larger cage, until it's packed.]

Wakka: "It won't work anyway."

Yuna: "Don't say that. It might be a hopeless campaign, and it might mean
      defying Yevon... But the Crusaders and the Al Bhed -- they're doing
      their best to defeat Sin. They want to rid Spira of Sin forever. And
      that's just what we want, too, isn't it? Isn't it?"

Wakka: "Hmph! All right, all right! But I still think machina are bad news!
       They're forbidden for a reason!"

Lucil: "Lady Summoner! There you are!"

[Lucil comes over.]

Lucil: "The command center is that way. Maester Kinoc is also there."

Yuna: "Maester Kinoc, too?"

Lucil: "Yes. Please hurry, my lady."

[They head to the command center. Gatta is there.]

Gatta: "The operation will begin shortly. Please check all your equipment."

Wakka: "Um, you all right?"

Gatta: "Of course not! I came here to fight Sin! But they stick me here!"

Auron: "If you want to prove yourself..."

Gatta: "Huh?"

Auron: "First you must complete the tasks you are given."

[The party heads into the command center. Maester Kinoc gets up to meet them,
or, more particularly, Auron, whom he tries to hug.]

Kinoc: "I'd heard from Seymour, but I didn't know if we'd actually meet. Good
       to see you, Auron! Ten yaers, is it?"

[Lulu bends to Tidus' ear.]

Lulu: "That's Wen Kinoc, one of the Four Maesters of Yevon. He leads the
      warrior monks and also commands the Crusaders."

Gatta: "All troops ready to move at your command, sir!"

Kinoc: "Good. Dismissed."

Gatta: "Sir!"

[Gatta leaves.]

Kinoc: "Tell me, Auron. Where have you been the last ten years?"

Auron: "We don't have time for this now, do we?"

Kinoc: "This plan won't work, you know that. We'll just let them dream a
       little longer."

Tidus: "What?"

Seymour: "Lord Kinoc..."

[Seymour appears.]

Kinoc: "Oh, yes. Proceed."

Auron: "That Kinoc, a maester?

Kinoc: "I heard that, Auron. A lot has happened in the last ten years. What
       were you doing, and where?"

Auron: "Fulfilling a promise I made to a friend. I still am."

Kinoc: "Just tell me one thing: Have you seen Zanarkand?"

[Auron harrumphs and doesn't reply.]

Yuna: "I kinda...think we don't belong here."

Guard: "It is time at last. We must tell the Al Bhed waiting outside to begin
       the operation at once. The fiends may break through. This place is not
       safe. Make sure you're prepared to defend yourselves. Tell me when
       you're ready."

[The party tells him when they're ready.]

Guard: "Maester Kinoc. Please."

[Kinoc walks out on a jutting ledge to give the go-ahead signal.]

Yuna: "Will Sin come?"

Guard: "Sin always returns for its spawn. To make sure, we're going to
       encourage them to call out to it."

Auron: "You won't have to. It'll come."

T-Narrative: I remembered Auron telling me. Sin is my old man. Sin is Jecht."

[The cage holding the sinspawn is electrocute to coerce them into calling for
Sin. Unfortunately, it breaks wide open and a large monster attacks the party.

That, I can hit!"

[They defeat the monster. FMV. Sin appears in the bay.]

Lucil: "Let's go!"

Cannoneer: "Fire!"

[Cannonfire peppers Sin, cracking sinspawn off of it. Some swim towards the
shore, as Lucil gives the advancement order.]

Lucil: "Charge!"

[High above, at the command center...]

Auron: "Look out!"

[The party scatters on his word. FMV. Sin creates a giant barrier over itself
and shoots it towards the beach, disintigrating the Crusaders and sinspawn
that are fighting. The battle ends before it's even really begun. Meanwhile,
Yuna wakes up to find the monster from before getting a second wind. Auron
walks to help Seymour as he tries to fight it off himself; Yuna follows. No
one else is conscious yet.]

Seymour: "Stand back, Lady Yuna."

Yuna: "Y-Yes."

[They defeat the monster, for real this time.]

Yuna: "The others?"

[FMV. The Al Bhed machina offshore fires a large pulse beam at Sin, pushing
its shield back.  They amp up the power, but Sin shoots a blast through the
barrier and destroys the structure that was the last hope for battle. Tidus
wakes up down at the beach. Gatta is still alive, but...]

Gatta: "What's...going on? Why? What? What's going on!?"

[FMV. Sin leaves.]

Tidus: "Don't you run away from me!"

[Tidus runs to the shore; up on the ridge, Yuna is watching the aftermath.]

Yuna: "Everyone, stand back! I'll summon!"

Seymour: "You won't hurt it. Your powers are still...too weak."

Yuna: "But I must do something!

Seymour: "You can't!"

[Meanwhile, Tidus is swimming after Sin but isn't making any progress.]

T-Narrative: "I have no idea what I was thinking when I ran after Sin that day.
             But before I knew what I was doing, there I was chasing him down
             like a thief at market. Maybe I was angry. Maybe I wanted to go
             home. I kept thinking of Zanarkand, and my old man.

[The player sees a part of the Farplane (?), with the newly-dead Crusaders
still running around like they were in battle. Luzzu or Gatta -- whichever one
died based on your decision -- will be there, forlorn. The Strange Boy who
appeared at the beginning of the game and a few other time will be there, too,
shaking his head. A flash of light later, and a young Tidus is on the
houseboat.]

Jecht: "What?"

Tidus: "They say you don't practice anymore, that you're gonna retire."

Jecht: "Let them talk. I'm still the best."

Tidus: "They say you're no good 'cause you drink all the time."

Jecht: "I can quit drinkin' whenever I want!"

Tidus: "Then do it now."

Jecht: "What did you say?"

Tidus: "You just said you can!"

Jecht: "Heh. Tomorrow, maybe."

Tidus: "Why not today?"

Jecht: "Why do today what you can leave for tomorrow? There he goes again...
       crying!"

[The flashback ends. On a whited-out screen:]

T-Narrative: I thought I sensed my old man there. Somewhere... Or maybe it was
             just Sin's toxin playing tricks on my mind.

[Tidus wakes up again on the beach.]

T-Narrative: How many died today? People die, and Yuna dances. When will she
             stop dancing? When will it stop? Yuna won't stop dancing -- not
             until Sin is gone. Those were my thoughts then...I think.

Auron: "I see you're still here."

Tidus: "Huh?"

Auron: "Many stories ended here today... But... Yours goes on, I see."

Tidus: "What?"

T-Narrative: Sin had come and gone, but I remained here.

[Auron speaks Kinoc and Seymour with some warrior monks.]

Auron: "A swift retreat. Satisfied?"

Kinoc: "What do you mean?"

Auron: "Those who turned from Yevon died, while the faithful live on."

Kinoc: "The past ten years have changed you, I see."

[Seymour goes over to Yuna as Kinoc and Auron part ways.]

Seymour: "You do not look so well. But now, more than ever, you must be the
         people's strength, their confidence. Anyone else would be expected to
         show their sorrow. But you...are a summoner. You are Spira's hope.
         Until Sin is defeated, you must not relent. Do you understand?"

Yuna: "Yes. I understand."

Seymour: "Are you afraid? Yuna, take me as your pillar of strength. As
         Yunalesca had her lord Zaon. Lady Yuna. Until next we meet, farewell."

[Seymour leaves, and the party soon follows. As the party walks, Tidus and
Kimahri straggle a bit.]

Yuna: "Hey, you two! Hurry up!"

Tidus: "She's awfully cheerful."

Kimahri: "In dark times she must be. She must shine bright. Now are dark
         times. Yuna tries hard."

Tidus: "We should help her, then."

Kimahri: "If we worry, she tries harder. Do not frown."

Tidus: "Don't worry, be happy?"

Kimahri: "Kimahri try, too."

Tidus: "Smile! Let me see."

[Kimahri 'smiles' menancingly...not on purpose, of course. They soon come
to a crossroads.]

Tidus: "Hey! How much longer till Zanarkand?"

Wakka: "Still a ways."

Lulu: "First down the Moonflow to the Guado city of Guadosalam... Then we
      cross the Thunder Plains to the temple of Macalania."

Tidus: "Oh, boy."

Yuna: "And before that, we get to pray at the temple in Djose!"

Tidus: "We can't just skip all that? Can we, huh?"

Yuna: "I have to pray to the fayth in every temple in order to earn the Final
      Aeon."

Wakka: "That's a summoner's training. She's gotta prepare mind and body, all
       just to get ready for the Final Summoning."

Tidus: "Must be tough, Yuna."

Yuna: "I'll be fine with you here!"

[The party heads on; Auron lingers with Tidus.]

Auron: "Hey, new guy."

Tidus: "Uh...me?"

Auron: "Who else?"

Tidus: "What can I do for you, boss?"

Auron: "Don't tell Yuna you know about Sin and Jecht. You know her... She
       would...distance herself from you. We do not want that."

Tidus: "I see, I think. Yeah, but even if I did say something, no one would
       believe me, you know?"

Auron: "Yuna would."

Tidus: "Ah...you have a point. Come to think of it...did I really have to know
       about Jecht? What about my feelings?"

Auron: "Better than you finding out at a critical moment, becoming emotional."

Tidus: "What? Me, emotional?"

[Auron walks off.]

Auron: "I heard you were quite the crybaby."

T-Narrative: Yeah, maybe when I was a kid. Maybe even a little now. Just a
             little."

Tidus: "Hey! I still don't buy your story, you hear?"

| 12) Temple of Yevon-Djose                                     TYVD |
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

[Tidus enters the path to the temple.]

Lucil: "Yuna, it is good to see you and your companions are well."

Yuna: "Yourselves as well, Captain. We were worried. Praise be to Yevon!"

Lucil: "We escaped with our lives, but our troops were decimated."

Elma: "Of all our chocobos, only this one made it."

Clasko: "We make pretty poor Chocobo Mountained Forces without chocobos."

Lucil: "We turned our backs on the teachings and cast away our faith. This...
       this is our just reward.

[The party walks to the temple.]

Tidus: "Is that the Djose temple?"

[The rock surrounding the structure blows apart, but floats in place due to
heavy electricity. Inside is a large temple, much larger than it looked
before.]

Tidus: "Awesome!"

Lulu: "The Lightning Mushroom Rock. It only opens when a summoner is addressing
      the fayth."

Wakka: "That means another summoner's already in there."

Yuna: "Another summoner?"

Tidus: "What if it's Dona?"

Yuna: "We have to hurry."

Tidus: "Right! In we go!"

[They walk in, just in time to see a summoner returning from the fayth. It's
a man, though; not Dona. Two guardians -- a man and a kid -- are with him.]

Summoner: "I beg your pardon, but may I ask your name?"

Yuna: "I am Summoner Yuna, from the Isle of Besaid."

Summoner: "As I thought! The daughter of Lord Braska. You have the look of
          your father."

Yuna: "My father? You knew him."

Summoner: "No, I have never met the man. Ah, my apologies. I am Isaaru. I am
          a summoner, like you."

Pacce: "I'm Pacce. Pleased to meet you."

Maroda: "And I'm Maroda. I'm guarding my big brother here."

Isaaru: "Since I was a child, I've always looked up to Lord Braska. I wished
        I would someday become a high summoner like he was. You must have some
        of your father's talent in you! I believe you might someday defeat
        Sin."

Yuna: "I...I'm not really... I've only just become a summoner."

Isaaru: "Of course, I've no intention of losing, either. So perhaps we should
        race to see who can defeat Sin first, no?"

Yuna: "Very well, then. I accept your challenge."

Maroda: "Isaaru!"

Isaaru: "Yuna, I beg your leave. Good luck, to both of us!"

Yuna: "Yes."

[The party walks into the Cloister. Tidus follows, but Isaaru calls out.]

Isaaru: "Hey, you."

Tidus: "Me?"

Isaaru: "You are Yuna's guardian, no? Maroda's heard a curious rumor. I thought
        you should know."

Maroda: "I heard it from those Crusaders. Seems that summoners have been going
        out on pilgrimage and just...disappearing."

Isaaru: "It could just be the fiends got them...but not so many so quickly."

Maroda: "Sorry I don't know more, but...watch your back. Ain't much future for
        a guardian without a summoner, eh?"

Pacce: "What? What? Whatcha all talkin' 'bout?"

Maroda: "We're talking about doing your job as a guardian!"

Pacce: "Hey, I'm doing good! Right, big brother?"

[Isaaru nods.]

Isaaru: "Please, be careful."

Tidus: "Will do!"

Isaaru: "Pacce!"

Pacce: "Oh... What?"

Isaaru: "We're leaving!"

Pacce: "Be right there! See ya!"

[Tidus runs up to the Cloister.]

Monk: "The Cloister of Trials lies within. Are you prepared? [Y/N]

[Tidus runs to his fellow teammates.]

Wakka: "All right! Guardians, at attention!"

Yuna: "We are ready."

Wakka: "All right... Let's do it!"

[They go through the trials to the antechamber. Yuna goes into the fayth; just
then, Dona and Barthello enter.]

Dona: "Well, well. You again. Still travelling with quite the crowd, I see.

[Barthello walks over to Auron.]

Dona: "What is it, Barthello? You know this riffraff?"

Barthello: "You are...Auron, no?"

Auron: "What of it?"

Barthello: "Can...I shake your hand? Auron--no, Sir Auron. You're the reason I
           became a guardian!"

[Auron chuckles and shakes his hand.]

Barthello: "Thank you, sir! This means so much to me!"

Wakka: "Calling the personal guardian of Lord Braska riffraff?"

Lulu: "And you call yourself a summoner?"

Dona: "Barthello, enough! Get back here!"

Tidus: "Hang in there, buddy, eh?"

[Yuna comes out after awhile.]

Dona: "You owe much to your father. All these guardians...and Sir Auron, too?
      And I hear Maester Seymour's quite taken with you. The world must look
      different when you're the daughter of Lord Braska."

Yuna: "This has nothing to do with my father! I am travelling on my own, as a
      full-fledged summoner!"

Dona: "Oh, is that so? Then try standing on your own two legs for once. Your
      guardians won't be able to protect you when the time comes."

[Dona enters the fayth and the party rests. The new aeon is called Ixion. Tidus
goes into the nuns' chambers the next morning and finds Yuna sleeping; everyone
is waiting around for her.]

Nun: "She was working until dawn. Healing the wounded, sending the fallen."

Tidus: "Okay... I guess I'll just let her sleep for now, then."

[Yuna wakes up.]

Tidus: "Morning!"

Yuna: "What? Morning?"

Tidus: "Don't worry!"

Yuna: "But it's morning! I'm so sorry! I-I'll get ready right away! Just a
      moment!"

Tidus: "Don't worry! It's okay!"

[Back outside, Yuna runs out in a hurry.]

Wakka: "Yo! Sleepyhead!"

Yuna: "Sorry! I'm so sorry! Please forgive me."

Lulu: "Really, there's no rush... Here, your hair."

Wakka: "A summoner with bed hair! What's the world comin' to?"

Yuna: "You could have woken me up!

Lulu: "We called to  you, but with all that snoring..."

Yuna: "Mmm...what is it today? Everyone's picking on me!"

[Everyone chuckles, including Auron.]

Yuna: "You, too, Sir Auron?"

Auron: "Once Lady Yuna can fixes her hair, we leave!"

[Everyone starts to walk out.]

T-Narrative: I hadn't really laughed like that in a long time. It was only
             later that I realized... The only one really laughin then...was
             me. Laughing must have been the only thing keeping them going.

[The party stops when they meet the Chocobo Knights.]

Lucil: "Off so early? Lady Yuna, you must be exhausted working so hard last
       night. Will you be okay?"

Yuna: "I feel that I have rested enough. But, thank you for your kindness! Will
      you be leaving, too?"

Lucil: "Yes, first we cross the Moonflow, and then we head north in search of
       chocobos to replace those we have lost."

Elma: "Once we find chocobos, our Mounted Forces will ride again!"

Tidus: "Huh? Aren't you missing someone?"

Clasko: "Captain! Waaaaait for meee!"

[Clasko runs over.]

Elma: "What took you so long? We're leaving!"

Clasko: "You expect me to keep up with a chocobo!?"

Lucil: "Lady Yuna, I wish you good fortune. Elma! Clasko! Let's go!"

Elma: "Ma'am!"

Clasko: "Eh!? Can't I just rest a sec...?"

Elma: "No complaints!"

[They leave, and Yuna's team heads to the crossroads again.]

Tidus: "Where to next?"

Lulu: "We cross the Moonflow."

Tidus: "Gotcha! Moonflow, baby, here we come!"

[Not far down the road, the party sees Biran and Yenke. A stranger who was
with them bolts off down the road.]

Biran: "Look! One of Kimahri's friends. Looks just like him."

Tidus: "What?"

Biran: "Both follow summoners on all fours! Hornless goatlings!"

Yenke: "Hornless! Hornless!

Kimahri: "You come to insult Kimahri?"

Biran: "Wrong. We came to warn little Kimahri."

Yenke: "Summoners disappear. Never return."

Biran: "Next will be Kimahri's summoner."

Yenke: "Poor Kimahri! Lost his horn, next lose his summoner!

Biran: "Pitiful Kimahri! Howl alone! Howl alone!"

[The two run off.]

Tidus: "Do those two got something against you? What, they were just picking
       on you?"

Kimahri: "Kimahri will deal with them."

Tidus: "And I'll help!"

Kimahri: "Kimahri alone."

Tidus: "But..."

Wakka: "It's Kimahri's problem. We can't interfere; it's a rule."

Lulu: "I'm worried."

Wakka: "Let the Ronso deal with Ronso problems, ya? That's how it's always
       been."

Lulu: "I mean I'm worried about those summoners disappearing."

Auron: "They aren't just disappearing into thin air."

Tidus: "Hey, if we guardians do our job...no problem, right?"

Wakka: "Whoa!"

Lulu: "Confident."

Tidus: "Yeah!"

[The party arrives at the Moonflow, a beautiful, scenic river.]

Lulu: "This is the Moonflow."

Yuna: "These are moonlilies! They say that clouds of pyreflies gather here
      when night falls."

Lulu: "The entire river glows, like a sea of stars."

Tidus: "Really? Hey, I got an idea!"

Auron: "We're not waiting till nightfall."

Tidus: "Then, once we beat Sin, we're coming back!"

Wakka: "Hey, we better hurry or we'll miss the shoopuf!"

Tidus: "Shoopuf? That some kind of boat?"

[The party walks into the next screen.]

Tidus: "Whoa, what the...whoa!"

[Tidus sees an elephantine creature with a roll-up trunk.]

Wakka: "This is a shoopuf."

Tidus: "Whoa... Let's ride! Come on, let's go!"

Wakka: "All right! We board soon as we're ready, ya?"

[On the wharf nearby:]

Driver: "Ride ze shoopuf?"
        R1 --> Not yet.
        R2 --> I'm ready! Let me on!

        R1: "Shoopuf's waiting!
        R2: "All aboards!"

[The party gets on the shoopuf.]

Driver: "Shoopuf's launchin'!"

[In the carriage atop the shoopuf, the party sits silently.]

Wakka: "Hey. Take a look."

Tidus: "What? Whoa!"

[Buildings lie under the water.]

Tidus: "A sunken city!"

Wakka: "A machina city -- a thousand years old! They built the city on top of
       bridges across the river."

Lulu: "But the weight of the city caused the bridges to collapse, and it all
      sank to the bottom."

Wakka: "Right. It's a good lesson."

Tidus: "A lesson?"

Wakka: "Yeah. Why build a city over a river, ya?"

Tidus: "Uh... Well, it would be convenient, with all that water there."

Wakka: "Nope, that's not why. They just wanted to prove they could defy the
       laws of nature!"

Tidus: "Hmmm? I'm not so sure about that."

Wakka: "Yevon has taught us: When humans have power, they seek to use it. If
       you don't stop them, they go too far, ya?"

Tidus: "Yeah, but don't you use machina, too? Like the stadium and stuff,
       right?"

Lulu: "Yevon, it decides...which machina we may use, and which we may not."

Tidus: "So which kind of machina may we not use, then?"

Wakka: "Remember Operation Mi'ihen? That kind."

Lulu: "Or war will rage again."

Tidus: "War?"

Yuna: "More than a thousand years ago... Mankind waged war using machina to
      kill!"

Wakka: "They kept building more and more powerful machina."

Lulu: "They made weapons so powerful... It was thought they could destroy the
      entire world."

Yuna: "The people feared that Spira would be destroyed."

Wakka: "But the war did not stop!"

Tidus: "Wh-What happened then?"

Yuna: "Sin came, and it destroyed the cities and their machina."

Lulu: "The war ended...and our reward...was Sin."

Wakka: "So, Sin's our punishment for lettin' things get out of hand, eh?"

Tidus: "Man, that's rough."

Wakka: "Yeah, it is."

Tidus: "But, it's not like the machina are bad."

Lulu: "Only as bad as their users."

Wakka: "It's because of people like the Al Bhed screwin' everything up!"

[A loud splash is heard.]

Driver: "Whatsh could thatsh be?"

Auron: "Sit down!"

Yuna: "S-Sorry!"

[An Al Bhed leaps onto the shoopuf and takes Yuna into the water.]

Wakka: "The Al Bhed!"

[Wakka and Tidus dive in.]

Wakka: "Yuna, we'll save you!"

[They start fighting the large machina contraption that's caged Yuna, and
defeat it. It sinks to the bottom and Yuna is brought back onboard.]

Lulu: "Are you hurt?"

Yuna: "No, I'm fine."

Wakka: "Grrah! Those Al Bhed!"

Driver: "Ish ebullibody okay?"

Yuna: "I'm sorry! We're all okay now!"

Auron: "Yuna!"

Driver: "Shoopuf full shpeed aheads!"

Wakka: "Damn the Al Bhed! What do they want from us? Could it have something
       to do with Luca? What are they after Yuna for? Wait! They're mad they
       lost the tournament! Or, wait! They're mad about Operation Mi'ihen!"

Lulu: "I wonder... Didn't Kimahri's clansman say something...about
      summoners...disappearing?"

Wakka: "Ah! So the Al Bhed are behind that! Those sand-blasted grease monkeys!"

Tidus: "Hey, Wakka. It's no use complaining about the Al Bhed now, right?
       We'll protect Yuna from anyone, anywhere. It's that easy. That's all I
       need to know!"

Wakka: "Well... I guess so."

Lulu: "You're right."

Yuna: (Thank you.)

[The party makes it to the north bank and the shoopuf sleeps, so everyone takes
a load off for the time being. Tidus goes on a walk and sees a person washed up
on the road to Guadosalam.]

Tidus: "You're...not dead?"

[FMV. The girl sheds her outer layer of waterproof clothes.]

Rikku: "I thought I wa done for, back there."

Tidus: "Rikku! You're Rikku! Hey! You're okay! How you been?"

Rikku: "Terrible!"

Tidus: "Yeah, you don't lok so good. What happened?"

Rikku: "You beat me up, remember?"

Tidus: "Oh! That machina... That was you?"

Rikku: "That really hurt, you know. You big meanie!"

Tidus: "W-Wait! But you attacked us!"

Rikku: "Nuh-uh. It's not exactly what you think."

Wakka: "Yo!"

[The party comes down the road to the two.]

Wakka: "Friend of yours?"

Tidus: "Uh, you could say that."

Rikku: "Pleased to meet you! I'm Rikku!"

Tidus: "Yuna, Lulu... I told you about her, remember? She was the one who
       helped me before I was washed up on Besaid! She's an Al Bhe...beh..."

Wakka: "Wow, so you, like, owe her your life! What luck meeting here, ya?
       Praise be to Yevon! So, uh... Rikku... You look a little beat up. You
       okay?"

Lulu: "Uh, Wakka..."

Wakka: "Huh? What?"

Yuna: "There's something we need to discuss."

Wakka: "Oh, go ahead."

Rikku: "Girls only! Boys please wait over there!"

Lulu: "Right. Sorry, Wakka."

[The girls talk for awhile.]

Yuna: "Sir Auron... I would like Rikku to be my guardian."

[Auron walks over to Rikku; she avoids eye contact.]

Auron: "Show me your face. Look at me."

Rikku: "Oh, okay."

Auron: "Open your eyes."

[She opens them, showing her green-with-swirl-pattern eyes.]

Auron: "As I thought."

Rikku: "Um... No good?"

Auron: "Are you certain?"

Rikku: "A hundred percent! So, anyway... Can I?"

Auron: "If Yuna wishes it."

Yuna: "Yes, I do."

Tidus: "Rikku's a good girl. She helped me a bunch!"

Wakka: "Well, I'm for it! The more, the merrier!"

Rikku: "Then I'll just have to be the merriest!"

T-Narrative: It was strange. Even though Wakka had always hated the Al Bhed...

Rikku: "Rikku, at your service!"

T-Narrative: He never realized Rikku was one of them.

[The party gets into a battle.]

Rikku: "Oooh! A treasure chest! I wonder what's inside?"

Narrative: [Treasure Chests in Battles]

           Use the Special ability Steal to open treasure chests found on the
           battlefield. Be careful! The battle will end as soon as your foes
           are defeated, and any unopened treasure chests will be lost. Also,
           attacking a treasure chest will destroy it and all of its contents.

[A monster attacks her.]

Rikku: "You should know, I'm scary when I'm mad! I'm gonna use that item I just
       got on you! You'll be sorry!"

Narrative: [Mixing]

           Rikku's Overdrive Mix allows her to combine two items in stock and
           create various special effects. The results are unknown until the
           items are actually mixed. Try mixing the two Bomb Cores you just
           found to see what happens.

[Rikku creates a Firestorm and kills the enemy.]

Wakka: "Wh-What did you just do!?"

Tidus: "That was great!"

Rikku: "I can combine items and use them like this. It's not that tough,
       really."

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

[The party walks into the town. A Guado man approaches.]

Man: "We have been expecting you, Lady Yuna. Welcome to Guadosalam. This way,
     my lady. This way."

[He goes to take her hand, but Wakka stops him.]

Wakka: "Whoa, whoa, whoa!"

Tromell: "Oh, I beg your pardon. I am called Tromell Guado. I am in the direct
         service of our leader, the great Seymour Guado. Lord Seymour has very
         important business with Lady Yuna."

Yuna: "Business with me? Whatever could it be, I wonder?"

Tromell: "Please, come inside the manor. All will be explained. Of course,
         your friends are also welcome."

[Everyone starts to follow Tromell to the manner.]

Rikku: "Twist our arms, why don't ya? Ah, I almost forgot!"

[She turns back to Tidus.]

Narrative: [Customizing Equipment]

           Now that Rikku has joined your party, you can customize weapons
           and armor. Let's take a look! Customize is used to upgrade weapons
           and armor by adding abilities to them. Use items to add abilities to
           your gear and customize it to your liking. First, choose the
           equipment you wish to customize. Note that some weapons and armor
           cannot be customized. If any of the slots in the Abilities window
           shown at the bottom right of the screen are empty...you can
           customize that piece of equipment. If the equipment has no empty
           slots, it cannot be customized any further. Note that some equipment
           cannot be customized at all. Let's give it a try! Once you select a
           piece of equipment to customize...a list of abilities available for
           that equipment will be displayed. The item cost for each new ability
           is displayed at the top right. On the left is the number of the
           required item currently in stock...and on the right, the quantity of
           that item remaining after the procedure. If you have insufficient
           items to add an ability...that ability is displayed in gray and
           cannot be selected. When you select an ability to add...you are
           asked to confirm the procedure. Select "Yes" to complete the
           procedure. Note that equipment will sometimes receive a new name
           after receiving a new ability. This concludes the Customize
           tutorial.

Rikku: "What would you do without me?"

[They walk into Seymour's manor and Tromell opens the doors to the hall.]

Tromell: "This way, please. I will go inform Lord Seymour. Please wait here."

[Tromell leaves, the reappears once you've talked to all party members.]

Tromell: "Truly, it is good to have guests again. Since Lord Jyscal passed
         away, these halls have been too quiet."

Yuna: "The death of Lord Jyscal was a great loss for all of Spira."

[Tidus and Wakka stand off to themselves.]

Tidus: "Was that Maester Jyscal really such a great guy?"

Wakka: "He brought the teachings of Yevon to the Guado. He was truly a great
       man."

Tromell: "Truly, a loss for us all. But now a new leader, Lord Seymour, has
         come before us. Lord Seymour is the child of a Guado and a human. He
         will be the tie that binds our two races together. But that is not
         all, I think. Lord Seymour... He will surely become the shining star
         that lights the way for all the peoples of Spira."

Seymour: "That is enough, Tromell."

[Seymour is in the doorway.]

Seymour: "Must I always endure such praise? Welcome!"

Yuna: "You...wanted to see me?"

Seymour: "Please, make yourselves at home. There's no rush."

Auron: "Please, keep this short. Yuna must rush."

Seymour: "Pardon me. It has been a long time since I had guests. Lady Yuna,
         this way."

[FMV. The floor and the atmosphere of the room changes to that of space, with
shooting stars and meteor showers. It's changes to Zanarkand soon after.]

Seymour: "This sphere is a reconstruction created from the thoughts of the dead
         that wander the farplane."

Tidus: "Zanarkand!"

Seymour: "Correct. Zanarkand as it looked one thousand years ago. The great
         and wondrous machina city, Zanarkand. She once lived in this
         metropolis."

Yuna: "She, who?"

[The hologram shows a woman's chambers, complete with woman on her bed.]

Yuna: "Lady Yunalesca!"

Seymour: "She was the first person to defeat Sin and save the world from its
         ravages. And you have inherited her name."

Yuna: "It was my father who named me."

Seymour: "Lord Braska was entrusting you with a great task. He wanted you to
         face Sin, as Lady Yunalesca did. However, Lady Yunalesca did not save
         the world alone. To defeat the undefeatable Sin...it took an
         unbreakable bond of love -- of the kind that binds two hears for
         eternity.

[A hologram man walks to Yunalesca. The hologram disappears, and Seymour asks
Yuna something that only she hears. It's upsetting news; so much so, that she
guzzles an entire glass of water to get her bearings.]

Rikku: "Wow! Your face is beet red!"

Tidus: "You okay?"

Yuna: "He...he asked me to marry him!"

Tidus: "You serious?"

Auron: "You know what Yuna must do."

Seymour: "Of course. Lady Yuna -- no, all summoners -- are charged with
         bringing peace to Spira. But this means more than just defeating Sin.
         She must ease the suffering of all Spira. She must be a leader for the
         people. I proposed to Lady Yuna as a maester of Yevon."

Auron: "Spira is no playhouse. A moment's diversion may amuse an audience, but
       it changes nothing."

Seymour: "Even so, the actors must play their parts. There's no need to answer
         right away. Please, think it over."

Auron: "We will do so, then. We leave."

Seymour: "Lady Yuna, I await your favorable reply."

[Auron walks to the door.]

Seymour: "Why are you still here, sir? I beg your pardon. We Guado are keen
         to the scent of the Farplane."

[Tidus starts sniffing Auron, who pushes him away and leaves. Everyone heads
outside to regroup.]

Lulu: "Yuna, the high summoner's daughter. Seymour, the leader of the Guado.
      Married in the name of Yevon, overcoming the barriers of race. It would
      give Spira something cheery to talk about, for a change."

Wakka: "Sounds just like a passin' daydream, like Auron says."

Tidus: "Come on, let's just get on with the pilgrimage! I mean, marriage?"

Rikku: "Hmmm. Jealous?"

Tidus: "What? No way! We gotta defeat Sin. Romance can wait!"

Wakka: "He sure picked a fine time to lay this one on us."

Yuna: "Maybe it is a fine time."

Tidus: "You serious?"

Yuna: "If my getting married would help Spira...if it would make people
      happy... If I could do that for people...maybe I should do what I can. I
      never imagined doing anything like this. But, I won't answer till I know
      what's right."

Tidus: "Seriously?"

Rikku: "You can always just quit your pilgrimage and get married."

Yuna: "I will...go on. I'm sure that Lord Seymour will understand."

Rikku: "Umm, I guess so..."

Yuna: "I am a summoner! I must fight and defeat Sin."

Auron: "Like Braska before you."

T-Narrative: I had to stop myself from shouting: What's there to think about?

Yuna: "I'm going to the Farplane. I'm going to see my father and think on
      this."

Lulu: "Go on, we'll be right behind you."

T-Narrative: I wondered why none of the others ever asked Yuna. Do you love
             Seymour? Do you even like him?

[Everyone heads to the Farplane's entrance.]

Tidus: "Question! About this Farplane... When somebody dies, a summoner sends
       them to the Farplane, right? So their souls, or whatever they are, they
       go to the Farplane, right? But that's the Farplane we're going to,
       right? And Yuna's old man's there, too? Do dead people live there or
       something?

[Tidus imagines a bunch of ghosts.]

Wakka: "You're thinking those funny thoughts again, ya? You'll see once we
       get there."

[Everyone starts heading in; Auron takes a seat.]

Tidus: "Aren't you coming?"

Auron: "I do not belong there."

Tidus: "You're scared!

Auron: "Searching the past to find the future... This is all that is there. I
       need it not. You'd better get going."

Rikku: "You're not really going to see the dead, more like your memories of
       them. People think of their relatives, and the pyreflies react to them.
       They take on the form of the dead person -- an illusion, nothing else."

Tidus: "Hmm..."

Rikku: "Well, have fun!"

Tidus: "What, you're not going either, Rikku?"

Rikku: "I keep my memories inside."

Tidus: "Huh?"

Rikku: "Memories are nice, but that's all they are."

[Tidus walks into the Farplane.]

Tidus: "What the...?"

[FMV. The platform everyone is standing on is dwarfed by a huge view of water-
-falls and a moon. Tidus sees Yuna with Braska and her mother.]

T-Narrative: The Farplane was cool, but I couldn't stop thinking about Yuna.
             Her parents -- they looked so happy together. But it got me
             worried that maybe seeing them would make Yuna really consider
             Seymour's proposal.

[Tidus walks to Yuna and her 'family' after talking with Wakka and Lulu.]

Tidus: "So...Yuna?"

Yuna: "I've decided."

Tidus: "Oh? Really? That's good."

Yuna: "I remember, when I was only seven years old, in Bevelle that day. My
      father had defeated Sin, and the whole town was out in the streets.
      Everyone was laughing. They all seemed so happy. If I defeated Sin, that
      would make everyone happy...wouldn't it? I must do what everyone wants,
      not just what I want."

Tidus: "Let's go back! You gotta tell Seymour."

Yuna: "Before that... Call Sir Jecht. Give it a try. Don't worry. He won't
      come."

T-Narrative: Trying not to think about my old man made me think about him, of
             course.

Yuna: "See, told you!"

T-Narrative: He isn't here because he's not dead. He's Sin.

Yuna: "That means he's alive, you know?"

T-Narrative: What if my old man really is Sin? What would I say to Yuna...heck,
             to everybody in Spira? Wait, why should I have to apologize for
             him, anyway?

Tidus: "I'd rather never seen him again."

Yuna: "What makes you hate him so?"

Tidus: "Everything he does just makes me mad. It was his fault that me and my
       mother..."

[Tidus looks up to see his mom floating near him.]

Tidus: "Mom? It's her!"

Yuna: "She's very pretty."

Tidus: "But... Wait. No one ever performed the sending for her."

Yuna: "She must have accepted death while she was still alive."

Tidus: "Whoa there, that's my mother you're talking about."

Yuna: "Oh, I'm sorry!"

Tidus: "It's okay. I think I just figured something out."

Yuna: "What?"

Tidus: "Why I hate my old man."

[Tidus flashes back to Zanarkand. Jecht and his mother are talking abovedeck.]

Jecht: "See? So I told him what I thought of him, right there!"

Tidus' Mother: "Really?"

Jecht: "'Course!"

Tidus' Mother: "I suppose, but..."

Young Tidus: "Mommy..."

Tidus' Mother: "Just a sec, dear."

Tidus: "Whenever my old man was around, my mother wouldn't even look at me.
       Maybe that's when I started to resent him, even hate him. When he left
       us...Mom just lost her energy."

[The flashback goes ahead a ways. Auron is there with Young Tidus.]

Auron: "Is she all right?"

Young Tidus: "Why should you care?"

Auron: "If she dies, I wouldn't know what to do."

Young Tidus: "Don't say Mom is gonna die!"

Auron: "I apologize."

Tidus: "The old lady next door told me...when a lovebird dies, the one left
       behind... It just gives up on living so it can join its mate. It was
       just like that. I hated my old man even more. But really, my old man...

[Tidus recalls the scene a few seconds earlier:]

Young Tidus: "Mommy..."

Tidus' Mother: "Just a sec, dear."

Jecht: "Ah, go to him. He'll cry if you don't."

[The flashback ends and Tidus is back on the Farplane.]

Tidus: "Oh, man... I must sound so stupid."

Yuna: "I don't think so."

Tidus: "How embarrassing!"

[Wakka and Lulu are waiting for the two.]

Wakka: "Well? Need some more time?"

Yuna: "No, I'm ready."

Lulu: "Did I miss something?"

[They leave the Farplane and go back to Auron and Rikku.]

Yuna: "Thanks for waiting! I'll go give my answer to Maester Seymour."

[Suddenly, a Guado spirit from the Farplane starts to leave.]

Guado Woman: "Lord Jyscal!?"

Guado: "Lord Jyscal!"

Auron: "He does not belong here."

Yuna: "Why?"

Auron: "Yuna, send him."

[Auron nearly collapses for some reason, but no one sees because their backs
are turned. Yuna goes to Jyscal's spirit.]

Yuna: "Lord Jyscal..."

Lulu: "He is Lord Jyscal no more. Send him now!"

[She sends him and he drops a sphere, which Yuna picks up.]

Auron: "Talk later. We leave now."

[On the way back:]

Wakka: "Wha...what was that just now? That really Lord Jyscal?
       R1 --> Wait, I know!"
       R2 -->

       R1 (Tidus): "He wasn't sent, so he became a fiend, right?"

          [Skip to Lulu's line.]

       R2: [Tidus doesn't say anything; skip down to Yuna's line.]

Yuna: "I don't understand how a man like Lord Jyscal could die and not be
      sent." [This is said if you don't pick one of the above options.]

Lulu: "I would think he was sent once...but he stayed on Spira. Something, a
      powerful emotion could have bound him to this world. Such things happen."

Rikku: "That's against the rules, isn't it?"

Auron: "It means he died an unclean death."

[The party regroups in front of Seymour's manor.]

Yuna: "I will go...meet with Maester Seymour."

Auron: "Yuna! Jyscal is the Guado's problem, not yours."

[Yuna enters the manor and the party waits around. Tidus follows Lulu; or,
Rikku runs over to Tidus. Whichever happens is affection-based.]

Tidus: "Umm..."
Lulu: "What?"
Tidus: "So, Lulu, what do you think about Yuna getting married?"
Lulu: "As long as the pilgrimage continues, either way's fine."
Tidus: "That's it? What if she doesn't even like the guy? Is that okay?"
Lulu: "People marry for different reasons."
Tidus: "What's that mean?"
Lulu: "Sometimes marriage doesn't require love, you know? Defeat Sin, and bring
      joy to the people of Spira. For Yuna, they're just two ways down the same
      road. All you need is determination. If you have that, you don't need
      love."
Tidus: "I don't know... I just don't get it."

[If Rikku runs over:]

Rikku: "Wait up, I'll go with ya!"
[They walk for a bit.]
Rikku: "Yunie's not getting married, is she?"
Tidus: "Seems that way."
Rikku: "It's your big chance, huh?"
       R1 --> I don't care.
       R2 --> I guess you're right.
       R3 --> I'd rather have you, Rikku.

       R1: "That's no thing to say! I think she should get married
           and stop being a summoner!"
       R2: "That's the way to go! Then you could take her away
           and live a quiet life somewhere. Yeah, sounds good to
           me!"
           Tidus: "You serious?"
           Rikku: "Yeah."
           Tidus: "Why?"
           Rikku: "Because it's tough, you know? In the end, she
                  has to fight Sin."
           Tidus: "Yeah, but she... She would never marry someone
                  who wanted her to quit."
           Rikku: "I guess you're right. Too bad."
       R3: "Oh! H-honest?"
           [She acts shy and hits Tidus thrice.]
           Rikku: "See ya! Syopa musatyo!" ["See ya! Maybe someday!"]


[Tidus walks down by the Thunder Plains entrance. Shelinda appears.]

Shelinda: "My... Was the lady summoner not with you?"

Tidus: "No. She's at Seymour's place."

Shelinda: "That's 'Maester Seymour' or 'Lord Seymour.'"

Tidus: "Oh, I'll be careful. Sorry."

Shelinda: "That's all right. Maester Seymour left Guadosalam a short while
          ago."

Tidus: "You serious?"

Shelinda: "I believe he went to the temple in Macalania. Maester Seymour is
          also the high priest of that temple."

Tidus: "Whoa, I gotta tell the others!"

[Tidus runs back and tells the story. Inside the manor, Yuna stares at Jyscal's
picture on the wall.]

Yuna: "Lord Jyscal, please tell me. What can I do to help?"

Rikku: "Yuna, let's go!"

[She walks outside.]

Tidus: "They say Seymour went to Macarena Temple."

Wakka: "Macalania Temple."

Tidus: "Aye."

Wakka: "What I don't get is... Why would the lord maester head off without a
       peep to anyone?"

Rikku: "Maybe he wasn't expecting Yuna's answer so soon."

Wakka: "Ah, that's probably it."

[Yuna looks uncomfortable.]

Auron: "Yuna, what is it?"

Yuna: "Oh, nothing."

Auron: "Hmm... You're a poor liar."

Yuna: "It's true. It's nothing! Come on, let's go."

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

[The party starts walking towards the Thunder Plains. Rikku is terrified.]

Rikku: "Oh, no... We're here."

[Thunderbolts skitter across the plains.]

Tidus: "How are we supposed to cross that?"

Lulu: "See the lightning rod towers? The lightning is drawn to them...
      hopefully."

Wakka: "We head north, not too near and not too far from the towers, ya?"

Lulu: "Meaning we should avoid wide, open areas."

Rikku: "I think I forgot something in Guadosalam."

Auron: "Nice knowing you."

Rikku: "Okay, okay! I'll go!"

Narrative: [Moving across the Thunder Plains]

           Lightning can strike Tidus on the Gandof Thunder Plains. Lightning
           can strike at any time, so keep moving. The lightning rod towers
           absorb nearby lightning. Seek shelter under them. When there are no
           towers nearby, you can dodge lightning by pressing (X). Hit (X) as
           soon as you see a lightning flash. If successful, you can dodge the
           thunderbolt. Constantly mashing (X), however, can be dangerous. Good
           luck on your journey.

[The party walks by a lightning rod tower and sees it get struck.]

Wakka: "Whoa! That was a close one!"

Lulu: "Stop kidding around."

Wakka: "Yes, ma'am..."

Rikku: "Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh..."

Wakka: "Hmm? What's wrong?"

Rikku: "Eh heh heh heh heh heh heh..."

Tidus: "'Heh heh heh...' You're givin' me the creeps!"

Rikku: "I wanna go home! I hate lightning! I hate thunder! Let's go rest over
       there! Please?"

Auron: "This storm never stops. Better to cross quickly."

Rikku: "I know, but... Just for a little while?"

Tidus: "Heh, well? What now?"

[The party starts to walk by a travel agency, paying it no mind.]

Rikku: "Pretty please? Just for a few minutes? I'm scared of lightning! Let's
       rest, please? Pretty please? I'm too young to die! You're mean...cruel!
       Your moms would be ashamed of you! Are you having fun doing this to me?"

[The party who had walked out of sight walks back.]

Auron: "Fine, we rest. She's worse than the storm."

[They walk inside the travel agency.]

Yuna: "I'm...a little tired. Do you have a room available?"

Clerk: "Ah, Lady Summoner. Yes, just over that way."

Yuna: "Thank you."

Wakka: "Uh, Yuna?"

[She goes to a resting room.]

Lulu: "It's not like her."

[Tidus goes into the hallway a little while later. He puts his ear to the door
when he thinks he hears a man in there.]

Tidus: "Wha...?

[He stumbles in after trying to open it a smidgen. Yuna has a sphere open
with a man's hologram in it.]

Tidus: "Whoa!"

Yuna: "Y-Yes?"

[Tidus looks at the hologram and she turns it off.]

Tidus: "I...well... It's nothing, really. I...I just, uh... I'm sorry... I
       shouldn't have come in. H-Hey! Wasn't that that Jyscal Guado guy?"

Yuna: "The sphere is his will... It says, 'Take care of my son.'"

Tidus: "His son...? Seymour?" Well, I know one way to take care of him."

Yuna: "I'm sorry."

[She runs out of the room. Tidus gravitates towards the sphere, wanting to get
a peek, but Wakka sneaks in and restrains him.]

Wakka: "What do you think you're up to?"

Tidus: "Yuna...Yuna was acting funny, s-so..."

Wakka: "Yeah, yeah! She'll tell us when she's ready, so hold your chocobos
       till then, ya?"

Tidus: "All right! All right! All right!"

[After resting up, Rikku still won't move.]

Rikku: "It's not stopping, is it?"

Auron: "Don't tell me you were hoping it would. Fine. Stay here."

[Auron walks outside.]

Rikku: "All right, already. But! You didn't have to say it like that, you know!
       You could be more comforting or something! You know, try to cheer me up?
       You just don't get me at all, do you? Hey! Are you listening? I'm not
       scared! I'm not scared, you hear?

[Rikku walks confidently outside. A man runs by to take Yuna's picture with
a sphere (same from boat?) and runs off, in a short little scene. Yuna stops
the party when they're almost through the Thunder Plains.]

Yuna: "Everyone...wait."

Wakka: "What's up?"

Yuna: "I have something to tell you."

Lulu: "Here?"

Rikku: "We're almost out of here! Let's go!"

Yuna: "I have to say it now!"

[Auron looks at a sheltered structure.]

Auron: "Over there."

[They walk over.]

T-Narrative: Somehow, my bad feelings always come true.

Yuna: "I've decided to marry."

Lulu: "I thought so."

Wakka: "B-But why? Why'd you change your mind?"

Yuna: "For Spira's future...and Yevon's unity. I thought it would be the best
      thing to do."

Auron: "That's not good enough."

Lulu: "Wait, is it... Is it because of Lord Jyscal?"

Tidus: "Hey! That sphere!"

Auron: "Show me."

Yuna: "I can't. I must speak to Maester Seymour first. I truly am sorry, but
      this is... It is a personal matter."

Wakka: "You're kidding, ya?"

Auron: "As you wish."

Yuna: "I'm sorry."

Auron: "Just one thing."

Yuna: "I won't quit my pilgrimage."

Auron: "Then it is...fine."

Tidus: "Wait a minute, Auron! You don't care? I mean, you're not going to stop
       her?"

Auron: "No, I'm not. As long as she is willing to face Sin...all else is her
       concern. That is a summoner's privelege. As long as she journeys."

Tidus: "But that's..."

Wakka: "Yuna, just one question. Can't you just talk to Maester Seymour?
       You've got to marry him?"

Yuna: "I don't know. But I think it is the right thing to do."

Wakka: "Okay, I guess."

Rikku: "Yunie..."

[A thunderbolt strikes.]

Rikku: "Quiet! I wish we could help somehow, some way!"

Yuna: "It's okay... I'll be fine."

T-Narrative: She says, "I'm sorry." He says, "It's fine." She's "willing" to
             face Sin. She's "privileged." I didn't understand. But somehow,
             I felt like I didn't belong. But if I didn't belong with them,
             I'd be stuck in Spira, alone. And being alone in that place,
             well, I didn't want to think about it.

Auron: "Next, we're going to Macalania Temple. Yuna can talk with Seymour
       there. We guardians will wait until they're done, and plan our next
       move. Understood?"

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

[The party walks into the eerily silent forest. Auron and Tidus straggle to
talk.]

Auron: "You're worried about Yuna."

Tidus: "'Course I'm worried about her. What is she thinking?"

Auron: "The simplest answer would be...in exchange for agreeing to marry
       him...she hopes to negotiate with Seymour."

Tidus: "Negotiate what?"

Auron: "I wonder."

Tidus: "What? All by herself?"

Auron: "She's strong, but Seymour is the better negotiator."

Tidus: "Well then, why don't we do something about it?"

Auron: "Yuna wants it this way."

Tidus: "Argh! I just don't get it! Doesn't she trust us?"

Auron: "On the contrary... She doesn't want us caught up in whatever it is
       that she's planning."

Tidus: "Yeah, that's what I thought. But that makes me worry even more. She
       could just tell us."

Auron: "That's the way she is. She's naive, serious to a fault, and doesn't
       ask for help."

Tidus: "You're probably right."

Auron: "Yuna's easy to read."

Tidus: "Yeah, she is."

Auron: "But hard to guard. Stand by her, always."

[Auron and Tidus rejoin the others.]

Rikku: "Slowpokes!"

Tidus: "Sorry!"

T-Narrative: It's funny how calm I was. Maybe it was because I realized that
             Yuna wasn't marrying Seymour for love. Not really. It was just
             her duty -- something she had to do before returning to her
             pilgrimage. That's what I kept telling myself, anyway. And well,
             maybe... I realized that Yuna and I'd never... You know...

Tidus: "Yuna, let's go."

[The party walks into the forest and they soon see Barthello running to them.]

Barthello: "Hey! You, have you seen Dona?"

Tidus: "Dona? Can't say I have."

Wakka: "What's up?"

Barthello: "We got separated on the way here. Damn it all! I've got to find
           her!"

Auron: "Calm down."

Barthello: "But, if anything happens to her..."

Auron: "Running around in a panic is not going to help. Right now, you have to
       keep cool, and search."

Barthello: "But--"

Auron: "Guard your emotions, then guard your summoner."

Barthello: "You're right."

Auron: "Shall we search?"

Barthello: "No, I've taken up enough of your time. Thank you, Sir Auron."

[Barthello runs back the way he came. Rikku starts to run after him.]

Wakka: "What's up?"

Rikku: "Oh, I just wanted to wish him good luck."

[The party continues on and sees a bird-beaked man with a harp, like the ones
who played instruments during the Luca tournament.]

Man: "A butterfly with rainbow wings
     Will lead the way to secret things."

Narrative: [Macalania Woods Butterfly Hunt]

           Approach the butterfly of many huges, and its red and blue brethren
           shall appear. Try to catch seven of the blue butterflies, but beware
           the reds, for they call powerful fiends when threatened. Butterflies
           disappear after a certain time. Try catching the blue butterflies
           while avoiding the red ones.

[The party walks along, but Auron stops them for a moment.]

Auron: "Wait. It is here...somewhere."

Tidus: "What's here?"

Auron: "Something you should see."

Yuna: "But, Sir Auron..."

Auron: "It won't take long."

[With only three swings, Auron carves a path through a mess of thickets and
fallen trees. They all walk into see a beautiful spring that was hidden from
sight.]

Tidus: "This place... It's just water, isn't it?"

Auron: "This is what spheres are made of. It absorbs and preserves people's
       memories."

[The water steams and a large sphere-monster floats up.]

Wakka: "What's that?"

Auron: "Fiends are also attracted to these places."

[They defeat the giant monster. A sphere is left behind in its aftermath.]

Narrative: Obtained Jecht's sphere!

Wakka: "Whoa, this is old! Don't know if you can play it back.

Auron: "Jecht left it here ten years ago. Play it back."

[Tidus plays it. In it, a younger Auron is shown, with Jecht as the cameraman.
They appear to be leaving an ornate city, probably Bevelle.]

Auron: "What are you taking?"

Jecht: "Well, you said it was gonna be a long trip. We'll be seeing a lot of
       neat things, right? So I thought I'd record it all in this. To show to
       my wife and kid, you know."

Auron: "This is no pleasure cruise!"

Jecht: "Hey, Braska. Ain't this supposed to be a grand occasion? Where're the
       cheering fans? The crying women?"

Braska: "This is it. Too many goodbyes -- people think twice about leaving."

Jecht: "Hmm... If you say so. Well, it better be a lot more colorful when we
       come back. A parade for Braska, vanquisher of Sin!"

Braska: "We should go. Day will break soon."

[The sphere picks up later, with Braska as cameraman this time. A sign above
the two says 'Laka Macalania.']

Braska: "Auron, could you stand closer to him? Good. That should do it."

Jecht: "What's the matter? Afraid I might bite?"

Auron: "Jecht..."

Jecht: "Braska! You should take one, too. It'd make a great gift for little
       Yuna!"

Braska: "I suppose."

Auron: "Lord Braska... We shouldn't be wasting our time like this!"

Jecht: "What's the hurry, man?"

Auron: "Let me tell you what the hurry is!"

Braska: "Auron!"

[The sphere shuts off.]

Tidus: "What's the point? He wasn't on some pleasure cruise."

Rikku: "I think there's more."

[The sphere kicks on again, showing the place where the party currently is. It
shows Jecht sitting in front of the camera.]

Jecht: "Hey. If you're sitting there, watching this...it means you're stuck in
       Spira, like me. You might not know when you'll get back home, but you
       better not be crying! Although, I guess I'd understand. But you know
       what? There's a time when you have to stop crying and move on. You'll be
       fine. Remember, you're my son. And... Well, uh... Never mind. I'm no
       good at these things."

[Jecht shuts the sphere off; it starts up again sometime later, same place.]

Jecht: "Anyways... I believe in you. Be good. Goodbye."

[The sphere shuts off for real.]

Tidus: "He sounded almost serious, but it was too late."

Auron: "He was serious. Jecht had already accepted his fate."

Tidus: "His fate?"

Auron: "Jecht... He... He was always talking about going home, to Zanarkand.
       That's why he took all those pictures -- to show them to you when he
       returned. But as he journeyed with us and came to understand Spira, and
       Braska's resolve... It happened gradually, but Jecht changed. He decided
       he would join Braska in his fight against Sin."

Tidus: "So then, he gave up going home?"

Auron: "That was his decision."

T-Narrative: I guess I understood. My old man... He knew there was no way home,
             back to Zanarkand. He wanted to go home, but he knew he couldn't.
             He couldn't go on until he accepted it. Besides...even if he had
             found a way back...I don't think he would have left his friends
             behind before their journey was complete.

Tidus: "All right! Let's go, guys!"

T-Narrative: Maybe I had to start accepting my own fate."

Narrative: [Jecht Spheres]

           Spheres that document Jecht's journey are hidden all over Spira.
           Defeating the Spherimorph has unlocked the seals that once bound the
           spheres. Find them!

Narrative: Auron has learned Overdrive Shooting Star!

[Everyone has went back to the path except Auron and Tidus.]

Auron: "Wait."

Tidus: "Yeah?"

Auron: "Jecht loved you."

Tidus: "Oh, come on, please!"

Auron: "He just didn't know how to express it, he said."

Tidus: "Enough about my old man, okay?"

Auron: "I just thought you should know."

Tidus: "Okay."

[Auron walks away.]

Tidus: "Thanks."

[The party finds a travel agency on the other side of the woods, but passes
it by in their haste. The party meets Tromell on the road afterwards.]

Tromell: "Lady Yuna, we've been expecting you. We were surprised you decided
         to come so soon. Pleasantly surprised, of course. Lord Seymour sends
         his apologies for having left without notice."

Yuna: "It's quite all right. I have one question, if I may, sir."

Tromell: "My lady?"

Yuna: "I want to keep journeying, even if I marry. Do you think that Maester
      Seymour would let me?"

Tromell: "But of course, my lady. Lord Seymour wishes nothing else, I'm sure."

[Yuna turns to her party.]

Yuna: "Goodbye."

Tromell: "Well... We must follow Guado tradition. I'll have to ask you wait
         here a little while longer. I'll send someone to escort you."

[Tromell walks off.]

Yuna: "I..."

Auron: "We're all with you. Do as you will."

Yuna: "Thank you."

[Yuna walks off; Auron glances at Tidus.]

Auron: "Sorry. That was your line."

Tidus: "Yuna!"

[Tidus whistles.]

Yuna: "Yessir!"

[Rikku looks over the side, to the lake.]

Rikku: "Oh, no!"

Wakka: "Al Bhed!"

[The party runs down to guard Tromell and Yuna.]

Auron: "Stand back."

Tromell: "Thank you!"

[Lady Yuna runs to assist.]

Tromell: "Lady Yuna!"

[An Al Bhed voice yells:]

Voice: "Rikku! Tuh'd ehdanvana un oui kad drec! Ouin bnaleuic magic yht
       aeons yna caymat!" ["Rikku! Don't interfere or you get this! Your
       precious magic and aeons are sealed!"]

Rikku: "Oh, no!"

Tidus: "Translation?"

Rikku: "He's gonna use an anti-magic field on us!"

Al Bhed: "Kad dras!" ["Get them!"]

[The battle starts with the Crawler and it shoots a device into the air.]

Narrative: Negator disables all magic and summoning!

[The Negator gets defeated.]

Wakka: "Lu! Cast your spells now!"

[The party scraps the vehicle.]

Tromell: "My lady!"

[Yuna and her Guado escort walk off together. On a snowhill, the Al Bhed who
knows Rikku stands.]

Al Bhed: "Rikku! E femm damm Vydran!" ["Rikku! I will tell Father!"]

Rikku: "E ys dra guardian uv Yuna, oui caa? Yuna ec cyva! Fa femm kiynt
       ran! Cra ec cyva!" ["I am the guardian of Yuna, you see? Yuna is
       safe! We will guard her! She is safe!"]

Al Bhed: "Oui tu drec ymuha, cecdan!" ["You do this alone, sister!"]

[He runs off.]

Rikku: "I told him I was a guardian. Well, guess I had to, really."

Wakka: "How come you speak Al Bhed? Why?"

Rikku: "Because I'm Al Bhed. And that...was my brother."

[He looks at the rest of his party.]

Wakka: "You knew? Why didn't you tell me?"

Lulu: "We knew you'd be upset."

Wakka: "This is great. I can't believe I've been travelling with an Al Bhed!
       A heathen!"

Rikku: "You're wrong! We have nothing against Yevon."

Wakka: "But you Al Bhed use the forbidden machina! You know what that means?
       Sin was born because people used machina!"

Rikku: "You got proof? Show me proof!"

Wakka: "It's in Yevon's teachings! Not that you'd know!"

Rikku: "That's not good enough! Yevon says this, Yevon says that. Can't you
       think for yourself?"

Wakka: "Well, then you tell me! Where did Sin come from, huh?"

Rikku: "I...I don't know!"

Wakka: "You bad-mouth Yevon and that's all you can come up with?"

Rikku: "But...that doesn't mean you should do whatever they say without
       thinking! Nothing will ever change that way!"

Wakka: "Nothing has to change!"

Rikku: "You want Sin to keep coming back? There might be a way to stop it,
       you know!"

Wakka: "Sin will be gone once we atone for our past mistakes!"

Rikku: "When? How?"

Wakka: "If we keep faith in Yevon's teachings it will be gone one day!"

Rikku: "Why do I even bother?"

Auron: "Rikku! Will this move?"

[Auron is looking at a snowmobile.]

Wakka: "We're not using that, are we? Wait... Sir Auron isn't an Al Bhed too,
       is he?"

Tidus: "Come on, Wakka..."

Wakka: "What?"

Tidus: "I mean, getting angry just 'cause you found out Rikku's an Al Bhed...
       You guys got along just fine till now, didn't you?"

Wakka: "That's different. I mean..."

Tidus: "Well, I don't claim to know that much about Spira. And I probably know
       even less about the Al Bhed, but...I know Rikku's a good person. She's
       just Rikku!"

Wakka: "Lu?"

Lulu: "Just think of this as an opportunity to learn more about the Al Bhed."

Wakka: "Ha!"

[Wakka starts walking to the temple.]

Auron: "Let him go. Give him time to think."

Rikku: "I'm sorry."

Lulu: "You've done nothing to apologize for."

Tidus: "All right! Let's ride!"

Rikku: "You sure you know how to drive this?"

Tidus: "Better than Kimahri does!

[The party gets on snowmobiles. Who rides with Tidus is affection-based,
so different people can ride with him. If Lulu rides:]

Lulu: "I hope you're not too mad at Wakka."
Tidus: "Hey, not at all."
Lulu: "Thank you."
Tidus: "Say, what do you think of Rikku?"
Lulu: "Me? She's...fun to be with."
Tidus: "That all?"
Lulu: "Well, I can tell she's not a bad person."
Tidus: "Yeah. You know what the problem is? She's just another Al Bhed to
       Wakka. Wakka's head is as hard as a rock. I bet it's because of Yevon.
       Or, you know, something like that."
Lulu: "Well, there's more to it than that."
Tidus: "Hmm?"
Lulu: "Wakka doesn't like the Al Bhed because of his brother Chappu."
Tidus: "Oh...he used a machina weapon, right? And got killed by Sin. Killed
       by my old man. Damn you, Jecht."
Lulu: "What?"
Tidus: "Oh, nothing! Hey... Can someone, like, a human become Sin ever?"
Lulu: "I can't say that I know, but why?"
Tidus: "Just a thought."
Lulu: "Sin is the punishment for, and the incarnation of, crimes we have
      committed."
Tidus: "So, no one really knows what it is?"
Lulu: "There's no need to know, so no one asks. You run or you fight. That is
      really all you can do. There's no sense brooding over it."
Tidus: "What, that's all? I mean, you don't even wonder?"
Lulu: "You really do come from a world where there is no Sin, like you say."

[If Rikku rides with:]

Tidus: "Sorry about Wakka."
Rikku: "He didn't have to be so mean, yeah? I almost cried."
Tidus: "Uh... Rikku?"
Rikku: "Just kidding! It's okay. At least you're still nice."
       Hey, do I look like Yunie, you think? Well, my dad's
       sister is Yunie's mother, you get it?"
Tidus: "I had no idea! If you say so. Okay! I guess you're
       guarding your family, then."
Rikku: "Yuna's not the only one that I want to protect. We Al Bhed
       want to protect all of the summoners, you know? Summoners
       are... Well, you could say that... they sacrifice themselves
       to, well... to bring happiness to Spira."
Tidus: "What do you mean? Rikku?"
Rikku: "Yes?"
Tidus: "'Sacrifice themselves'"?
Rikku: "You know, the pilgrimage...It takes a lot out of you."
Tidus: "Oh, right. But you know. Yuna's real serious about being a
       summoner. For Yuna, well the pilgrimage kinda means everything
       to her. You are going to help her, too, aren't you, Rikku?"
Tidus: "So you shouldn't say that Yuna's sacrificing herself."
[Rikku hugs Tidus.]
Tidus: "Rikku?"
Rikku: "I hope you're right."

[If Kimahri rides along:]

Tidus: "Say... What do you think about Rikku being an Al Bhed?"
Kimahri: "Ronso are followers of Yevon. Ronso dislike Al Bhed."
Tidus: "Oh, I get it."
Kimahri: "Not Kimarhi. Al Bhed are Al Bhed. Rikku is Rikku. Rikku
         swore to protect Yuna. And Rikku is not a liar. Kimarhi can
         tell. So, she is a friend."
Tidus: "You know, you might want to tell her that later. I think she
       needs to know that we still want her with us."
Kimahri: "Kimarhi is surprised."
Tidus: "Why?"
Kimahri: "Kimahri think you are kind. Uh, don't tell anyone, okay?"

[If Auron rides along:]

Tidus: "You're no fun to ride with at all."
Auron: "What?"
Tidus: "I'll take Kimarhi over you any day!"
Auron: "Hmph. Just don't do anything rash."
Tidus: "What's that mean?"
Auron: "I'm saying you should not complicate matters. Or you'll find
       yourself trapped, understand?"
Tidus: "I don't need you to tell me that! I guess there's some sense
       in what you're saying."
Auron: "Make mistakes. That's what youth is for after all. Do not
       waste it."
Tidus: "So which is it!?"

| 17) Macalania Temple                                          MCTM |
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

[The party walks to the temple, but a monk blocks the way when Rikku nears.]

Monk: "Halt! The likes of her are not welcome in this hallowed place."

Auron: "She is a guardian."

Monk: "An Al Bhed, a guardian? Preposterous!"

Rikku: "I've decided to be Yuna's guardian now, and that's all I want."

Auron: "And that's all one needs to be a guardian."

Monk: "Very well."

[Shelinda runs over once Tidus has run into the great hall.]

Shelinda: "Ah! There you are! So Lady Yuna is getting married. You shouldn't
          kid around about these things."

Tidus: "Yeah, I guess so."

Shelinda: "You're not happy?"

Tidus: "Nah, it's complicated."

[Tidus runs past her to the party.]

Tidus: "Say... Do you know where Yuna is?"

Shelinda: "I believe...she's gone to the Cloister of Trials with Maester
          Seymour."

[The party members run frantically to the Cloister entrance, which is blocked
by a monk. Just then, a woman runs out of the nuns' chambers.]

Nun: "Lord Jyscal! A sphere, in Lady Yuna's belongings..."

[The party runs into the nuns' chambers.]

Auron: "This may well answer a few questions."

[Tidus sets the sphere on the ground and it plays, a hologram of Jyscal coming
up in the recording.]

Jyscal: "What I am about to tell you is the unclouded truth. I swear it on my
        honor as a Guado. Listen to me very carefully, for I shall tell you the
        truth about my son, Seymour. His mind is closed even to me, a maester
        of Yevon. But I can feel flames of darkness burning in his heart. He is
        using Yevon, the Guado, and even the summoners. If he is not stopped,
        he will surely bring destruction and chaos to Spira. I will leave this
        world soon, killed by my own son. But I do not fault him. Because I was
        not wise enough, he has suffered, and become twisted. I could not
        protect him and his mother from the world and its cruelty. I will
        accept death as punishment for my deeds. But whoever is watching
        this... I implore you to stop Seymour! Stop my son."

[The recording ends.]

Auron: "Wonderful."

Rikku: "Will Yuna be all right?"

Auron: "Without us, no."

[Auron leaves the room.]

Wakka: "Where you goin'?"

Tidus: "You saw, didn't you? Seymour's bad news!"

Wakka: "But he's a maester!"

Tidus: "Fine! Stay here if you want!"

Lulu: "Come on, Wakka. Let's at least hear him out."

Wakka: "This can't be happening."

[Kimahri pushes the monk guarding the Cloister out of the way and the party
enters after Yuna.]

Auron: "Kimahri's up ahead. Go."

Tidus: "Right!"

[Wakka walks by Auron.]

Auron: "We will protect Yuna from anyone. Even a maester."

Wakka: "This can't be happening."

Lulu: "If he is truly at fault, it must be done."

[The party runs through the completed trials to the antechamber. Seymour and
his guardians are waiting for Yuna.]

Tidus: "Seymour!"

Seymour: "Please be silent. Lady Yuna prays to the fayth."

Tidus: "Make me."

[Seymour starts walking towards the party; Yuna stumbles out of the fayth.]

Tidus: "Yuna!"

Yuna: "But why...?"

Tidus: "We saw Jyscal's sphere."

Auron: "You killed him."

Seymour: "What of it? Lady Yuna, certainly you know of these things, did you
         not? Well then, why have you come here?"

Yuna: "I came... I came to stop you!"

Seymour: "I see. You came to punish me, then. What a pity. Ah, of course.
         'Protect the summoner even at the cost of one's life.' The Code of
         the Guardian. How admirable. Well, if you're offering your lives, I
         will have to take them."

Yuna; "Maester Seymour, I trust my guardians with my life. But they are also
      my friends. I will not stand by and watch them be hurt. I will fight
      you, too!"

Tidus: "All right!"

Wakka: "Maester Seymour!"

Seymour: "So be it."

[The party fights Seymour for awhile.]

Seymour: "Feel my pain! Come, Anima!"

[Anima's hideous aeon is summoned to battle.]

Tidus: "Yuna! The new aeon!"

Yuna: "O fayth, lend me strength!"

[Anima is defeated.]

Seymour: "That power that defeated Anima... It will be mine!"

[But it isn't -- Seymour gets smoked like a Guado cigarette. Yuna runs to him
as he's near death.]

Seymour: "Yuna...you would pity me now?"

[He dies, and Tromell enters.]

Tromell: "Lord Seymour! What happened here?"

Wakka: "What...what have I done?"

Tidus: "Wait a minute! It's not our fault at all! Seymour struck first! He's
       the bad guy!"

Tromell: "You did this?"

Auron: "Yuna. Send him."

Tromell: "No, stop! Stay away from him, traitors!"

[Two Guado monks carry Seymour's corpse out, not allowing it to be sent.
Tromell follows them out.]

Yuna: "Traitors?"

Wakka: "We're finished.

Tidus: "Now hold on just a minute! Seymour's the bad guy, right? We'll just
       explain to everyone what happened!"

Auron: "It won't be that easy... Let's get out of here."

[Shiva can be named at this point (default name for '????' aeon). The party
starts walking back through the finished Cloister of Trials, but the walkway
starts to disintegrate as they near the end.]

Tidus: "Gimme a break!"

[The party reworks the Cloister and heads back to the main hall. A bunch of
Guados and Tromell are there, staring at them.]

Yuna: "Please..."

Auron: "Give us a chance to explain."

Tromell: "No need, I already know what I'll tell the other maesters."

Auron: "Meaning...?"

Tromell: "Lord Seymour was the leader of the Guado before becoming a maester."

Tidus: "You're not letting us go."

Tromell: "Let you go? Lord Seymour would never forgive us if we did."

Rikku: "Wait, wait! Jyscal's sphere! We can show it to them!"

Tromell: "You mean this?"

[He holds up the sphere and crushes it.]

Tromell: "The Guado take care of Guado affairs."

Kimahri: "Away!"

Auron: "Run!"

[The party pushes past the Guado and beat it out of the temple. They run all
the way back to Lake Macalania, as fast as they can. Some Guado appear in
battle with them...and a huge four-armed ape of a boss. They defeat them all,
but the monster punches the frozen lake and cracks it, sending them plunging
to the bottom. They all land at the bottom, in what appears to be the ruins of
a city.]

T-Narrative: "Praise be to Yevon." That's what I would have said, if I was a
             follower of Yevon. We were all there, and in one piece. Even if I
             had a headache from wondering what was in store from us next.

[Tidus finds Rikku near Yuna.]

Rikku: "I'm sure Yunie's okay. She's breathing fine and all. How are Lulu and
       Wakka?"

Tidus: "Well, Wakka's in shock. Can't blame him, either. And Lulu, well, she's
       just the same as always."

Rikku: "She's so together. All grown up, I guess."

Tidus: "I guess."

Rikku: "Well, just give me five or six more years."

Tidus: "So, Kimahri, how do we get out of here?"

Rikku: "Hey, don't change the subject!"

Kimahri: "We climb."

Rikku: "Kimahri, too!"

Kimahri: "Only those who try will become."

Rikku: "Huh?"

Tidus: "I think he means you have to work hard if you want to be like Lulu."

Rikku: "Oh! I will!"

Kimahri: "Kimahri think Rikku should stay Rikku."

Rikku: "Hey! Are you saying I'll never be like Rikku! Kimahri!"

[Tidus laughs.]

Wakka: "How can you laugh at a time like this!?"

[Yuna wakes up.]

Tidus: "Yuna!"

[Later on, Yuna tells her motives for going to Seymour.]

Yuna: "I wanted to confront Maester Seymour about his father, Lord Jyscal. I
      wanted to convince him to turn himself into Yevon's judgement."

Lulu: "In exchange for marriage?"

Yuna: "Yes, if that's what it took."

Tidus: "So, what did Seymour say?"

Yuna: "He didn't say anything. Now...now I don't even think it was worth it. I
      should have told you what I was going to do."

Auron: "Enough. Dwelling in the past is futile."

Rikku: "Hey! You don't have to say it like that!"

Auron: "You want to waste time listening to her regrets?"

Rikku: "You don't have to say it like that."

Auron: "Our immediate concern is Yuna's pilgrimage. Are you willing to go on?"

Yuna: "Yes. But then, do you think Yevon will allow it?"

Auron: "The fayth are the ones that give power to the summoners. Not the
       temples or the teachings. If the temples try to stop us...then we will
       defy Yevon if we must."

Tidus: "Whoa!"
Rikku: "I can't believe you said that!"

Lulu: "Sir Auron!?"

Wakka: "Count me out. We have to atone, to make up for the sins we have
       committed. Of course...it's not like I ever liked Maester Seymour, ya?
       No way I'll ever forgive him for killing Lord Jyscal...and for trying to
       do us all in too, you know? But still, the bunch of us going against
       Yevon? No way!"

Lulu: "But still, we have transgressed and must face our punishment."

Yuna: "We must go to Bevelle. We must speak with Maester Mika and explain what
      has happened. There is no other way, I think."

Wakka: "I agree."

Yuna: "Sir Auron..."

Auron: "So it is decided."

Yuna: "Will you come with us?"

Auron: "I am the troublemaker, after all."

Tidus: "Yeah, that's right! You can always count on Auron to complicate
       things!"

Rikku: "Yeah! Kimahri roars, and Auron runs off, and..."

Auron: "I never asked you to follow me."

Tidus: "Hey, but that's what friends are for. Right?"

Rikku: "Yep!"

Yuna: "Thank you."

[Auron walks off.]

Rikku: "Friends, huh?"

Wakka: "Man... How can you all act like nothing's wrong? Must got nerves of
       steel or something."

Lulu: "You're too edgy. Listen to the hymn and calm down."'

[Later on, Tidus goes to Yuna. The Hymn is playing loudly.]

Tidus: "Is that coming from the temple?"

Yuna: "Yes, it is Yevon's gift. It sooths the hearts of the faithful."

[After talking to everyone, the fayth quit singing.]

Lulu: "The singing stopped."

[The ground shakes.]

Wakka: "There's something here!"

Auron: "The ground!"

[FMV. Sin is shown floating in the nearby, underneath the party presumably.]

Yuna: "Sin!?"

Lulu: "The toxin! Watch out!"

T-Narrative: It was then I knew...that Sin really was my old man. For the first
             time, I was finally able to believe it.

Tidus: "The song... You were listening, too! What is it this time?"

[Tidus is shown an image of Zanarkand's cityscape.]

Tidus: "Zanarkand... You homesick, too? That's not your world anymore. You're
       Sin now."

[Tidus is shown a memory of him, younger, sitting on the houseboat deck.]

Tidus: "Hey, I'm older now, you know? I know. You want this to end. I'll find
       a way. Promise."

[The image ends and Tidus loses track of where he is.]

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

[Tidus wakes up face-down in some water. He soon finds that it's an oasis, and
he's in the desert.]

Tidus: (Where am I? I forgive you, this time. Be good for a while, okay?)

[Tidus soon gets into a solo fight with a Zuu:]

Tidus: "Whew!"

Auron: "Need some help?"

[Auron appears.]

Lulu: "Are you alright?"

[Lulu joins the battle, too, and they defeat it together. After battle:]

Tidus: "The others?"

Lulu: "Haven't found them yet. We're supposed to stay in one place if we get
      split up."

Tidus: "Wait here if you want. He's not."

[Wakka is nearby, sheltered under a piece of machine.]

Tidus: "Wakka! You alone?"

Wakka: "Where's Yuna? Dammit! First I lose Yuna, then I'm ambushed by machina!
       Great day I'm having."

[Kimahri is by some dunes.]

Kimahri: "Yuna...gone."

Tidus: "It's not your fault, Kimahri!"

[Rikku is nearby, too.]

Rikku: "Oh! Hey, guys! Where's Yunie?"

Tidus: "Gone."

Lulu: "Gone... Some guardian I am."

Rikku: "Umm... There's something I wanna tell you, but promise not to say
       anything."

[Wakka glares at her.]

Rikku: "No glaring either! I know where we are. We're on Bikanel Island.
       There's a place us Al Bhed call Home near here. Yunie's there, I'm sure
       of it! Other Al Bhed must've come and rescued her!"

Wakka: "Rescued? You mean kidnapped!"

Tidus: "What does it matter as long as she's safe?"

Rikku: "That's right! Anyway, I will take you there if you promise...that you
       won't tell anyone about it. Especially not Yevonites, okay? You know
       they don't like us Al Bhed. Who knows what they'll do if they knew?"

Wakka: "Gimme a break. What are you accusing Yevon of this time?"

Rikku: "Yevon did something really bad to us before."

Wakka: "Well, you Al Bhed must've deserved it."

Tidus: "Can't you guys...talk about this later?"

Rikku: "Just promise you won't tell anyone about this island. Promise?"

Tidus: "Wakka, come on!"

Wakka: "All right, I promise! Lead the way."

Rikku: "You got it!"

[Rikku starts giving directions:]

Rikku: "That way!"
Rikku: "Uhh.. Which way was it again?
Rikku: "Over here!"
Rikku: "Umm...I think I'm lost."

[After awhile, the party finally makes it towards Home.]

Rikku: "Over here!"

[They walk to a hill and see Home...]

Rikku: "Aaaaaaa!"

Tidus: "Rikku!"

[...burning. Gunfire is audible.]

Wakka: "What? Yuna's down there?"

[The party runs into the Al Bhed firefight and looks around.]

Wakka: "Where's Yuna?"

[An Al Bhed nearby gets a gutshot and collapses. Rikku runs to him.]

Rikku: "Keyakku! Who? Who's attacking us? Fru tet drec du oui?"
       ["Keyakku! Who? Who's attacking us? Who did this to you?"]

Keyakku: "Yevon... Guado..."

[He dies.]

Rikku: "Keyakku? Keyakku!"

Lulu: "A war? Between Yevon and the Al Bhed?"

Voice: "Dryd ec fnuhk! Guado ku vun dra summoner." ["That is wrong! Guado
       go for the summoner."]

Rikku: "Vydran..." ["Father..."]

[A man walks over and stoops by Keyakku.]

Man: "You Rikku's friends? Well, just don't stand there, come on! Let's go
     kick those Guado out of our Home!"

[The party runs off except for Rikku and Tidus.]

Tidus: "Who...?"

Rikku: "Cid. Leader of the Al Bhed... He's my dad."

Tidus: "Let's go."

Rikku: "Yeah. We have to save Yunie."

Tidus: "Not only Yuna. Right?"

Rikku: "Right!"

[The party runs indoors.]

Wakka: "Yuna! Where are you?"

[A Bomb drops down and attacks, a Guado accompanying it.]

Wakka: "What in Yevon's name are those Guado thinking?"

Rikku: "This is terrible!"

[Everyone heads into a corridor. Cid is on a loudspeaker somewhere.]

Cid: "Drec pedac! Rikku! Oui nayt sa? Oui ku ihtan, duu! E ys majamehk Home!
     Yht dra fiend fedr ed!" ["This bites! Rikku! You read me? You go under,
     too! I am leveling Home! And the fiend with it!"]

Rikku: "Oh, no!"

Wakka: "What'd he say!?"

Rikku: "We have to get underground!"

Auron: "Where's Yuna?"

Rikku: "The Summoners' Sanctum! This way!"

[A Guado and some Dual Horns attack, but they get beaten back.]

Rikku: "Over here!"

[Everyone runs to the room nearby.]

Wakka: "This place done for."

Rikku: "You're right. You're right, Wakka. We Al Bhed, we...we weren't always
       like this. Sin destroyed the island where we all used to live. After
       that, we were scattered to every corner of Spira. But then, my dad
       brought the Al Bhed together again. If we few put our minds to it and
       worked together, then we could make a new home. Everyone worked hard,
       we had our Home back again... But now... Why did things have to turn out
       this way?"

Wakka: "Rikku... Damn those Guado! What are they thinking?"

[The party kills some baddies and moves on.]

Lulu: "Rikku, what is the Summoners' Sanctum?"

Rikku: "The Summoners' Sanctum is where we keep the summoners. We keep them
       safe there."

Wakka: "You kidnapped them."

Rikku: "I know it's against the teachings and all that..."

Wakka: "I get why you did it, but..."

Tidus: "Well, I sure don't get it, Wakka. They might get hurt on their
       pilgrimage so you kidnap them? I mean, if the summoners don't do their
       job, then who will beat Sin? You want to protect them, I know. But
       guardians are there for that. If guardians do their job well, summoners
       will be safe! Right? Right!?"

Kimahri: "It's quiet. Kimahri goes now."

[The party goes to the Sanctum.]

Rikku: "Yuna, please be here!"

Kimahri: Yuna!

[A Barthello-less Dona walks over.]

Dona: "She's not here. Hello again. Wait there until we have performed the
      sending."

Isaaru: "They died...protecting us. It's not much, but the least we can do is
        give them a proper sending."

[The two start to do a sending. Pacce runs over to Tidus.]

Pacce: "Hey, what's "sacrificed"? The Al Bhed said summoners were being
       'sacrificed.' That summoners shouldn't have to do a pilgrimage..."

Tidus: "Why couldn't they trust guardians to protect the summoners? The Al
       Bhed had no right stopping their pilgrimage!"

Rikku: "The pilgrimages have to stop! If they don't, and they get to
       Zanarkand... They might defeat Sin. Yunie could...but then she... Yunie
       will die, you know? You know, don't you? Summoners journey to get the
       Final Aeon. Yuna told you, didn't she? With the Final Aeon, she can beat
       Sin. But then...but then... If she calls it, the Final Aeon's going to
       kill her! Even if she defeats Sin, it will kill Yunie too, you know!"

Tidus: "Was I the only one who didn't know? Tell me why! Why were you hiding
       it? Why didn't I know?"

Wakka: "We weren't hiding it..."

Lulu: "It was just...too hard to say."

Tidus: "Lulu! How could you? How could you? Isn't she like a sister to you? I
       thought you were family! Why don't you do something, Wakka?"

Lulu: "Don't you think we tried to stop her? She follows...her heart."

Wakka: "Yuna, she knew what she was doing when she chose to become a summoner.
       To face Sin, ya? Yuna knew!

Rikku: "But Wakka, that's just totally wrong! Summoners shouldn't have to
       sacrifice themselves...just so the rest of Spira can be happy, right?"

[A large ape-monster appears. Issaru and Dona walk over.]

Isaaru: "But that is our choice..."

Dona: "We all live in fear of Sin. You know that."

Isaaru: "A world without Sin... That is the dream of all Yevon's children.
        And we will use that power, even if it means our lives!

[Summoned aeons start to appear. Tidus runs to Valefor, punching its stomach.]

Tidus: "And I've been telling Yuna... Let's go to Zanarkand together! Let's
       beat Sin! I told her all the things we could...we could... And all
       along, the whole time, I didn't know anything! But Yuna, she'd...just
       smile."

[Flashback to Luca, after Auron's joined.]

Yuna: "Hey, watch!"

[She whistles.]

Tidus: "Hey, you got pretty good."

Yuna: "You sound sad."

Tidus: "Yeah, maybe."

Yuna: "Wanna scream?"

Tidus: "I really don't think that's gonna help this time."

Yuna: "You know what? It's embarrassing to say this myself... But summoners
      and their guardians are kind of like Spira's ray of light. A lot of
      people in Spira depend on us. I learned to practice smiling when I'm sad,
      you know? I know it's hard."

Tidus: "Yeah...I understand, I think."

Yuna: "Right. Now, let's see what you can do!"

[Fast-forward to the laughing scene, muted.]

Yuna: "I want my journey to be full of laughter."

[The flashback ends.]

Tidus: "I can't let her die! I'll find her!"

[The summoners escape with the guardians to the underground airship dock. They
board the airship. Cid runs into the control room.]

Cid: "Hu desa! Ku, ku, ku!" ["No time! Go, go go!"]

Brother: "Three minutes mavd!" ["Three minutes left!"]

Cid: "Rinno, rinno! Oui ryja one minute!" ["Hurry, hurry! You have one
     minute!"]

Tidus: "Where's Yuna?"

Cid: "Ajanouha uh puynt?" ["Everyone on board?"]

Al Bhed: "Ajanouha ymeja!" ["Everyone alive!"]

Tidus: "I said, where is she?" Answer me! Answer me, damn you!"

Cid: "What'll you do when you find her, eh?"

Tidus: "I didn't know anything about what a summoner is supposed to do. And I
       told her all those things without even knowing. I've got to tell her!
       I've got to tell her I'm sorry!"

Cid: "That's it? You're gonna tell her you're sorry? And then you just drag
     her to Zanarkand and make her fight Sin, huh? You're all the same -- let
     the summoner die so we can live in peace!"

Tidus: "No! I'm not gonna let Yuna die!"

Cid: "Hah! Words! Show me action!"

Tidus: "I'm telling you, she won't die!"

Cid: "Boy, don't forget those words, 'cause if you do...I'm gonna make you
     regret it."

Tidus: "I won't. So you know where she is?"

Cid: "'Course not. That's why we're gonna look! Using this airship!"

Wakka: "A-Airship?"

[The airship rumbles.]

Brother: "Vydran! Nayto du ku!" ["Father! Ready to go!"]

Cid: "Oaaryy! Y vmekrd 1000 years ujantia!" ["Yeehaa! A flight 1000 years
     overdue!"]

[FMV. The airship dock opens and the airship flies out.]

Brother: "Fruy! Ed sujac!" ["Whoa! It moves!"]

Cid: "Necg pek, feh pek!" ["Risk big, win big!"]

[FMV. The airship starts to fly away.]

Brother: "Fruy! Ed vmeac!" ["Whoa! It flies!"]

Cid: "Haqd, fa ica dryd!" ["Next, we use that!"]

Brother: "Frydajan oui cyo." ["Whatever you say."]

[The crewmembers all start singing the Hymn.]

Wakka: "What's goin' on?"

Rikku: "We're...we're going to blow up our Home."

Lulu: "How?"

Cid: "With one of the forbidden machina! Nayto? Vena!" ["With one of the
     forbidden machina! Ready? Fire!"]

[FMV. The ship shoots missile salvoes at Home, destroying it and a large
portion of the island too, by the look of the shockwave that accompanies the
explosion. The ship makes it out intact.]

Cid: "Gah-hah-hah-hah! Nadinh du cyht!" ["Gah-hah-hah-hah! Return to sand!"]

[Brother is crying.]

Cid: "Hu haat vun daync! Fryd ec kuut ypuid machina, ec drao lyh pa piemd
     yhaf, oui caa?" ["No need for tears! What is good about machina, is they
     can be build anew, you see?"]

[Wakka stands by Rikku.]

Wakka: "Hey, look. Don't get so down. Boom! Like happy festival fireworks, ya?"

Rikku: "You can cram your happy festival, you big meanie!"

[Tidus walks around for awhile before returning to the bridge. He comes upon
Auron talking to Cid.]

Auron: "After rescuing Yuna, then what? You want to keep her safe, correct?
       Would you seek to stop her pilgrimage?"

Cid: "Of course! If she continues this fool pilgrimage, she will die! Sure as
     if you killed her yourself. No hare-brained law or teaching can send my
     little niece to her death! When I save her, I'll make her give up being
     a summoner quicker than a desert melts ice!"

Auron: "Even against her will?"

Cid: "Better than a dog's death! And I'll take down anyone who don't agree!"

[Tidus goes over to Brother.]

Brother: "Vydran! Fa vuiht Yuna!" ["Father! We found Yuna!"]

Cid: "Frana!?" ["Where!?"]

Brother: "E femm cruf oui!" ["I will show you!"]

Tidus: "Yuna?"

[The screen shows Yuna dressed in a wedding gown with Seymour (!?) by her
side. They appear to be in...]

Tidus: "Where was that!?"

Lulu: "The Palace of St. Bevelle. Heart of Yevon."

Tidus: "Gramps, let's move!"

Cid: "Easy, kiddo. Bevelle's defenses are top-notch."

Tidus: "What's the matter, gramps? You scared? Yuna's there, so we go and get
       her! And that's all!"

Cid: "You got guts. Cad luinca du Bevelle! Vimm cbaat yrayt!" ["You got
     guts. Set course to Bevelle! Full speed ahead!"]

Brother: "Nukan!" ["Roger!"]

[The ship blasts off.]

Cid: "It'll take a while to get to Bevelle. Meanwhile..."

Tidus: "We prepare for battle!"

[The ship shakes. Rin runs in.]

Rin: "We're being attacked from within. Some of the Guado that attacked Home
     must have snuck on board."

Cid: "You're awfully calm about it!"

Rin: "I am calm about most things."

Cid: "Fiends! There's nothing to do but--"

[Rikku interjects, in a cowboy drawl:]

Rikku: "But destroy the ship and all go down together!"

[Cid looks at her sideways.]

Rikku: "You gotta learn a little restraint, Pop. If you crash the ship, we
       can't go rescue Yunie! Leave the fiends to us professionals!"

Tidus: "Yeah! Let's go!"

Rikku: "Thanks."

Rin: "Rikku, you've made some very good friends, I think. Good luck."

[The party goes to the upper airship cabin and sees a large fiend flying
parallel to the airship.]

Auron: "Huh, now there's a rare sight."

Tidus: "Whoa, that's huge!"

Rikku: "What is that?"

Lulu: "The guardian wyrm, Evrae. The great sacred beast -- protector of
      Bevelle!"

Auron: "The red carpet has teeth."

Tidus: "Wait, that means we're close to Bevelle!"

[Cid's voice booms on the loudspeaker.]

Cid: "Rikku, you read me? We're gonna fight that thing! Get on deck and show
     him what you got! Go!"

Rikku: "There he goes again."

Auron: "The ferryman asks a high price."

[The party sees Rin by the entrance to the top deck.]

Auron: "Open the hatch. We fight."

Rin: "Evrae is truly mighty. Be well prepared." [Got any weapons?/Got any
     items?/Leave.]

Wakka: "We gotta pay!? If we lose, you'll die too, buddy!"

Rin: "I have faith in your victory."

Wakka: "Gee, thanks."

[The party goes up out into the sun, seeing Evrae flying right nearby. Cid
opens protectors to the forbidden machina salvoes.]

Cid: "We gotta keep our distance, boys, but we can't let her get too far away.
     You all have to tell me when to move! But tell me quick, eh? This rig
     ain't so nible, you hear?"

Tidus: "Roger! I'll give the commands!"

Rikku: "Not alone, you won't!"

Narrative: [Maneuvering the Airship]

           Use the trigger commands Move in and Pull back to adjust the
           distance between the airship and Evrae. Only Tidus and Rikku can
           give these orders. Give an order and Cid will move the airship on
           his next turn. To cancel an order, use the Cancel command before
           Cid takes his turn.

[The party kills Evrae, and its disintegrating hide falls down to earth.]

Brother: "Cruud! Fa'na mucehk bufan!" ["Shoot! We're losing power!"]

Cid: "Rao! E caa Bevelle!" ["Hey! I see Bevelle!"]

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

[FMV. The airship barrels towards Bevelle, the party on-deck clinging on for
dear life. The wedding ceremony is almost in full-swing, too. The unsent
Seymour and Yuna walk up the steps to the altar, together, although she doesn't
look extremely pleased. Maester Kinoc looks up into the sky and sees pyreflies
descending, knowing that Evrae is no more.]

[FMV. The airship attacks.]

Kinoc: "Fire!"

[Seymour grabs Yuna's hand.]

Seymour: "Come."

[FMV. The party grinds down two metal lines anchored into the pavement. They
jump off just as the gunfire snaps the lines free.]

Tidus: "Yuna!"

[The party cuts swathing path through the warrior monks. Kinoc flashes a gun.]

Kinoc: "This has gone far enough!"

[Auron holds Tidus back.]

Auron: "Stop!"

[Monks surround the party. Yuna stands in front of Seymour, rod ready to send
her undead husband-to-be to the Farplane.]

Seymour: "You would play at marriage just for a chance to send me? Your
         resolve is admirable. All the more fitting to be my lovely wife."

[Yuna starts to send him.]

Mika: "Stop! Do you not value your friends' lives? Your actions determine
      their fate. Protect them...or throw them away. The choice is yours."

[Yuna throws her rod down.]

Seymour: "You are wise."

[FMV. Seymour kisses Yuna, much to the chagrin of her party.]

Seymour: "Kill them."

[Kinoc points his gun at Tidus' face.]

Kinoc: "I am sorry, but it is for Yevon."

Auron: "Aren't those weapons forbidden by Yevon?"

Kinoc: "There are exceptions."

Yuna: "No!"

[Yuna stands on the Tower of Light's ledge.]

Yuna: "Throw down your weapons! Let them go, or else..."

[Seymour makes the soldiers, Kinoc included, drop their weapons.]

Yuna: "Leave now! Please!"

Tidus: "You're coming with us!"

Yuna: "Don't worry! Go!"

Seymour: "This is foolish. If you fall, you'll die."

Yuna: "Don't worry. I can fly. Believe."

[Yuna falls backwards off the ledge.]

Tidus: Yuna!

[FMV. Yuna summons Valefor mid-fall and it catches her.]

Rikku: "Cover your eyes!"

[Rikku throws a flashbang at Seymour, who looks at it stupidly as it explodes.
The party makes their escape.]

Wakka: "Wh-What was that?"

Rikku: "An Al Bhed flashbomb!"

Tidus: "Lemme go! I'm gonna kill that Seymour!"

Kimahri: "Yuna said leave! We leave!"

Lulu: "We'll join up with her later!"

Auron: "Break through!"

[The party runs to the entrance to the Tower of Light.]

Rikku: "Where'd Yunie go?"

Kimahri: "Bevelle Palace is temple. Yuna goes to one place only."

Tidus: "The Chamber of the Fayth!"

[The party walks into the next room.]

Lulu: "It's too quiet. A trap?"

Tidus: "Who cares? Yuna's waiting for us!"

Rikku: "Huh?"

[Rikku goes to an electronic control panel and fiddles with it.]

Wakka: "What's a machina doing in the temple?"

Rikku: "I suppose it comes in handy."

Wakka: "That's not what I mean! The teachings! What about the teachings?"

Rikku: "Hey, don't look at me!"

[The party takes the machina down to a lower level. Rikku finds another panel.]

Wakka: "Another machina? Man..."

Auron: "So this is Yevon's true face. They betray their own teachings."

Wakka: "They treated us like dirt."

[In the next room, the party finds...]

Lulu: "The entrance to the Trials."

Rikku: "I wonder if Yunie's really in there."

Wakka: "Let's go and see!"

Lulu: "Let's go!"

[They make it through the Trials and come to the Bevelle antechamber.]

Tidus: "Yuna?"

Wakka: "Inside, maybe?"

Tidus: "Then what are we standing here for?"

[Tidus tries lifting the heavy drop-down door to the Chamber.]

Wakka: "H-Hey!"

Tidus: "You can stuff your taboos!"

[Kimahri helps him lift the door, and Tidus rolls underneath. In the Chamber,
Yuna sits praying. A figure of a boy (the 'Strange Boy' from Zanarkand, to be
precise) is there in front of Yuna.]

Tidus: "Wh-What's that?"

Auron: "A fayth. They join with the summoner and together receive the aeon.
       They are human souls, imprisoned in stone by ancient Yevon rites. The
       dead should be allowed to rest.

[The fayth joins with Yuna in front of the two, and she collapses.]

Tidus: "Yuna!"

[Tidus picks her up and starts to carry her out.]

Rikku: "Wait, don't come out!"

[Outside, Tidus can see Kinoc and some monks.]

Kinoc: "There's the last of them. You are to stand trial."

Auron: "I expect it will be a fair trial."

Kinoc: "Of course it will."

[The guards seize the party, and the player can name Yuna's new aeon, default
Bahamut. Soon, court is in session.]

Kelk Ronso: "The High Court of Yevon is now in session. The sacred offices of
            this court seek nothing but absolute truth, in Yevon's name. To
            those on trial: Believe in Yevon, and speak only the truth."

Lulu: "Maester Kelk Ronso."

Kelk: "Summoner Yuna. You have sworn to protec the people of Yevon, true?"

Yuna: "Yes."

Kelk: "Then, consider: You have inflicted dire injury upon Maester Seymour
      Guado...conspired with the Al Bhed and joined in their insurrection.
      These are traitorous and unforgivable crimes that disturb the order of
      Yevon. Tell this court what possessed you to participate in such
      violence."

Yuna: "Your Grace... The real traitor is Maester Seymour! He killed his father
      Jyscal with his own hands!"

Kelk: "What is this!"

Seymour: "Hmm? Hadn't you heard?"

Yuna: "Not only that... Maester Seymour is already dead!"

Lulu: "It is a summoner's sacred duty to send the souls of the departed to
      the Farplane! Yuna was only doing her job as a summoner!"

Yuna: "Grand Maester Mika... Please, send Seymour now!"

Mika: "Send the unsent to where they belong?"

Yuna: "Yes!"

[He chuckles.]

Yuna: "Maester?"

Mika: "Send the dead...hmm?"

[Pyreflies come out of Mika.]

Mika: "You would have to send me, too."

Wakka: "What!"

Kelk: "Grand Maester Mika is a wise leader. Even in death, he is invaluable
      to Spira."

Kinoc: "Enlightened rule by the dead is preferable to the misguided failures
       of the living."

Seymour: "Life is but a passing dream, but the death that follows is eternal."

Mika: "Men die. Beasts die. Trees die. Even continents perish. Only the power
      of death truly commands in Spira. Resisting its power is futile."

Yuna: "But what of Sin? I am a summoner, my lord, like my father before me! I
      am on a pilgrimage to stop the death that Sin brings. Are you... Are you
      telling me that, too, is futile? Grand Maester Mika, I am not alone! All
      the people who have opposed Sin... Their battles, their sacrifices --
      were they all in vain?"

Mika: "Not in vain. No matter how many summoners give their lives, Sin cannot
      be truly defeated. The rebirth cannot be stopped. Yet the courage of
      those who fight gives the people hope. There is nothing futile in the
      life and death of a summoner."

Auron: "Never futile...but never ending."

Mika: "Indeed, that is the essence of Yevon."

Yuna: "Lord Mika!"

Mika: "Yevon is embodied by eternal, unchanging continuity, summoner."

Yuna: "No...that can't be right!"

Mika: "Those who question these truths -- they are traitors!"

Yuna: "Lord Mika!"

[Later on, after court's adjourned, Auron and Tidus are held captive in a
hanging cage.]

Tidus: "Get me outta here! I want out now! You hear me?"

Auron: "You waste your breath."

Tidus: "Man, I hope Yuna's okay."

Auron: "She's strong. She'll make it."

Tidus: "She'll make it? What, so she can die? Why is it...everything in Spira
       seems to revolve around people dying?"

Auron: "Ahh, the spiral of death."

Tidus: "Huh?"

Auron: "Summoners challenge the bringer of death, Sin, and die doing so.
       Guardians give their lives to protect their summoner. The fayth are
       the souls of the dead. Even the maesters of Yevon are unsent. Spira is
       full of death. Only Sin is reborn, and then only to bring more death.
       It is a cycle of death, spiraling endlessly."

[Kinoc walks by the cage.]

Kinoc: "Come out. Your sentence has been decided."

Auron: "Sentence? Don't you mean execution?"

Kinoc: "Really, now, what person would execute a dear friend?"

Auron: "You would."

[Later on, Tidus stands by some indoor pool, a gun barrel on his back.]

Warrior Monk: "Looks like you're next!"

Tidus: "Next for what?"

[The monk pushes him into the water.]

Warrior Monk: "Get going!"

Tidus: "Where's everybody else?"

Warrior: "Floating down there somewhere, maybe."

[Tidus finds Wakka after swimming down some water channels.]

Wakka: "Oooh! You made it!

[Rikku swims over.]

Tidus: "What's our sentence?"

Wakka: "Think they expect us to give up and die down here."

Tidus: "Well, that's a lame way to kill someone."

Rikku: "Where's Yunie?"

Tidus: "I don't know."

Rikku: "Wonder if we should wait for her..."

Tidus: "Hmm... Let's wait at the exit."

Rikku: "If there is an exit."

[Somewhere, Seymour, Kinoc, and Mika are conversing.]

Mika: "How fares the Ronso maester?"

Seymour: "It seems my father's murder troubles him."

Mika: "Ever the Ronso. Hard-headed, hardly useful."

Seymour: "However... The summoner Yuna, daughter to High Summoner Braska...
         She may be of some use to us alive."

Mika: "She has disturbed the order of Yevon. She cannot be allowed to live."

Seymour: "I understand."

Kinoc: "Let it go, Seymour. No one thrown into the Via Purifico has ever
       survived."

Mika: "Yet, there is always a small chance that they might. Place guards at
      the exit. Kill any who emerge."

Seymour: "Sir. Leave that to me."

Mika: "First your father, now your bride?"

Seymour: "Allow me to do this because she is my bride."

Kinoc: "Wait. I will go, too."

Seymour: "You do not trust me?"

Kinoc: "Would you trust a man who murdered his father?"

Seymour: "Very well. As you wish."

[The scene ends. Somewhere, Isaaru's voice says:]

Isaaru: "Lady Yuna, forgive me."

[Lady Yuna is shown in the Via Purifico when the scene comes back on.]

Narrative: [To the condemned:]

           Stone panels are scattered throughout the Via Purifico. Step on one
           to transport yourself to the next panel in the indicated direction.
           Nothing will happen if there is no panel to receive you at the far
           end.

[Yuna finds Auron imprisoned within the maze.]

Auron: "There must be an exit somewhere. We search!"

[Isaaru is at the exit, waiting for Yuna.]

Isaaru: "Lady Yuna... So it is you!"

Yuna: "Why are you here?"

Isaaru: "We rode the airship to the Calm Lands, then came to Bevelle. Maester
        Kinoc summoned us then. Ordered us to 'deal with the traitors.'"

Auron: "You will fight us?"

Isaaru: "The temple's orders are law. Even if you are Lord Braska's flesh and
        blood... You're a traitor! Forgive me, Lady Yuna."

[The two have an aeon fight, Isaaru saying with each summon:]

Isaaru: "Your aeons against mine!"
Isaaru: "It's not over yet!"
Isaaru: "I cannot let you pass!"

[Yuna wallops Isaaru's aeons.]

Isaaru: "Stay away! There's a way to the surface up ahead."

[Yuna leaves, and Auron walks to Isaaru, delivering the line:]

Auron: "Your pilgrimage is over."

[Tidus' party goes through the 'water course' of Via Purifico and comes out on
dry land. They meet up with the rest.]

Rikku: "Yunie! You're all right? We were so worried! It's good to have you
       back!"

Yuna: "Thank you."

Tidus: "Um... I...uh..."

[Behind him, Seymour, Kinoc, and some Guado appear. Although, Kinoc isn't
walking -- he's being carried by his collar, because he's been killed.]

Auron: "Kinoc!"

Tidus: "Why, you!"

Seymour: "I have saved him. He was a man who craved power. And great power he
         had, but he feared losing it. Trembling at unseen enemies, he spent
         his days scheming petty schemes. Chased by his fears, never knowing
         rest. You see... Now, he has no worries. He has been granted sleep
         eternal. Death is a sweet slumber. All the pain of life is gently
         swept away... Ah, yes. So you see...if all life were to end on Spira,
         all suffering would end. Don't you see? Do you not agree? That, Yuna,
         is why I need you. Come, Lady Yuna. Come with me to Zanarkand, the
         lost city of the dead. With death on our side, we will save Spira, and
         for this...I will take from you your strength, Yuna, your life, and
         become the next Sin. I will destroy Spira! I will save it!"

Tidus: "You're totally nuts!"

[Kimahri brandishes his spear.]

Seymour: "Unpleasant... Very well. I will give you your death. You seem to
         want it so."

[Seymour turns his entourage and Kinoc into pyrelifes, absorbs them, and turns
into an ugly monster.]

Kimahri: "Run! Protect Yuna!"

Auron: "Go!"

Tidus: "No way! I'm fighting!"

Auron: "I said go!"

[The party starts to leave Kimahri to Seymour.]

Yuna: "I won't leave Kimahri behind!"

Auron: "He is a guardian. Protecting you is everything."

Yuna: "Auron!"

Tidus: "That's right! We're all guardians! Yeah, and you know what that means?
       Yuna... Anywhere you go, I'll follow!"

Yuna: "Anywhere I go?"

Tidus: "Yeah, anywhere!"

Yuna: "Well, then!"

Tidus & Yuna: "Let's go!

Tidus: "Hey, Kimahri! Leave some for us!"

Wakka: "Hey! Wait for me!"

Rikku: "Me, too!"

Lulu: "I'll go, too!"

[Everyone runs back to fight Seymour and wallops him.]

T-Narrative: We escaped with our skins intact, but Yuna lost something. I could
             already tell, her faith was shaken. Yevon had betrayed her. I felt
             like I should do or say something -- anything... But nothing came.
             I was just as lost as she was. And then..."

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

[After escaping Bevelle, Wakka, Lulu, Rikku and Tidus are resting in a dark
area. Auron walks over.]

Wakka: "Well?"

Auron: "We're all clear. We will have to avoid Bevelle in the future. Yuna?"

Rikku: "Said she wanted to be alone."

Auron: "Of course."

[Tidus finds Yuna by a spring.]

Yuna: "I always thought that this would be easier somehow. I thought that
      everyone would help me...with all my friends together beside me. I've
      been trying so hard."

Tidus: "Maybe you're trying too hard. They told me...everything."

Yuna: "Everything? Well, so then...you know."

Tidus: "Yeah. I'm sorry. It's just you know...all those things I said. Like
       'Let's go get Sin!' Or about Zanarkand... I didn't know what would
       happen to you, Yuna. I guess...I hope it didn't make you sad. Forgive
       me."

Yuna: "I wasn't sad. I was happy."

[Tidus swims around in the water.]

Tidus: "Yuna. Just don't do it."

Yuna: "The pilgrimage?"

Tidus: "Yeah. That's right. Forget all about Sin, about being a summoner.
       Forget all that. You know, live a normal life. Come on now, Yuna,
       what do you say?"

Yuna: "Maybe I will. Wouldn't everyone be surprised?"

Tidus: Yeah. Except Rikku. She'd be with you. Lulu and Wakka wouldn't hold
       out long."

Yuna: "Kimahri would say yes, too, I know. But Sir Auron..."

Tidus: "I'll make him understand, Yuna. It's the least I can do for you."

Yuna: "No, I should tell him. He deserves it. What'll I do if I give up my
      pilgrimage?"

Tidus: "Hey! Zanarkand! Let's go to Zanarkand! Not the one in Spira, the one
       I'm from. Yeah, we can all fly there. Everyone can go! Then we'll have
       a big party at my place!"

Yuna: "And then we could see blitzball! Your Zanarkand Abes would play! We
      could all watch you play, in the stadium all lit up at night. I'd cheer
      and cheer till I couldn't cheer anymore!"

Tidus: "Right on!"

Yuna: "Well, what about after the game?"

Tidus: "We'd go out and have fun!"

Yuna: "In the middle of the night?"

Tidus: "No problem! Zanarkand never sleeps! Let's go to the sea, before the
       sunrise. The city lights go out one by one. The star fade... Then the
       horizon glows, almost like it's on fire. It's kinda rose-colored,
       right? First in the sea, then it spreads to the sky, then to the whole
       city. It gets brighter and brighter, till everything glows. It's
       really...pretty. I know you'd like it."

Yuna: "I'd like to see it, someday."

Tidus: "Well you can, Yuna. We can both go!"

[Yuna starts to weep.]

Tidus: "Yu...?"

Yuna: "I can't. I just can't! I can't go!"

[FMV. Yuna weeps.]

Tidus: "Yuna."

[FMV. Tidus kisses Yuna and they embrace underwater. They go sit on the
shore when they're done.]

Yuna: "I'll continue. I must. If I give up now... I could do anything I
      wanted to, and yet... Even if I was with you, I could never forget."

Tidus: "I'll go with you. I'm your guardian. Unless I'm...fired?"

Yuna: "Stay with me until the end. Please."

Tidus: "Not until the end... Always."

Yuna: "Always, then."

Yuna: "Maybe you should head back to camp first."

Tidus: "Roger!"

Yuna: "Wait. I'll go with you."

[The two head back to the campsite together.]

Yuna: "Sir Auron? Wakka? Lulu? Kimahri? Rikku? Everyone, we leave at dawn.
      And...I'm sorry for putting you all through this. And...um..."

Auron: "Enough. You need your rest."

Yuna: "Yes. Good night."

[The next morning, the party heads out for the Calm Lands.]

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
| 22) The Calm Lands                                            TCLS |
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

[The party walks out of the dark forest into the bright sunlight. As they
come over a hill, they see the entirety of the Calm Lands spread out before
them. It's...a huge plain, bigger than any space so far.]

Lulu: "The Calm Lands. Long ago, the high summoners fought Sin here. The road
      ends here. Beyond, there're no towns, no villages. Only endless plains."

Auron: "Many summoners stray from their path and lose their way here."

[Yuna sprawls out on the grass.]

Yuna: "I've always known where to go."

Tidus: "I... I won't let you die. I'll find a way, somehow."

Yuna: "Let's go."

T-Narrative: I told Yuna I would find a way. I guess I wanted to believe that
             words could make it come true.

[The party walks through the Calm Lands towards Mt. Gagazet. At the foot of
the mountain--]

Voice: "Halt!"

[Some Guado emerge from a hiding place.]

Guado: "Summons from Lord Seymour! Come with us."

Yuna: "We have nothing to discuss with Maester Seymour!"

Tidus: "Yeah, so out of our way!"

Guado: "Lord Seymour's commands must be obeyed. You will come! I warn you, the
       maester doesn't need you alive."

[A giant robot machina walks up from under the bridge nearby and attacks the
party. They defeat it and walk across the bridge to the entrance up to the
mountain.]

T-Narrative: Sometimes Yuna would just stare off into the distance. I finally
             understood why. She was saying goodbye to the places she'd never
             see again.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
| 23) Mount Gagazet                                             MTGZ |
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

[The party walks onto the mountain's base. Kimahri looks around and sees Biran
lunging towards him from above; he barely dodges. Down the path, Kelk Ronso
also appears.]

Kelk: "Summoner Yuna and guardians, leave here at once!"

[The party looks around and sees many Ronso standing on the cliffsides,
towering over them.]

Kelk: "Gagazet is Ronso land, sacred mountain of Yevon. The mountain will not
      bear the footsteps of infidels!"

Biran: "Enemy of Yevon is enemy of Ronso! Leave, traitors!"

Yuna: "I have cast aside Yevon! I follow the temple no more!"

Kelk: "Then you will die by those words!"

Yuna: "So be it. Yevon has warped the teachings and betrayed us all!"

Wakka: "Nothing but a bunch of low-down tricksters, eh?"

Tidus: "Yeah! Yeah!"

Rikku: "Yeah! Yeah!"

Yuna: "We have no regrets."

Yenke: "Blasphemers!

Kelk: "A summoners and her guardians..."

Lulu: "Lord Kelk Ronso, if I may. Have you not also turned your back on
      Bevelle?"

Auron: "But still, you guard Gagazet as a Ronso, not a maester. Yuna is much
       the same."

Biran: "Elder Kelk! Let Biran rend them asunder!"

Yenke: "No escape! Not one!"

Yuna: "No, we will not flee. We will fight, and continue on."

Kelk: "You have been branded a traitor, but still you would fight Sin? Lost
      to the temple, hated the people, yet you continue your pilgrimage?
      Everything lost! What do you fight for?"

Yuna: "I fight for Spira. The people long for the Calm. I can give it to them.
      It's all I can give. Defeating Sin, ending pain...this I can do."

Kelk: "Even sacrificing yourself? Ronso, let them pass! Summoner Yuna, your
      will is stronger than steel. Tempered steel that even the mightiest Ronso
      could not hope to bend. Yuna, we bow to your will! Now go! The sacred
      heights of Gagazet welcome you."

Yuna: "We thank you."

[The party starts to climb up the mountain, but--]

Biran: "Halt!"

[Biran and Yenke show themselves.]

Tidus: "Haven't you bothered us enough?"

Biran: "Summoner may pass. Guardians may pass. Kimahri not pass! Kimahri shame
       Ronso brothers. Kimahri forget his birth."

Yenke: "Forget his people, forget his mountain. Little Ronso! Weakling Ronso!"

Biran: "Mountain hate the weak, hate the small. If you will climb..."

Kimahri: "Then I must prove my strength!"

Biran: "Think you will win? You not forget who took your horn! Never forget!"

Yenke: "Kimahri never beat brother Biran! Never win!"

Kimahri: "This time, I win. I will win!"

Tidus: "This some kind of Ronso thing?"

Kimahri: "Kimahri problem."

[Kimahri squares off against Biran and Yenke and beats them.]

Biran: "Strong is Kimahri. Biran is happy. Sacred Mount Gagazet! I honor the
       name of the warrior who defeats Biran. Remember always, Gagazet! That
       name is Kimahri!"

Yenke: "Mountain knows Kimahri strong. Kimahri may pass."

Biran: "Summoner! We Ronso will stop pursuers from temple."

Yuna: "Truly?"

Biran: "Penance for breaking Kimahri's horn, long ago."

Yenke: "We crush enemies following behind."

Kimahri: "Kimahri crush enemies standing before."

Biran: "You are most fortunate summoner."

Yuna: "I thank you."

Yenke: "Ronso will shine your statue brightest."

Yuna: "Thank you. But I fear that no one will make a statue for a traitor such
      as I am."

Biran: "Then Ronso will make!"

Yenke: "With grand horn on head!"

Yuna: "That...would be wonderful."

[Biran and Yenke allow the party to pass, and the party starts to walk on.]

T-Narrative: I wanted to see Yuna's statue, too. But I wanted to see it...with
             Yuna by my side.

[Biran stands on a cliff.]

Biran: "Summoner Yuna!"

Tidus: "What is it this time?"

[Biran and Yenke starts to sing the Hymn of the Fayth. More Ronso join in...
It's a funny scene, kinda, with their posturing. The party heads up the mount;
Rikku and Tidus stop to talk.]

Rikku: "Zanarkand is on the other side, you know?"

Tidus: "I know."

Rikku: "Yunie is gonna get the Final Aeon, you know?"

Tidus: "I know."

Rikku: "I still haven't thought of anything."

Tidus: "Me neither."

Rikku: "What are we gonna do?"

Tidus: "We'll do something! We just don't know enough yet. Until we do, we
       really can't help Yuna. Let's got to Zanarkand. We'll find something
       there. It'll all come together! I know it!

Rikku: "Hey... Just now you sounded like a leader, you know?"

Tidus: "Star of the Zanarkand Abes! Didn't anyone tell you?"

[Tidus starts to walk off, but Rikku cries out. Behind them is Seymour.]

Seymour: "Ah, the son of Jecht."

Tidus: "Rikku, run ahead and tell Auron!"

Rikku: "You are not fighting him alone!"

Tidus: "Just go! Go!"

[She runs to get Auron.]

Seymour: "Now is your time to die. Prepare yourself, son of Jecht."

Tidus: "Not if I can help it!"

Kimahri: "Save some for Kimahri!"

[The party stands runs to Tidus.]

Seymour: "Lady Yuna, it is a pleasure."

Lulu: "Yuna!"

[Yuna starts to do the sending motions.]

Seymour: "A sending, so soon? Allow me to say something to the last Ronso
         before I leave. Yours was...truly a gallant race. They threw
         themselves at me to bar my path. One...after another..."

Kimahri: "No..."

Yuna: "Kimahri..."

Seymour: "You could end the suffering of this poor Ronso."

Yuna: "I don't understand you!"

Seymour: "Allow Kimahri to die, and release him from his pain. Spira...is a
         land of suffering and sorrow caught in a spiral of death. To destroy
         -- to heal -- Spira, I will become Sin. Yes, with your help. Come with
         me, Yuna."

[Tidus steps in front of Yuna.]

Seymour: "Once I have become the next Sin, your father will be freed again."

Tidus: "What do you know?

Seymour: "Pitiful mortal. Your hope ends here. And you meaningless existence
         with it."

[The party fights the creature Seymour becomes, sending it bursting into a
cloud of pyreflies.]

Tidus: "And stay up there!"

[The party starts to walk away.]

Yuna: "He will become Sin...with my help."

Auron: "Lies. Forget them."

Yuna: "If he becomes Sin, Sir Jecht will be saved."

Auron: "We're leaving."

Yuna: "You know something! Tell me! Tell me!"

[She runs to Tidus.]

Tidus: "Sin's...my old man."

Wakka: "You hit your head?"

Tidus: "Sin is my old man. My old man became Sin! I don't know how or why he
       did it. I felt him, inside. And when I did, I knew it was true. My old
       man is Spira's suffering. Sorry."

Yuna: "Even...knowing that Sin is your father... Still, you know, I must..."

Tidus: "I know. Let's get him. I think my old man would want that."

Lulu: "You'd fight your own father?"

Tidus: "Yeah. No problem there."

Wakka: "Uh... 'Bout your old man... You sure this ain't some kinda bad toxin
       dream or something? Then, Chappu... I, uh... I think I'll just pretend
       I didn't hear nothing. I'm getting a little confused, ya? Why... Why'd
       all this have to happen?"

Auron: "We'll learn when we arrive. Soon."

[The party walks into the next screen.]

Yuna: "Wow!"

[FMV. A large fayth dripping with energy is shown. It's massive.]

Wakka: "Wh-What are those?"

Yuna: "Those are fayth. A summoning! Someone is using these fayth! Someone
      is drawing energy from all of them!"

Rikku: "This many?"

Lulu: "Who wields power on this scale, and what could they be calling?"

[Rikku runs to Auron.]

Rikku: "Hey, you know something, don't you? Spill the beans!"

Aurons: "Look not to others for knowledge. This is your journey, too."

Rikku: "Yunie might die, you know?"

Tidus: "No... Auron's right. This is our... This is my story."

[Tidus touches the fayth and has a flashback to being in Zanarkand.]

Tidus: "Eh?"

[He walks into his houseboat and sees the 'Strange Boy' from Zanarkand, glowing
with the help of pyreflies.]

Fayth: "Welcome home."

Tidus: "You..."

Fayth: "Remember me? We met in Bevelle."

Tidus: "Yeah."

Fayth: "But that wasn't the first time we met. I've known about you for a long
       time. A long, long time."

Tidus: "I...I feel like I know you, too. Where are we?"

Fayth: "Silly, don't recognize your own home?"

[Wakka's figure appears in the living room...Then, Rikku's.]

Wakka: "What's gotten into you? Hey!"

Rikku: "Wake up! Wake up!

Tidus: "Wait...this is a dream."

Fayth: "Precisely."

Tidus: "A dream? Are you crazy? I don't have time to be dreaming now!"

Fayth: "You're wrong. It's not that you're dreaming. You are a dream."

Tidus: "Huh? Wait a sec."

[Tidus chases the fayth to the upperdeck.]

Fayth: "Long ago, there was a war."

Tidus: "Yeah, with machina, right?"

Fayth: "Yes. A war between Zanarkand and Bevelle. Bevelle's machina assured
       their victory from the start. Spira had never seen such power. The
       summoners of Zanarkand didn't stand a chance. Zanarkand was doomed to
       oblivion. That's why we tried to save it -- if only in a memory."

Tidus: "What did you do?"

Fayth: "The remaining summoners and the townspeople that survived the war...
       They all became fayth -- fayth for the summoning."

Tidus: "The summoning... You mean Sin?"

Fayth: "No. I mean this place. A Zanarkand that never sleeps."

Tidus: "What?"

Fayth: "The dreams of the fayth summoned the memories of the city. They
       summoned all the buildings, all the people who lived there."

Tidus: "The people... What, they're all dreams? Me, too?"

Fayth: "Yes, you're a dream of the fayth. You, your father, your mother,
       everyone. All dreams. And if the fayth stop dreaming..."

[The fayth shows him a Zanarkand without any buildings -- only his houseboat.]

Tidus: "No! So what if I'm a dream! I...I like being here."

Fayth: "We've been dreaming so long...we're tired. Would you and your father...
       Would you let us rest? Both you and your father have been touched by
       Sin. Sin, the one whom all Spira -- the spiral -- revolves."

Tidus: "What are you saying?"

Fayth: "You two are more than just dreams now."

[Yuna's figure appears in the dream.]

Yuna: "Wake up! Wake up, please!"

Fayth: "Just a little more, and maybe... Maybe you are the dream that will end
       our dreaming at last."

[The dream finishes and Tidus wakes up on his back, the party over him.]

Yuna: "Are you all right?"

Rikku: "Hey! We were so worried about you!"

Lulu: "You okay?"

Tidus: "I...I'm okay."

Yuna: "What happened?"

Tidus: "Nothing... I blacked out. I was dreaming. You called me...and I woke
       up. Nothing like a good nap! Well, I'm ready. Let's go."

[The party enters the caves and comes to a submerged portion.]

Wakka: "Looks like we got a job to do, ya?"

Lulu: "If anything should happen in the water, we're relying on you three. If
      it gets dangerous, pull out quick."

Wakka: "Right!"

Yuna: "Be careful, okay?"

[In the passage beyond, the party comes to a spinning device.]

Narrative: [The First Trial of Gagazet]

           Aim for the center with Wakka's ball!

[In the second passage, three colored panels are shown.]

Narrative: [The Second Trial of Gagazet]

           Hit the three panels simultaneously. Check each size before deciding
           who to send.

[The party finishes the trial and starts to head out.]

Auron: "They'll be upon us soon. She has sent fiends to test our summoner's
       strength."

Yuna: "Who is 'she'?"

Auron: "Yunalesca."

Yuna: "Lady Yunalesca?"

Auron: "In Zanarkand, she awaits the arrival of the strongest."

Yuna: "She...is still alive?"

Auron: "As much as Mika and Seymour."

Yuna: "I see."

Auron: "Lost your nerve?"

Yuna: "No. Nothing frightens me now."

Auron: "Braska would be proud."

Yuna: "Then...I must not let him down."

[The party walks out of the caves into the fresh air.]

Auron: "It comes!"

[The Sanctuary Keeper attacks, but is doesn't last long.]

Rikku: "Hey! Can't we rest a little?"

Auron: "No need. We reach the summit soon."

Rikku: "I know, that's why I want to stop for a bit. Soon means that... there's
       not much time left."

Yuna: "Rikku..."

Rikku: "Fine. I'll think on the way."

[The party starts walking. Walka goes over to Tidus.]

Wakka: "Hey, come on, let's go."

Tidus: "We are almost there, aren't we?"

Wakka: "We've come a long way."

[Auron chuckles.]

Tidus: "What's so funny?"

Auron: "You remind me of myself. Before, the closer I came to Zanarkand, the
       more I wondered...when we arrive, Braska will call the Final Aeon... He
       will fight Sin, then die. I thought my mind was made up long before. But
       when I stood here, my resolve wavered."

Wakka: "Huh, never would've figured. Legendary guardians choke sometimes, too,
       ya?"

Auron: "Legendary guardian? I was just a boy. A boy about your age, actually. I
       wanted to change the world, too. But I changed nothing. That is my
       story."

[Over the side of the summit, the party can see their first glances of the
dead Zanarkand, nearly pristine in its decayed state.]

T-Narrative: A city dead for a thousand years. A city I had to see with my own
             eyes. The end of Yuna's journey. The last chapter in my story. My
             thoughts, they kept floating up, and then slipping through my
             fingers. Slipping away before I could pin them down with words.

Rikku: "Yuna, I say no! If we go down there, then you'll...

Yuna: "Rikku. You're a true friend, and I thank you, but... I must go...down, to
      Zanarkand."

Rikku: "I'm not saying we shouldn't go. But shouldn't we think about it some
       more? There's gotta be some kind of way we can save you, Yuna!"

Yuna: "All my life, I knew this moment would come..."

Rikku: "Yunie..."

[Yuna hugs Rikku and, in the process, drops a sphere. Only Tidus notices.]

Yuna: "Thank you, Rikku. Thank you for everything."

Rikku: "Don't say that, Yunie! It's not over yet!"

Yuna: "Tell Cid thank you."

Rikku: "No... You can tell him yourself."

Yuna: "Please....:

Rikku: "Yunie, don't say that because...we're gonna see each other again,
       okay?"

Yuna: "Kimahri, let's go."

[The party moves on but Tidus looks at Yuna's sphere. Yuna's in it, recording
at the Mi'ihen Highroad travel agency, on the hill.]

Yuna: "Sir Auron. Kimahri told me...when my father wanted me taken from Bevelle
      to Besaid... It was you who told Kimahri, right? I had always wanted to
      meet you someday. I am truly glad that I had that chance. Having you as a
      guardian was so great an honor that I don't know how to thank you.
      Perhaps if I defeat Sin, that will be my thanks to you. That's what I'll
      do. Yes. I will challenge Sin. I will defeat Sin. If you are all there
      watching this, then I guess Sin is already gone. And so am I, I suppose.
      Anyway, I just wanted to say: Sir Auron, I thank you.

      Kimahri... Do you remember the first day we met? I was only seven. My
      father had defeated Sin, and all Bevelle was celebrating. Everyone was
      saying what a hero my father was. I was so happy. But when night came, it
      occurred to me. My father had defeated Sin and now he was dead. Now, I
      was all alone. I couldn't sleep, so I wandered into the town, away from
      the celebrating crowds. I stood on the bridge to Bevelle where my father
      and I had parted. Standing there, alone, I could see the fiends where he
      had fought Sin. Then, you appeared, Kimahri. You said you were looking
      for the daughter of Braska, remember? At first, I was so scared. Until I
      realized what a gentle person you are. You weren't used to talking to
      children. When I told you that I was Braska's daughter...you said you
      would take me as far from Bevelle as you could. That it was the wish of a
      man facing death. I think...I cried then. Because that...that was when I
      knew my father was dead...and I would never see him again. You just held
      me, without saying a word. I cried after we got to Besaid, too. When you
      tried to go after leaving me in the care of the temple...I held onto you,
      crying, 'Don't go, don't go!' And you listened, Kimahri. You stayed.
      Kimahri, thank you. Thank you so much. And I've always liked your broken
      horn.

      Wakka, Lulu: I'll never forget my days spent with you, growing up in
      Besaid. We always played together, us and Chappu. That's why I was always
      so happy, I think. And when you refused to let me become a summoner and I
      did it anyway... I'm sorry. I've always wanted to apologize. You know,
      when you tried to stop me then -- really, I was happy. I could tell you
      really cared about me. You were like my big brother and sister. No... I
      think you really were my big brother and sister. What else... I love
      watching you play blitzball, Wakka. I even love it when you scold me,
      Lulu! Really!

      I guess that leaves...the newest guardian. Star player of the Zanarkand
      Abes! You are... I am... Well, um... I'm glad...I'm glad that we met. We
      haven't even known each other that long, but... It's funny. So this is
      what it feels like. It's a much more wonderful feeling than anything I
      had ever imagined. Wonderful...but it hurts, sometimes. I wonder. I...I
      just want to say, thank you for everything. Maybe...maybe that's why it
      hurts. When I... When I think about us never being together again at
      all... I'm afraid. No, I shouldn't say that. I'll do that part over.
      Um..."

Tidus: "Whatcha up to?"

[The sphere shuts off and Tidus catches up with the party at the bottom of the
mountain's side. They're all watching the sunset and the colored clouds. They
build a campfire and sit around it as in the game's opening sequence. Tidus
climbs a hill and surveys the sunset.]

T-Narrative: Listen to my story. This may be our last chance.

[The party sits at the campfire later, reminiscing.]

Tidus: "Hey! There was more, right? I mean like that time...uh... Anyone?"

Yuna: "I think..."

Tidus: "Yes?"

Yuna: "I think that we should stop...maybe. For now. Let's go."

[The party walks along a crumbled road, pyreflies dotting the watery ditches.]

Wakka: "Looks like the Farplane."

Auron: "Close enough."

[The party comes to a large stadium's entrance and a man walks out.]

Man: "Journeyer of the long road, name yourself."

Yuna: "I am the summoner Yuna. I have come from the island of Besaid."

Man: "Your eyes, my dear. Show me the long road you have travelled. Very good.
     You have journeyed well. Lady Yunalesca will surely welcome your arrival.
     Go to her now, and bring your guardians with you. Go."

[The man walks by and fades away. Inside the old blitzball stadium, a specter
of a previous summoner and her guardians appears.]

Guardian: "If it might benefit the future of Spira, I will gladly give my life.
          It is the highest honor for which a guardian might ask. Use my life,
          Lady Yocun, and rid Spira of Sin."

[The specters disappear.]

Rikku: "What...what was that?"

Auron: "Our predecessors."

Lulu: "She said 'Lady Yocun,' didn't she? Wait! She guarded High Summoner
      Yocun?"

Auron: "This dome is filled with pyreflies. It's like one gigantic sphere.
       People's thoughts remain here. Forever."

[Later on, a boy's specter appears out of pyreflies.]

Boy: "No! Mother, no! I don't want you to become a fayth!"

Woman: "There is no other way. Use me and defeat Sin. Only then will the people
       accept you."

Boy: "I don't care about them! I need you, Mother! No one else!"

Woman: "I don't...have much time left."

[The specters disappear.]

Wakka: "Hey, wasn't that...?

Rikku: "Seymour?"

[The party goes only a shortways before the specters of Braska, Jecht, and
Auron appear, running alongside the party in a different time.]

Tidus: "Ah!"

Jecht: "Hey, Braska. You don't have to do this."

Braska: "Thank you for your concern."

Jecht: "Fine. I said my piece."

Auron: "Well, I haven't! Lord Braska, let us go back! I don't want to see
       you...die!"

Braska: "You knew this was to happen, my friend."

Auron: "Yes, but I...I cannot accept it."

Braska: "Auron, I am honored that you care for me so. But I have come to kill
        grief itself. I will defeat Sin, and lift the veil of sorrow covering
        Spira. Please understand, Auron."

[The specters head into the next screen, and the party follows them.]

Jecht: "Are the Trials ahead?"

Braska: "Probably."

Jecht: "Here, too, huh? Gimme a break. I was expecting, you know, parades
       and...fireworks!"

Braska: "You can ask for them after I defeat Sin."

[The party makes it through the trials and defeats the Spectral Keeper. An
elevator comes up.]

Auron: "Yuna... We're here."

Yuna: "The hall of the Final Summoning."

Auron: "Go."

Yuna: "Yes."

[She gets on the elevator by herself and descends. Jecht says, on some plane:]

Jecht: "Huh? What do you mean no Final Aeon?"

[She comes back up.]

Yuna: "Sir Auron! Everyone!"

[They all get on and descend, walking into the fayth's room.]

Yuna: "This isn't a fayth. It's just an empty statue."

[The man from the dome entrance appears.]

Man: "That statue lost its power as a fayth long ago. It is Lord Zaon, the
     first fayth of the Final Summoning. What you see before you is all that
     remains of him. Lord Zaon is...his soul is gone."

Wakka: "Gone!?"

Rikku: "You mean, there is no Final Aeon?"

Man: "But fear not. Lady Yunalesca will show you the path. The Final Aeon will
     be yours. The summoner and the Final Aeon will join powers. Go to her
     now. Inside, the lady awaits."

[The man disappears, and a door opens up behind Yuna.]

Tidus: "Yuna, wait! Auron, you knew this was going to happen, didn't you?"

Auron: "Yes."

Rikku: "Why didn't you tell us!?"

Auron: "If I had told you the truth, would that really have stopped you from
       coming?"

Kimahri: "Yuna."

Yuna: "I'm not going back."

Kimahri: "Kimahri knows. Kimahri go first. Yuna is safe. Kimahri protect."

[The party walks through door into a well-lit room. The door at the top of
the stair starts to open.]

Rikku: "Someone's coming!"

Yuna: "Lady Yunalesca."

Yunalesca: "Welcome to Zanarkand. I congratulate you, summoner. You have
           completed your pilgrimage. I will now bestow upon you that which
           you seek. The Final Summoning...will be yours. Now, choose. You must
           choose the one whom I will change...to become the fayth for the
           Final Summoning. There must be a bond, between chosen and summoner,
           for that is what the Final Aeon embodies: the bond between husband
           and wife, mother and child, or between friends. If that bond is
           strong enough, its light will conquer Sin. A thousand years ago, I
           chose my husband Zaon as my fayth. Our bond was true, and I obtained
           the Final Aeon. There is nothing to fear. You will soon be freed of
           worry and pain. For once you call forth the Final Aeon, your life
           will end. Death is the ultimate and final liberation. Your father,
           Braska, chose this path."

[The pyreflies recall the moment that Braska and his guardians had to decide.]

Auron: "It is not too late! Let us turn back!"

Braska: "If I turn back, who will defeat Sin? Would you have some other
        summoner and his guardians go through this?"

Auron: "But...my lord, there must be another way!"

Jecht: "This is the only way we got now! Fine. Make me the fayth. I been doing
       some thinking. My dream is back in the other Zanarkand. I wanted to make
       that runt into a star blitz player. Show him the view from the top, you
       know. But now I know there's no way home for me. I'm never gonna see him
       again. My dream's never gonna come true. So make me the fayth. I'll
       fight Sin with you, Braska. Then maybe my life will have meaning, you
       know."

Auron: "Don't do this, Jecht! If you live...there may be another way! We'll
       think of something, I know!"

Jecht: "Believe me, I thought this through. Besides... I ain't gettin' any
       younger, so I might as well make myself useful."

Braska: "Jecht."

Jecht: "What! You're not gonna try to stop me, too?"

Braska: "Sorry. I mean...thank you."

Jecht: "Braska still has to fight Sin, Auron. Guard him well. Make sure he
       gets there. Well, let's go."

Auron: "Lord Braska! Jecht!"

Jecht: "What do you want now?"

Auron: "Sin always comes back. It comes back after the Calm every time! The
       cycle will continue and your deaths will mean nothing!"

Braska: "But there's always a chance it won't come back this time. It's worth
        trying."

Jecht: "I understand what you're saying, Auron. I'll find a way to break the
       cycle."

Auron: "You have a plan?"

Braska: "Jecht?"

Jecht: "Trust me, I'll think of something."

[Jecht and Braska leave through the door at the top of the stair. Auron cuts
through the specter of his former self and dispels it.]

Auron: "And the cycle went on."

Tidus: "We'll break it!"

Wakka: "But how? What, you got a plan now?"

Lulu: "If one of us has to become a fayth...I volunteer."

Wakka: "Me too, Yuna!

Tidus: "Tidus: That still won't change anything, you know? You'd bring the
       Calm, and then what? That won't break the cycle!"

Wakka: "Listen... You wanna defeat Sin and keep Yuna alive... You don't want
       Sin to come back, ya? That is just not gonna happen, brudda, you know?"

Lulu: "If you want everything, you'll end up with nothing."

Tidus: "But I want everything!"

Wakka: "Now you're being childish!"

Tidus; "I give up! So what would an adult do, then? They know they can just
       throw away a summoner, then they can do whatever they like. You're
       right. I might not even have a chance. But no way am I gonna just stand
       here and let Yuna go. And what Auron said about there being a way... I
       think it's true."

Rikku: "'You'll think of something'?"

Tidus: "I'll go ask Yunalesca. She's got to know something."

Rikku: "You really think she'll help you?"

Tidus: "I don't know, but I have to try. This is my story. It'll go the way I
       want it...or I'll end it here."

Yuna: "Wait. You say it's your story, but it's my story, too, you know? It
      would be so easy...to let my fate just carry me away...following this
      same path my whole life through. But I know...I can't. What I do, I
      do...with no regrets."

[The party walks into Yunalesca's chambers.]

Yunalesca: "Have you chosen the one to become your fayth? Who will it be?"

Yuna: "Might I ask something first? Will Sin come back even should I use the
      Final Summoning to defeat it?"

Yunalesca: "Sin is eternal. Every aeon that defeats it becomes Sin in its
           place... And thus is Sin reborn."

Tidus: "So that's why Jecht became Sin."

Yunalesca: "Sin is an inevitable part of Spira's destiny. It is neverending."

Wakka: "Neverending? But...but...if we atone for our crimes, Sin will stop
       coming back, ya? Someday, it'll be gone, ya?"

Yunalesca: "Will humanity ever attain such purity?"

Lulu: "This...this cannot be! The teachings state that we can exorcise Sin
      with complete atonement! It's been our only hope all these years!"

Yunalesca: "Hope is...comforting. It allows us to accept fate, however tragic
           it might be."

Tidus: "No!"

[Just then, the specter of Auron from ten years prior appears, squaring off
against Yunalesca, saying:]

Auron: "No! Where is the sense in all this? Braska believed in Yevon's
       teachings and died for them! Jecht believed in Braska and gave his life
       for him!"

Yunalesca: "They chose to die...because they had hope."

[The image of Auron brandishes his sword against Yunalesca and attacks, but
she repels him. The specter flies back, falls on his neck, and doesn't move;
it disappears into pyreflies.]

Yunalesca: "Yevon's teachings and the Final Summoning give the people of Spira
           hope. Without hope, they would drown in their sorrow. Now, choose.
           Who will be your fayth? Who will be the one to renew Spira's hope?"

Yuna: "No one. I would have gladly died. I live for the people of Spira, and
      would have gladly died for them. But no more! The Final Summoning...is a
      false tradition that should be thrown away."

Yunalesca: "No. It's our only hope. Your father sacrificed himself to give that
           hope to the people. So they would forget sorrow."

Yuna: "Wrong. My father... My father wanted...to make Spira's sorrow go away.
      Not just cover it up with lies!"

Yunalesca: "Sorrow cannot be abolished. It is meaningless to try."

Yuna: "My father... I loved him. So I...  I will live with my sorrow, I will
      live my own life! I will defeat sorrow, in his place. I will stand my
      ground and be strong. I don't know when it will be but someday, I will
      conquer it. And I will do it without...false hope."

Yunalesca: "Poor creature. You would throw away hope. Well... I will free you
           before you can drown in your sorrow. It is better for you to die in
           hope than to live in despair. Let me be your liberator."

[Yunalesca prepares for battle.]

Auron: "Now! This is it! Now is the time to choose! Die and be free of pain or
       live and fight your sorrow! Now is the time to shape your stories! Your
       fate is in your hands!"

Kimahri: "Yuna needs Kimahri. Kimahri protect Yuna."

Rikku: "Well, I'm fighting!"

Wakka: "I can't believe we're gonna fight Lady Yunalesca! Gimme a break!"

Lulu: "You can always run."

Wakka: "Hah! I'd never forgive myself -- no way! Not if I ran away now. Even
       in death, ya!"

Lulu: "My thoughts exactly."

Tidus: "Yuna! This is our story! Now let's see this thing through together."

[The party fights and defeats Yunalesca, in all three forms.]

Yunalesca: "If I die, so does the Final Aeon. And with it, Spira's only hope."

Tidus: "Then we'll find Spira a new hope!"

Yunalesca: "Fool. There is no other way. Even if there was... Even if you did
           destroy Sin... Yu Yevon the immortal would only create Sin anew."

Tidus: "Yu Yevon!?"

Yunalesca: "Ah... Zaon... Forgive me... Spira has been robbed of the light of
           hope... All that remains is sorrow."

[Yunalesca dies and turns to pyreflies.]

Yuna: "I cannot believe what we just did."

Tidus: "Let's do something more unbelievable."

Rikku: "What?"

Tidus: "Destroy Sin. So it won't come back, and without the Final Aeon. I
       don't know how just yet. But I'll find out."

[The party starts to walk back to the elevator. Auron calls Tidus aside.]

Auron: "We must talk."

Tidus: "What?"

Auron: "There is something you should know."

Tidus: "I know...it's about you, right?"

Auron: "I am also an unsent. You are not surprised?"

Tidus: "I think I kinda knew. It was Yunalesca, wasn't it?"

Auron: "When Braska and Jecht died defeating Sin...I just couldn't accept it.
       I came back here...tried to avenge them. But she struck me down. Somehow
       I made my way, crawling, down Mount Gagazet. But my strength left me
       just outside Bevelle. That's where Kimahri found me. I told him about
       Yuna...just before I died. I've been wandering ever since, never going
       to the Farplane."

Tidus: "Auron..."

Auron: "Don't make that face. Being dead has its advantages. I was able to ride
       Sin and go to your Zanarkand."

Tidus: "And you've been watching over me since then, haven't you? Why? What's
       the big idea? Why me?"

Auron: "It is one of those things that is difficult to explain. Very well, I
       will show you. My memories."

[Pyreflies come out of Auron and display one of his memories to Tidus. Jecht
and Braska are there, in Zanarkand.]

Jecht: "Can I ask you one last favor? Uh... Nah. Never mind."

Auron: "Out with it!"

Jecht: "Okay. Listen good. Take care of my son. My son, in Zanarkand. He's such
       a crybaby. He needs someone there to hold his hand, see? Take care of
       him, will you?"

Auron: "But how am I supposed to go to Zanarkand?"

Jecht: "Hey! You said it yourself! There must be a way to get there, right?
       You'll find it."

Auron: "All right, I will! I give you my word. I'll take care of your son.
       I'll guard him with my life."

Jecht: "Thanks, Auron. You were always such a stiff, but that's what I liked
       about you.

[Auron's pyrefly memory concludes.]

Auron: "That is why."

[The party walks out of the old stadium dome and Sin is there, watching them
silently.]

Tidus: (Dad? I know. The Final Summoning's gone. But I'll think of something!
       Just give me a little more time!)

[FMV. Sin slides back into the water and leaves, while the Al Bhed Airship
flies down to pick up the party.]

[The party gets on the airship.]

Brother: "Frana du huf?" ["Where to now?"]

Cid: "Aren't we the happy lookin' bunch?"

Brother: "Frana? Frana?" ["Where? Where?"]

Rikku: "'Where, where?' That all you can say? Why don't you think of
       something!?""

Auron: "Well? Any good ideas?"

Tidus: "Come on, help us?"

Auron: "What do we know... Sin is Jecht. Thus, you have a link...a bond with
       Sin. That may be our key."

Tidus: "So what do we do?"

Auron: "We think, and we wait."

Tidus: "Two things I'm bad at."

[Yuna and Kimahri go to the upperdeck viewing area later. Tidus drops by.]

Yuna: "I'm no good at all."

Tidus: "What are you talking about?"

Yuna: "All this time, I've been thinking about how to defeat Sin. But I...
      Beyond the teachings of Yevon, I...I know nothing. I'm sorry."

Kimahri: "Yuna, no apologies."

Yuna: "Huh?"

Kimahri: "Apology is running. Yuna never run away."

Yuna: "Thank you, Kimahri."

Tidus: "So, uh, Kimahri... You got any good ideas?"

Kimahri: "Yevon's teachings."

Yuna: "The teachings won't help us fight Sin."

Kimahri: "No answer in the teachings, answers lie outside. Must know both
         sides to find answer."

Yuna: "Both sides..."

Kimahri: "Mika knows much. Find him, make him talk."

Tidus: "That's it! Kimahri! You rock!

[Tidus runs back to the bridge.]

Wakka: "Hey, guys! I just had a great idea!"

Rikku: "It was my idea. Let me tell them!"

Wakka: "It's like this, ya?"

Rikku: "I just thought!"

Lulu: "The Hymn is the key."

Tidus: "The Hymn?"

Lulu: "Sir Jecht likes the Hymn of the Fayth, correct?"

Tidus: "Yeah."

Rikku: "That's why he was listening to it in Macalania!"

Lulu: "Sin...violence incarnate, listening peacefully."

Wakka: "I know it's your old man, and I don't mean no disrespect, but..."

Tidus: "No, it's fine. I've gotten used to it."

Lulu: "Let me say it. If we attack Sin head-on, we've little chance of
      winning. However, if he hears the Hymn of the Fayth, he will become
      docile."

Wakka: "Yeah, and that's when we make our move! Might be against the rules
       and all, but who's keeping track, ya? Ya?"

Rikku: "Yeah! It could really work!"

Tidus: "Yeah... Yeah, it's worth a try!"

Narrative: Talk to Cid to open the NavMap. Pick a destination, and you're
           there!

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

[The party arrives at the Highbridge and is 'greeted' by two warrior monks.]

Warrior Monk: "Infidel!"

Wakka: "Man, don't these guys ever give up?"

Warrior Monk: "You'll regret showing your face here! We'll strike you down in
              the name of Yevon!"

Tidus: "Blah, blah, blah. Yeah, so? Guys?"

Rikku: "If they want a fight, let's give 'em one!"

Warrior Monk: "Prepare to charge!"

Shelinda: "Stop!"

[Shelinda runs out of a door nearby.]

Warrior Monk: "Captain?"

Shelinda: "Lady Yuna is not to be harmed! She's no traitor! That is an evil
          rumor spread by the Al Bhed!"

Rikku: "What?"

Shelinda: "Maester Mika himself told me."

Warrior Monk: "Then...what are we to do?"

Rikku: "Stand down!"

Shelinda: "As she says!"

[The monks back off.]

Rikku: "What was that about evil Al Bhed?"

Shelinda: "I... Truly, I do not understand it myself. All Yevon seems to be in
          a state of confusion. Why, yesterday they called me out of the blue
          and made me captain of the guard!"

Auron: "Short on believers?"

Shelinda: "Yes, the chaos in the temples is worse than I'd imagined. It's
          horrible! And all the priests do is blame each other. I worry what
          will become of Yevon. But no! I must be the rock that stands against
          the swirling tides, right? Lady Yuna, I must tell you, your courage
          has been a great inspiration to me."

Tidus: "Yeah, that's great, but we came here to see Maester Mika. Is he here?"

Shelinda: "Yes, I shall arrange an audience. Please wait in the courtroom."

[She runs off.]

Rikku: "Hey, hey, wait! What was all that about the Al Bhed lying and stuff?"

Auron: "Simple. Yuna has become Mika's only hope."

Rikku: "Oh... Okay."

Lulu: "Just what does he think he can get away with?"

Tidus: "Time to teach him some manners!"

Yuna: "Yes, let's."

[The meeting takes place a little while later.]

Mika: "Why are you here? You must go and defeat Sin, quickly! You have
      obtained the Final Aeon from Yunalesca, have you not?"

Tidus: "Well, we did meet her."

Yuna: "We fought and defeated her."

Mika: "What!"

Auron: "Summoners and guardians will be sacrificed for the Final Summoning no
       more!"

Mika: "You have profaned and subverted a thousand-year-old tradition? Fools!
      Infants! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken away the only
      means of calming Sin!"

Tidus: "Hey, maybe that's not the only way! We think we've got another."

Mika: "Why... Preposterous! There is no other way!"

Auron: "The grand maester, running away?"

Mika: "Spira has lost its only hope. Destruction is inevitable. Yu Yevon's
      spiral of death will consume us all. I have no desire to watch Spira
      die."

Yuna: "It won't die!"

Tidus: "Who is this Yu Yevon guy?"

Lulu: "Lady Yunalesca also mentioned him."

Rikku: "Wait, gramps! Who's Yu Yevon?"

Mika: "He who crafts the souls of the dead into unholy armor. An armor called
      Sin. Clad in it, Yu Yevon is invincible. And the only thing that could
      have pierced that armor, you have destroyed! Nothing can stop it now."

[Mika raises his hands and fades away into pyreflies.]

Wakka: "Disappear on us, will ya? Rotton son of a shoopuf!"

[Shelinda runs in.]

Shelinda: "Where...where is the grand maester?"

Yuna: "He, um..."

Auron: "He's not here yet. How long must we wait?"

Shelinda: "That's odd... I'll go look for His Grace."

[Shelinda leaves and the fayth Tidus sees appears.]

Tidus: "It's you."

Fayth: "Come, to my room."

Yuna: "Okay."

[It disappears.]

Wakka: "Who you talking to?"

Tidus: "Oh. Uh, no one."

Yuna: "I must go see the fayth."

Auron: "I see."

[In the Chamber of the Fayth, the boy fayth reappears.]

Fayth: "Hello."

Yuna: "I must thank you for the aeon."

Tidus: "So, what's up?"

Fayth: "So, have you found a way to truly defeat Sin?"

Tidus: "Well..."
       R1 --> I think so.
       R2 --> Not yet.

       R1 (Fayth): "Well?"
                   R3 --> The Hymn of the Fayth!
                   R4 --> Defeat Yu Yevon!
                   R5 --> No idea...

       R2: "Well, come see me when you do. We'll talk then."
       R3: "We think the Hymn of the Fayth might slow Sin down."
           Fayth: "Hmm... Perhaps."
           Yuna: "You mean, it won't work?"
           Fayth: "A very long time has passed since your father became Sin.
                  He may not be able to hear the hymn anymore."
           Tidus: "I know it's a long shot... But we gotta try anyway if
                  there's a chance."
           Fayth: "Yes, you must. I'm glad you're doing this. You have a good
                  spirit, truly."
           Tidus: "I'm not just a dream, right?"
           Yuna: "A dream?"
           Tidus: "Uh... It's a long story."
           Fayth: "If it works, what'll you do then? You need more than the
                  hymn."
           Tidus: "Well..."
           Fayth: "Well?"
                  [Options R3/R4/R5 come up again.]
       R4: "We fight Yu Yevon."
           Fayth: "Yes... If you defeat Yu Yevon, it will end. Tell me, what
                  do you know about Yu Yevon?"
           Tidus: "He's what makes Sin come back!"
           Yuna: "Sin is his armor. It protects him."
           Fayth: "Yu Yevon was once a summoner, long ago. He was peerless.
                  Yet now he lives for one purpose: only to summon. He is
                  neither good, nor evil. He is awake, yet he dreams. But...
                  maybe not forever."
           Tidus: "Yeah, that's right. Because we're ending it."
           Fayth: "Yes. Even if you defeat Sin with the Final Summoning, Yu
                  Yevon will live. Yu Yevon will join with the Final Aeon. He
                  will transform it into a new Sin. Yu Yevon merges with the
                  aeon... Then, protected by this new Sin he has created, Yu
                  Yevon continues the summoning."
           Tidus: "For eternity...huh?"
           Fayth: "But you know, there is no such thing as eternity if you end
                  it, is there?"
           Tidus: "Uh-huh."
           Fayth: "Yu Yevon lives inside Sin. Yuna, listen. When you fight Yu
                  Yevon, we will help you. Promise me you'll summon us. I'm
                  afraid your swords and magic won't be enough. Please, call
                  us. Promise?"
           Yuna: "Yes."
           Fayth: "But, you know... When it is all over...we will wake, and
                  our dream will end. Our dream will vanish."
           Tidus: "Yeah. You've been dreaming a long time, haven't you?"
           Fayth: "I'm sorry."
           Tidus: "I'm grateful."
                  [The Fayth vanishes.]
           Yuna: "About what?"
           Tidus: "Oh, nothing. Hey, don't make that face! Come on! We're
                  gonna beat Sin! Let's see some cheer, okay?"
           Yuna: "You're hiding something."
           Tidus: "I'm not!"
           Yuna: "Really?"
           [Tidus walks away.]
           Yuna: "You're a bad liar, you know?"
       R5: "Well, come see me when you do. We'll talk then."

[The Chamber scene ends and the party's back at Highbridge. Shelinda runs out.]

Shelinda: "I'm afraid the grand maester is nowhere to be found!"

Tidus: "S'okay, we were just leaving."

Shelinda: "Oh...I see."

Rikku: "Hey! Maybe you could help us with the hymn."

Tidus: "Hey, good idea!"

Rikku: "It's like, we need you to tell as many people as you can."

Shelinda: "What should I tell them?"

Rikku: "A ship in the sky will sing the Hymn of the Fayth. When they hear it,
       we need everyone to sing along!"

Wakka: "Everyone in Spira!"

Shelinda: "I'm not sure I understand."

Rikku: "You don't have to! Just tell everyone!"

Shelinda: "A ship in the sky will sing the Hymn of the Fayth? So when they hear
          it, everyone should sing along, correct?"

Tidus: "If they do, we might be able to defeat Sin!"

Shelinda: "Truly?"

Yuna: "Yes!"

Shelinda: "That's wonderful! You can count on me! I shall tell all of Spira!"

[Back on the airship, the party prepares to attack Sin.]

Cid: "Well, this is it, eh?"

Tidus: "Yu Yevon's hiding somewhere inside Sin, and we're gonna find him."

Cid: "Well, that sounds pretty simple."

Tidus: "Simple is the way you like it, right?"

Cid: "You got that right."

Rikku: "Pops! I'm countin' on you!"

Cid: "Right, got you covered!"

[Cid fiddles with a panel.]

Cid: "How's that?"

Rikku: "Right on!"

Lulu: "A singing ship in the sky."

Wakka: "I hope everyone got the message."

Brother: "Sin!"

[FMV. The ship looks at Sin.]

Tidus: "All right, we're going in!"

Wakka: "How we gonna get inside?"

Tidus: "The easy way! How else?"

Rikku: "Figures."

Lulu: "Well? Let's go!"

Cid: "Hey, how you plan on getting inside?"

Tidus: "If we can't get in through the mouth, we'll rip open a new one! You
       with me?"

Cid: "Now that's what I call a plan!"

Brother: "Vydran! E ghuf fryd du ica!" ["Father! I know what to use!"]

Cid: "Aha! Of course!"

Tidus: "Of course!"

Cid: "All right! We'll give that thing a new blowhole. All you gotta do is
     jump!"

Tidus: "Roger!"

Cid: "I won't tell ya to be careful. Do your worst, kiddo!"

Tidus: "Roger!"

Brother: "Fyed! Rikku, you...guard." ["Wait! Rikku, you...guard."]

Tidus: "Will do!"

[The party runs up on the deck.]

Rikku: "I can hear the song!"

Lulu: "Yes, I can hear the Hymn, too."

Rikku: "They listened to us!"

Tidus: "We won't let them down! Yuna? You don't need this anymore, right?"

[He shows her the sphere she dropped on Mt. Gagazet, much to her surprise.]

Tidus: "Right?"

[He chucks it overboard. The ship goes tremulant for a moment.]

Wakka: "Hey, guys? Guys? That's not good, ya?"

[FMV. Sin forms a giant ball of energy out at sea, encasing it. FMV. It shoots
energy balls in eight directions. They cut a path through the earth and sea,
and a large backlash of debris and dirt kicks up towards the ship. FMV. The
eight paths carved by Sin are set ablaze and can be seen from outer space. As
Tidus looks up after diving for cover, he looks right into Sin's multi-eyed
face.]

Tidus: "Damn you, old man..."

[The loudspeaker clicks on.]

Cid: "Hey, I saw somethin' shine on the base of Sin's arm! I reckon its a
     weak spot!"

[The ship shakes again.]

Brother: "Cruud!" ["Shoot!"]

Cid: "Fryd, fryd?" ["What, what?"]

Brother: "Fa yna bimmat po Sin!" ["We are pulled by Sin!"]

Rikku: "Sin's pulling us in!"

[Sin flies alongside the ship, keeping time.]

Cid: "Everyone, back aside!"

Brother: "Duu myda! Ed lusac!" ["Too late! It comes!"]

[The party fights Sin's left fin and destroys the 'shiny spot' it connects at.]

Cid: "Here goes! Everyone, hold on to something! Here we go!"

[FMV. The Al Bhed ship uses forbidden machina to blow the left fin clean off.]

Tidus: "Got it!"

Cid: "Couldn't have done it without you! All right! Everyone look sharp! Time
     to hit the other side!"

Rikku: "Easy for you to say!"

[The team defeats the junction on the right fin, too.]

Cid: "Nayto? Vena!" ["Ready? Fire!"]

[FMV. The machina guns shed the right fin off, too.]

Cid: "Yeehaw! Where next?"

Brother: "Ed ec ujan." ["It is over."]

Cid: "Fryd? Fa ryja uhmo pakih!" ["What? We have only begun!"]

Brother: "Pid dra syeh kih, ed ec pnugah!" ["But the main gun, it is broken!"]

Cid: "Dr-Dryd lyhhud pa!" ["Th-That cannot be!"]

[Out on the deck:]

Rikku: "The main gun's busted!"

Cid: "Dang it! All right, back inside! Time for another plan!"

Tidus: "No! We're going in! Every blitzer knows: when you got the ball, you
       gotta score!"

[1] Yuna: "Let's go!"
[2] Wakka: "Go, go, go!"
[3] Rikku: "See you there!"
[4] Kimahri: "On my honor as Ronso!"
[5] Lulu: "A day with you is never dull!"
[6] Auron: "Foolhardy... But a fun plan."

[Lulu jumps off the ship towards Sin.]

Tidus: "Hey! Star players first!"

[The party jumps onto Sin and engages Sin's core, defeating it. FMV. Sin
freefalls down to Bevelle and crashes to a stop right by the city. The party
watches the smoke and dust clouds from the wreck.]

Brother: "Vydran! E lyhhud pameaja fryd E caa!" ["Father! I cannot believe
         what I see!"]

Cid: "Pameaja ed, cuh! Drao'ja tuha ed! Ed ec rybbahehk!" ["Believe it,
     son! They've done it! It is happening!"]

[The party runs back to the bridge.]

Brother: "Rikku, aqlammahd!" ["Rikku, excellent!"]

Yuna: "It's going to come back, isn't it?"

Tidus: "I know."

Cid: "What? You're kidding me!"

Tidus: "No! We have to beat the guy inside Sin."

Wakka: "The Crusaders would be out of a job if it was this easy."

Lulu: "But it has weakened. I'm sure of it."

Rikku: "Yeah! We're winning!"

Cid: "All right, I'll do what I can with the main gun!"

[Cid walks out, and so does Yuna. Tidus finds the latter on the top deck.]

Yuna: "I wonder if Sir Jecht is in pain."

Tidus: "Let's just end this...quickly. The fayth said they would help us,
       right?"

Yuna: "It bothers me, the way they said that."

Tidus: "Huh?"

Yuna: "I mean, they've been fighting alongside us this whole time, but now
      they say they'll help?"

Tidus: "I guess so..."

Yuna: "Wait! Sin is reborn when Yu Yevon merges with an aeon, isn't that right?
      If I summon an aeon, Yu Yevon will join with it. But at first, it'll be
      small, won't it?"

Tidus: "Yeah... Then, we might be able to defeat Sin without the Final
       Summoning."

Yuna: "I don't know. What if Yu Yevon jumps again?"

Tidus: "Then we'll take it down again! We'll fight him until there's no place
       left to run!"

Yuna: "I never thought it would come down to this."

Tidus: "Yeah, I know. Hey, the fayth, they're tired of this whole thing, too.
       Let's let them rest."

Yuna: "The fayth said it's pointless to keep dreaming. The dream will
      disappear, he said. What did he mean? And what is it that Yu Yevon is
      summoning from within Sin?"

Tidus: "The dream of the fayth."

Yuna: "You won't...go away, will you?"

[Rikku yells over the loudspeaker.]

Rikku: "Yunie! Guys! Come look! Something's happening to Sin!"

[FMV. Sin rises up from near Bevelle, grows wings, and perches atop the Tower
of Light delicately. Tidus and Yuna return to the bridge.]

Auron: "Jecht... He's waiting for you."

Cid: "Well, son, the main gun is still busted! We can't give you any cover
     fire!"

Tidus: "Hey, just take us in. We'll do the rest."

Cid: "All right. Take us up, flush to the mouth! No mistakes, or I'm gonna
     tear out that mop you call hair!"

Brother: "Trust...me. Me...take you there. No problem...ya?"

Tidus: "Let's get ready to blitz!"

[1] Lulu: "Let's go. Just you and me."
[2] Auron: "My story must end as well."
[3] Kimahri: "You are Kimahri's friend."
[4] Rikku: "Don't worry. I'll cover you!"
[5] Wakka: "Time to show them what we're made of, ya?"
[6] Yuna: "Our fathers' wishes... Let's make them come true!"

[The party runs onto the deck and sees Sin. FMV. Sin flies up to the airship's
level and spots it.]

Cid: "Here we go!"

Tidus: "Yeah! I'm coming for you, Dad!"

[The party defeats Sin. FMV. Sin opens its mouth and uses its gravity to pull
the ship in. As the ship enters inside of Sin, Seymour's face flashes before
everyone. The ship lands safely, though.]

Tidus: "Dad! Where are you?"

Auron: "We must go to him."

Tidus: "Then we will! Let me take front!"

Yuna: "Good luck."

Tidus: "Follow me!"

[The party runs along the misty path until the party happens upon Seymour.]

Tidus: "Don't you ever give up?"

Seymour: "Sin has chosen me. I am part of Sin. I am one with Sin, forever.
         Immortal!"

Tidus: "Sin just absorbed you."

Seymour: "I will learn to control it, from within. I have all the time in the
         world. Since you were gracious enough to dispose of Yunalesca...the
         only means of destroying Sin is forever gone. Now nothing can stop
         us!"

Tidus: "Well, we can!"

Seymour: "By all means, try! You should thank me! Your death means your
         father's life!"

[Seymour gets beaten like a ornery shoopuf.]

Seymour: "No!"

Wakka: "Now! Yuna, send him!"

Yuna: "Right!

[Yuna starts to send him.]

Seymour: "So it is you, after all, who will send me. But even after I am gone,
         Spira's sorrow will prevail."

[Seymour turns to pyreflies.]

Tidus: "Sin will be right behind you."

[After the Tower of the Dead, Tidus is teleported to 'The Nucleus,' where he
finds spheres and equipment spawning. After collecting ten, he ends up in
the 'Dream's End' ruined blitzball arena, where his father is.]

Jecht: "You're late, Auron."

Auron: "I know."

[Jecht turns to his son.]

Jecht: "Hey."

Tidus: "Hi."

Jecht: "Hah! You got tall, but you're all bones! You eating right, boy? You've
       really grown."

Tidus: "Yeah, but you're still bigger."

Jecht: "Well, I am Sin, you know."

Tidus: "That's not funny."

Jecht: "Well, then... I mean...you know. Let's end this."

Tidus: "Dad?"

Jecht: "Yeah?"

Tidus: "I hate you."

Jecht: "I know, I know. You know what you have to do."

Tidus: "Yeah."

Jecht: "I can't hear the Hymn so well anymore. Pretty soon, I'm gonna be Sin.
       Completely. I'm glad you're here now. One thing, though... When it
       starts, I won't be myself anymore. I won't be able to hold myself back.
       I'm sorry."

Tidus: "That's enough. Let's finish this, okay?"

Jecht: "You're right. Well, then... Let's go!"

[Jecht stumbles off the edge of the platform and turns into Braska's Final
Aeon.]

Tidus: "I promise this'll be quick! Hit me with all you got, Dad!"

[They defeat Jecht in his transformed state. Jecht appears back in the arena,
human, after it's done. Tidus cradles him.]

Jecht: "You'll cry. You're gonna cry. You always cry. See? You're cryin'."

[FMV. Tidus cries.]

Tidus: "I hate you, Dad."

Jecht: "Save it for later."

Tidus: "Right... We've got a job to do, don't we?"

Jecht: "Good. That's right. You are my son, after all."

Tidus: "You know...for the first time, I'm glad...to have you as my
       father."

Jecht: "Heh.

Yuna: "Sir Jecht... I should..."

Jecht: "No, Yuna, there's no time!"

[Yu Yevon makes an appearance, flying around the arena.]

Tidus: "You stay away!"

Jecht: "Yuna, you know what to do. The aeons..."

Fayth: "We aeons..."

[The boy fayth appears.]

Jecht: "Call them!"

Fayth: "Call us!"

[Jecht turns to pyreflies.]

Yuna: "Yes."

Lulu: "Here it comes!"

[Yu Yevon brings the party to a new location.]

Tidus: "Yuna!"

[After defeating Yuna's aeons, Yu Yevon, who looks like a tick, appears
to fight for himself.]

Tidus: "Everyone! This is the last time we fight together, okay?"

Wakka: "Huh?"

Tidus: "What I'm trying to say is...after we beat Yu Yevon, I'll disappear!"

Lulu: "What are you talking about?"

Tidus: "I'm saying goodbye!"

Rikku: "Not now!"

Tidus: "I know it's selfish...but this is my story!"

[The party beats Yu Yevon. Besaid is shown, with rejoicing villagers gathered
around a bonfire. The Aurochs and Chocobo Knights are there, Maechen, too.
Inside the nearby chamber of the fayth, the fayth changes into a plain stone
carving. The same thing happens in all fayth chambers, and soon the Bahamut
fayth that Tidus had known disappears.]

[Meanwhile, inside Sin, Yuna is sending Auron. She hesitates momentarily.]

Auron: "Don't stop.

Yuna: "But I..."

Auron: "It's all right. It's been long enough. This is your world now."

[Auron finally gets sent. Outside, Sin's body falls out of the air and sends
a large shockwave over the sky as it explodes. The airship survives, and they
all watch the summons disappear into pyreflies. On Mt. Gagazet, the gigantic
fayth there turns to stone, and the large waterspout turns to droplets. On
the airship, Tidus starts to fade away.]

Tidus: "Yuna, I have to go. I'm sorry I couldn't show you Zanarkand."

[Tidus looks at his sad comrades.]

Tidus: "Goodbye!"

Wakka: "Hey!"

Rikku: "We're gonna see you again...?"

[Yuna runs after Tidus.]

Kimahri: "Yuna!"

[She runs to him, but he has no substance, so she passes through him.]

Yuna: "I love you."

[Tidus wraps his arms around Yuna despite his lack of physical form, and
runs off the ship. He sees Braska and Auron as he freefalls, and finally
his father, who slaps his hand. Later on, in Luca, Lulu comes to fetch
Yuna, who's standing on an empty dock whistling for Tidus.]

Lulu: "Yuna, it's time."

[This time around, Yuna stands in the stadium's maester's box, ready to give
a speech to everyone.]

Yuna: "Everyone...everyone has lost something precious. Everyone here has lost
      homes, dreams, and friends. Everybody... Now, Sin is finally dead. Now,
      Spira is ours again. Working together... Now we can make new home for
      ourselves, and new dreams. Although I know the journey will be hard, we
      have lots of time. Together, we will rebuild Spira. The road is ahead of
      us, so let's start out today. Just, one more thing... The people and the
      friends that we have lost, or the dreams that have faded..."

[A rapid-fire mix of important images from the game is shown, including the
kiss with Tidus. The screen blacks out and a lone pyrefly is shown flittering
about.]

Yuna: "Never forget them."

     scheduled to leave any day now."

Man: "You're the guy from the sea, right? I heard about you from Sir Luzzu."

Man: "Sin's toxin? Nah, you don't look sick. You must not have breathed in
     much of the stuff, ya? Guess being a blitz player means you can hold your
     breath pretty good. [2] "I wanted to be a blitzer way back when. I just
     couldn't hold my breath."

Nun: "Besaid's devotion to the teachings of Yevon is commendable. Still,
     there is much for a priestess such as I teach them.

Man: "The Besaid fabrics they make here are famous all over Spira! If I buy
     cheap and sell high, I'll be rolling in Gil in no time!"

Man: "Sin's struck Besaid Village so many times I lost count. After this
     house got hit, I guess the owner just let it be. [2] "Sin will just come
     back and destroy it again. Sometimes I wonder why I bother.

Man: "I heard the Sin toxin got to you. Took your memory, eh? I'd be happy to
     teach you anything you've forgotten, sonny."
     R1 --> What's Sin?
     R2 --> What's toxin?
     R3 --> What's Yevon?
     R4 --> What's Zanarkand?
     R5 --> No, thanks, gramps.

     R1: "How could you forget Sin? I can't say I don't envy you, though.
         There's many who would give anything to forget the pain Sin has
         brought. Sin appearead a thousand years ago, a raging demon intent on
         reducing Spira to rubble. Everyone in Spira lives under Sin's black
         shadow. But to forget Sin...well, I'd consider yourself lucky, eh?"

     R2: "The foul vapors that boil from Sin's hide are evil indeed... One
         breath, and it will taint the very core of your body. People who get
         close to Sin forget even the most important things. Just like you,
         eh?"

     R3: "How wretched you must be, to have forgotten the teachings of Yevon!
         The teachings are the only salvation for those who suffer because of
         Sin. I'm sure you followed the teachings, before the toxin got to you,
         of course. Go pray at the temple, and all will return in time."

     R4: "Zanarkand was once a great city in the far north of this land. Now it
         lies in ruin, destroyed by Sin a thousand years ago. Such was its
         punishment for relying too much on machina.

         that's the truth!" [2] "I got better, but only after praying at the

Tidus: "I think so."
Gatta: "So, Sin can't be far, right? You're not hiding anything, are you?"
Tidus: "Why would I?"
Luzzu: "If Sin's nearby, it'll attack the island for sure. But it hasn't. I
       wonder why?"
Tidus: "I'm sorry. I really don't know anything. To tell the truth, I don't
       even know what the Crusaders are."
Gatta: "You're kidding, right?"
Luzzu: "Sin! The toxin! Gatta, tell him who we are!"
Gatta: "Yes, sir! The crusaders are sworn to battle Sin! We have chapters
       throughout Spira, accepting all who wish to join our struggle! The hero
       Mi'ihen formed the Crusaders eight hundred years ago as the Crimson
       Blades. Later, our ranks grew and we called ourselves the Crusaders.
       We've been fighting Sin ever since!"
Tidus: "What, you've been fighting eight hundred years and you still haven't
       beat it?"
Luzzu: "Well, we've steered Sin away from towns many times! And that's all we
       can do. Nobody's ever been able to defeat it. Our mission as Crusaders
       is to protect the temples, towns, villages, and people of Spira."
Tidus: "So then whose job is it to defeat Sin?"
Gatta: "Is Sin's toxin really this bad, sir?"
Luzzu: "It does seem rather bad... We could just tell you, but I think it
       better for you to try and remember. Go pray at the temple. Perhaps Yevon
       will help you regain your memory.

Luzzu: "We've been excommunicated from Yevon. We must go, now. Everything is
       riding on our next...our last battle!

Gatta: "But soon, we may be able to finally defeat Sin. We've got a plan -- one
       that'll go down in Crusader history!

       their own problems to worry about." [2] "Hey, I may not even be from
       around here. Maybe I come from someplace far away... Who knows?"

Vuroja: "If the Kilika Beasts win, it'll give the whole island something to
        celebrate. Thinking about that makes me want to practice harder.

Old Woman: "Hey, you! Hands off the merchandise! Oh, you're a customer, are
           you?

[In the pub:]

Man: "I don't care if there isn't any food. I just want to stay here. I'm
     scared to even look out at the sea. I can feel it out there, can't you?"

Kulukan: "I opened the store, but we can't serve anything because we don't
         have anything." [2] "All the food and drinks are at the bottom of
         the ocean. Sin took them all." [3] "You're the one who saved my
         sister, right? That treasure box contains a token of my
         appreciation. Please accept my thanks."

Girl: "Thanks for saving me. Our house fell down...but my big sister's here,
      so I'm real happy!" [2] "Hey, are you a blitzer? Good luck! I'm rooting
      for you!

[Outside, near inn:]

Man: "Everything is in shambles. I don't know where to start."

Old Man: "Our loved ones made it to the Farplane with Lady Yuna's help. We are
         truly grateful for Yevon's blessing." [2] "I'm sure my grandchildren
         made it to the Farplane in peace."

Man: "Yeah, I'm repairing this now, but it'll all be destroyed when Sin comes
     again. He destroys it, I fix it. I fix it and he destroys it. It's a
     neverending cycle, I tell you.

Woman: "I wanted to believe it was just a bad dream. That this was all a
       dream and when I opened my eyes, everything would be back to normal.
       But, when morning came, nothing had changed." [2] "Daddy..."

Man: "Hey! Wakka's waitin' for you!"

[In a house:]

Isken: "What are you lookin' at? I ain't on display here! Go away, man.""

Woman: "Please excuse him. He's been affected by the toxin. So if he says
       anything offensive, don't take it too seriously."

[In the Kilika Woods:]

Narrative: Something is written here.

           J L U E I

Man: "On our way, sir!"

Man 2: "Yes, sir! On our way, sir!"

Soldier: "Good day, guardians! Many fiends have been sighted in areas attacked
         by Sin. Please be careful on your journey. [Obtain: Hi-Potion] [2]
         "Every Crusader must pray for the fiends' souls. We all want the dead
         to find peace on the Farplane, right?" [3] "Fiends are everywhere.
         Never let your guard down.

Soldier: "We Crusaders are training for the upcoming operation. Call on us if
         you see any sinspawn." [2] "Are you heading for Kilika Temple? Then
         just follow this trail. There are poisonous fiends in the forest. Be
         on your guard!" [Obtain: Remedy] [3] "I'd steer clear of Ochu, Lord
         of the Wood. It's a powerful fiend that even we Crusaders avoid."

Gatta: "Standing guard, sir!"

Luzzu: "The Ochu is no garden-variety fiend. We could throw a hundred Crusaders
       at it and still lose." [2] "Ochu poison is a surefire way to get to the
       Farplane, and fast." [Obtain: Antidote x 4]

[After defeating Lord Ochu:]

Luzzu: "Do your best, kid. Wakka's counting on you." [Obtain: Elixir]

Gatta: "Hey, after the tournament, you should join the Crusaders!

Soldier: "I can't believe you defeated Ochu! Say, how would you like to join
         the Crusaders? Here's a little something for your victory." [Obtain:
         NulBlaze Shield]

[At temple steps, after the rest race up:]

Lulu: "Kids..."

[At the temple mount:]

Datto: "You sure are talented, man. Playing blitzball and fighting like that!"
       [2] "I came here last year to pray for victory, but we lost in the
       first round. I guess I didn't pray hard enough, ya?"

Letty: "So this is the place remembered in honor of High Summoner Ohalland...
       Makes you kind of nervous, ya?" [2] "All these flames around the
       temple... They've always burned strong, ever since High Summoner
       Ohalland's time.

Man: "Climbing those stone steps every day has kept me in shape. Haven't
     caught a cold in years."

Man: "I'm going to pray real hard so that Sin doesn't come back here."

Man: "I hear the Crusaders are going to fight Sin without the aid of a
     summoner. Heh, they've got another thing coming. Haven't they ever heard
     of divine retribution?"

Woman: "I've had enough of Kilika. Too many tearful memories here. We came to
       visit the temple one last time before we leave for good.

Man: "We decided to leave Kilika, and look for a place without Sin. Who knows
     if we'll ever find it."

Woman: "I heard famous people come here. Where could they be?"

[At the temple mount, after meeting the Goers:]

Datto: "My poor knees were shaking when the Goers confronted me."

Letty: "That was Bickson. He's a jerk, but a first-rate blitzer."

Man: "I used to be a blitzer back in my day. Always vying with the other
     teams."

Man: "The Goers and the Aurochs are going down! I guarantee you, the Beasts
     are gonna take home the cup this year!

Man: "Seeing blitzball players here is a sure sign that the tournament is
     approaching."

Woman: "I just saw a summoner and her guardian enter the Cloister of Trials."

Man: "The Goers look like a pretty good team, but they're so stuck up, aren't
     they?"

Woman: "Wait a minute. Could they have been the celebrities?

[In the monks' chambers:]

Monk: "May the Kilika Beasts win this year's tournament...and serve as a sign
      of encouragement for the people of Kilika."

Mep: "Kilika Temple is the temple of fire. Even the Cloister of Trials is
     engulfed in flames. Those who disobey the precepts and enter unsanctioned
     may forfeit their lives.

[In the nuns' chambers:]

Girl: "I'm supposed to study real hard and become a nun. But I just wanna run
      around and play at the beach."

Girl: "Guess what? I really like studying the scriptures! The monks give us
      lots of sweets if we study hard!"

[Inside the temple's great hall:]

Lulu: "I think Wakka needs to do a little more praying."

Yuna: "Please, let Wakka's prayers be heard."

Deim: "I envy your happy-go-lucky attitude."

Nizarut: "Yeah! Once we win the tournament, this will be my victory pose!"

[After meeting Dona:]

Deim: "Are you a blitzer? Or a guardian? Don't tell me you're both!"

Nizarut: "Yeah! Teamwork and trust are key elements for both guardians and
         blitzers!

Wakka: "Lord Ohalland, guide our feet."

[In the antechamber past the Cloister:]

Wakka: "Just wait."

[Back in Kilika, in the screen with the inn front:]

Man: "A summoner named Dona passed through here a while ago. She'll probably
     be taking the ferry." [2] "That Dona's an attractive lady, but she's a
     little on the cold side, if you know what I mean."

Woman: "The sea sure looks beautiful from here, but Sin's lurking out there,
       somewhere. It gives me the creeps just thinking about it."

Man: "There's not a smile in all of Kilika, thanks to Sin. But if we win the
     next tournament, that should cheer everyone up."

Old Man: "Sin is a divine punishment upon the people. There is nothing we can
         do about it. We can only rely upon Yevon's teachings and the summoners
         to help us through this.

[In the inn:]

Clerk: "We're still cleaning up here. Uh... Shouldn't you be on your way?"

[In the screen with the pub front:]

Larbeight: "We're off to Luca as soon as I finish this off." [2] "Just wait
           and see. We'll win for sure."

Old Woman: "Hey, you! Hands off the merchandise! Oh, you're a customer, are
           you?" [Buy/sell screen opens.]

[In the belowdeck cabin:]

Datto: "Tournament's coming up real soon. I wish we had more time to practice
       ya?"

Jassu: "I just wanna sneak up behind them and beat the... I mean, I wanna get
       in their faces and show 'em what we're made of!"

Letty: "Why do we have to be on the same ship as those Lucans anyway?"

Keepa: "Urgh... Why do I feel like I'm being watched?"

Botta: "Those herbs I bought in Kilika for seasickness are working great, ya?"

Abus: "Looks like our gals are brewing up something back there. I'd be afraid
      if I were you."

Balgerda: "My, you're kind of cute, too. Wanna have some fun?"

Doram: "Hey, that boy in the Aurochs is a cutie.

[In the hallway:]

Luzzu: "It might not mean much, but good luck in the tournament.

Gatta: [Luzzu replies for his sleeping friend:] "Best to let him sleep."

Dona: "Some people can be so rude."

Oaka: "But someday, the name O'aka will be spoken all over Spira! Say, lad,
      you wouldn't have a bit o' Gil to lend?"
      R1 --> Yes
      R2 --> No

      R1: [You can lend money to O'aka.]

          O'aka: "Ye really gonna lend me 100 Gil?"
          R3 --> Wait a minute.
          R4 --> No sweat.
          R5 --> Cancel.

      R2: "Eh, it figures."
      R3: [Can toggle Gil amount]
      R4: "I guess it pays to ask! Thank ye kindly, lad! Fine seed money for
          the O'aka merchant empire!
      R5: "Should've expected as much."

[Topside:]

[Tidus can walk over to Yuna's crowd.]
Tidus: "What are you all talking about?"
Bickson: "Who are you supposed to be?"
Graav: "Ah, I remember him. Guy from Kilika."
Bickson: "Hmm?"
Graav: "You know, one of the Besaid Aurochs. Said somethin' about winning
       the cup."
Bickson: "Oh, right. You're that idiot."
Yuna: "Don't call him that!"
Bickson: "But he is an idiot. They don't got what it takes to win the cup."
Tidus: "Well, they do now that I'm here!"
Yuna: "Yes, they will win! He used to be the star player for the Zanarkand
      Abes!"
Graav: "Yeah, as if anyone lived in those ruins."
Yuna: "It's not ruins, there's a big city there! There is!"
Tidus: "I-I got too close to Sin and--"
Yuna: "There is a city, really!"
Bickson: "Right. Whatever your Ladyship says."
[The Goers leave.]

             ---

Tidus: "What's wrong? You seemed kinda mad back there."
Yuna: "They were being rude and... I do believe your Zanarkand exists. I
      really do, you know!"
Tidus: "How come?"
Yuna: "Sir Jecht used to always tell me stories. It'd be great to see your
      home someday. I'd love to go there."
Tidus: "Yeah."
T-Narrative: So, Yuna, wanna come over to my place? Right, sure... As if I
             had a place to show her.

[In the bridge:]

Man: "We're doing double duty on the watch to avoid ending up like the
     S.S. Liki. Report to us immediately if you see any signs of Sin."
     [2] "This ship is just a ferry. We're doomed if we run into Sin."

Captain: "No offense, but I'm a diehard Luca Goers fan. Good luck, pal.
         You're gonna need it." [2] "Maybe you're better off asking the
         Goers to coach you."

[In the bridge, after the Goers go belowdeck:]

Man: "We have two summoners and the Goers onboard. It is my responsibility
     to carry them safely to their destination. [2] "What, the Besaid
     Aurochs? They're more like cargo."

Captain: "No offense, but I'm a diehard Luca Goers fan. Good luck, pal.
         You're gonna need it." [2] "Maybe you're better off asking the
         Goers to coach you."

[Topside, after the Goers go belowdeck.]

Yuna: "I do believe your Zanarkand exists. I really do, you know!"

Man: "The Aurochs are the team to watch this year. They say they got a
     blitzer from Zanarkand on their team!"
Woman: "Oh, come on! You actually believe that rumor?"
Man: "Ha! No way. I only meant it'll be fun to watch."

Man [2]: "That guy poking around back there is taking sphere shots of Lady
         Yuna." [2] "You're a blitzer from Zanarkand, right? At least put up
         a good fight, you hear me?"

Woman [2]: "Zanarkand, eh...? If you're going to bluff, say something a little
           more believable." [2] "You've got nerve to say you're from
           Zanarkand. Go home and relearn Yevon's teachings."

Jassu: "We can finally relax now that the Goers are down in the cabin." [2]
       "Don't mind Kimahri for not answering you. He's the silent type, you
       know?"

Datto: "Looks like the toxin's still getting to you. Take it easy and go to
       bed early, ya?" [2] "We wanted to have our final practice in Kilika,
       but that's impossible after what happened to the place."

Letty: "Wakka is busy right now. Maybe you shouldn't bother him." [2] "Let's
       pray we don't have to go against the Goers until the finals!"

[Cabin, after Goers go down:]

Botta: "I-It's terrible! Those Lucans dragged off Keepa! I...I hope I'm next."

Abus: "They say you come from the ruins. Hehehe... The Aurochs gotta be
      desperate to depend on some wacko."

Graav: "Let's see them moves you've learned in those ruins then!"

Bickson: "Yo, mister star player from Zanarkand! Take it easy on us today."

Doram: "Now, what should we play next?"

Balgerda: "What? You want to hang out with us? Hmm... Maybe later."

Keepa: "H-Help!"

[Topside, after attempting/getting the Jecht Shot:]

Jassu: "I'm gonna tell Botta and Keepa all about that shot you just did.
       They'll be so mad when they find out what they missed!" [2] "I'm glad
       the Goers weren't here to see it. Let's keep it secret until the
       finals!"

Datto: "I feel a little nervous with Lady Yuna watching us, ya?" [2] "Yeow...
       I hurt my back."

Letty: "Is Datto alright? It's right before the big game and all." [2] "That
       was one amazing shot you just did! They don't call you an ace for
       nothin'."

Wakka: "I knew it! I knew you were somethin' special!"

Man: "I'll bet you anything the Luca Goers are gonna win again this year."
Man 2: "Maybe so, but you'd better not count out the Kilika Beasts!"

Man [2]: "The Besaid Aurochs? Win?"
Man 2: "Now that's funny! Hahaha!"
Man: "Gimme a break, man!"

Woman: "Maester Mika has ruled Spira for the past fifty years.

Man: "Maester Mike doesn't make many public appearances. He's getting too
     old for that."

Man: "I'm glad I got here safely. Don't want another S.S. Liki incident."

Man: "If I can catch one glimpse of Maester Mika, I'll have something to brag
     about back home."

Man: "Man, this tournament is gonna rock! Even the big man is here to see the
     game!

Guard: "We have sealed off all access to the stadium for the time being. We're
       trying to control the mad rush of people who have already entered the
       stadium." [2] "We apologize for the incovenience, but access to the
       stadium has been sealed off."

Lulu: "It's crowded out there. Stay close."

Jassu: "I know we only need to win twice, but that's the problem." [2] "We've
       never made it past the first round! I'm gettin' the jitters."

Botta: "Only five players in the sphere pool, ya? Which of us is warmin' the
       bench?" [2] "People are here from Besaid, you know. We gotta win for
       them!"

Keepa: "Play to win, play to win, play to win... Gotta keep reminding myself,
       ya?" [2] "I'll make all the saves, so you just go out and shoot!"

Datto: "You come back real soon. We are really countin' on you." [2] "I wish
       I had a big net for all the butterflies in Wakka's stomach. I hope he's
       okay."

Letty: "No lookin' back now, ya? We just wait for the game!" [2] "W-We play to

Kilika Beast: "You sure are taking it easy. The opening match is about to
              start, you know.

Kilika Beast: "Hey, the Aurochs' locker room is on the other side. Or are you
              just here to scout?"

Female Ronso: "Aurochs... Don't underestimate Ronso skill."

Kid: "Yes! The season opener is finally here! Can you feel the excitement in
     the air? It's like the calm before a storm. In just a few minutes, this
     place is gonna go crazy!" [2] "It's like I'm feeding off the energy of
     the players!"

Man: "I just want to wish the Goers luck, but security won't let me in."

Kid: "Guess what, guess what? I shook Bickson's hand!"

Old Woman: "I've been a huge Goers fan since I was a little girl. I can still
           cheer as loud as the young'uns!" [2] "The players should be coming
           out soon."

Girl: "This guard is so mean! He won't let me in to see Sir Graav!" [2] "I
      don't care if I have to wait for hours! I'm not moving until I see Sir
      Graav!"

STADIUM ENTRANCE AND THEREABOUTS

Biggs: "No admittance!" [2] "We are sorry, but not even blitzball players are
       allowed to pass."

Wedge: "No admittance!" [2] "We are sorry, but not even blitzball players are
       allowed to pass."

Crusader: "Once the tournament is over, the operation will commence. Better
          enjoy blitzball while I still can." [2] "I hope the operation
          succeeds. I want to come back here next year..."

Crusader: "The Crusaders were in charge of guarding the stadium up until last
          year. But they're all busy preparing for the operation now. So this
          year, the citizens have taken up security posts."

Crusader: "I should be reporting to the base by now, but I just want to catch
          one glimpse of the opening ceremony."

Man: "The Goers are definitely gonna win. Everyone else is goin' down!"

Man: "Aren't you a blitzer? Better check the rules while you still can."

Guard: "The stadium is surrounded by numerous ports laid out in a circular
       fashion. So it's impossible to get lost. Turn here to get to dock
       number 5."

Woman: "Players must return to their locker room for the opening ceremony."

Man: "Tickets were so hard to come by this year. Oh, well... Guess I'll watch
     the game over at the cafe."

Man: "Even the ships don't leave the port during the tournament. Just kick
     back and relax, man."

Crusader: "I'm rooting for the Al Bhed Psyches this year. They're helping out
          the Crusaders, you know.

Guard: "The stadium is surrounded by numerous ports laid out in a circular
       fashion. So it's impossible to get lost. Turn here to get to dock
       number 1."

Guard: "Please report any suspicious activity."

Woman: "I saw your rallying cry on the sphere. Heheh, best of luck to you."

Clerk: "The opening ceremony is about to begin. All players must wait in their
       locker rooms.

DOCK NUMBER ONE

Guard: "A ferry bound for Kilika is anchored here at dock number 2." [2]
       "Patrolling a large structure such as this would be next to impossible.
       That is why we have a guard stationed at every dock."

Big Ronso: "Ice and snow from the holy peaks of Gagazet have strengthened
           Ronso spirit. The Ronso Fangs will win the cup. Any Ronso know
           that." [2] "The valiant Ronso Fangs have sworn victory on their
           horns. Ronso never break promise."

Little Ronso: "We come all the way from Gagazet. Ronso will surely win!" [2]
              "The Ronso Fangs are the strongest. They will not be defeated!"

Nedus: "Hudrehk paydc blitz! E fecr oui milg." ["Nothing beats blitz! I wish
       you luck!"]

O'aka: "The stores in the stadium are closed during the tournament. But I'm

       R9: "Should've expected as much."

O'aka: "The people here are so into the game, they don't even look at
       what they're buying! Gotta love blitz, eh?"

O'aka [2]: "Welcome to O'aka's!" [Same options applied.]

DOCK NUMBER TWO

Guard: "The ferry docked here is headed for Kilika Port." [2] "Dock number 3

Man: "I'm sorry, sir, but the ferry will remain at anchor for a little while."

DOCK NUMBER THREE

Guard: "A watchman is posted at every dock for your safety." [2] "To my left
       is dock number 2 and to my right is dock number 4."

Warrior Monk: "I am patrolling the area!"

Warrior Monk: "Don't confuse us with those heathen Crusaders. Warrior monks
              are the true defenders of Yevon!"

Guado: "Seems like they scaled back security this year. Hope nothing bad
       happens."

Guado: "Lord Seymour will lead the Guado to eternal repose."

Warrior Monk: "I'm terribly sorry, but no one is allowed to board this ship."

Shaami: "I am reporting to you live, from outside Luca Stadium. The
        excitement has reached a feverish pitch as the opening ceremony gets

        [2] "Hm? You want me to interview you? It's not like the Aurochs are

        interview when we already know the outcome?" [3] "Well, if you win at
        least one game, I'll grant you an interview."

Woman: "Don't you think it's disrespectful for the Al Bhed to play in the Yevon
       Cup?"

Monk: "The people are indulging in merrymaking, but we must keep in mind
      that... I will spare you the lecture."

Woman: "I'm keeping a close eye on the Al Bhed Psyches this year.
Woman 2: "Ewww... Why would you root for the Al Bhed? You really do have bad
         taste."
Woman: "I like how they cover up their faces. It's just so sexy and
       mysterious."

Woman 2 [2]: "Well, I would have to say it's the Ronso Fangs for me."
Woman: "The Ronso? They're just a bunch of meatheads!"
Woman 2: "And that's why the other teams are dead meat!"

Woman [2]: "What? The Besaid Aurochs? Oh, come on. Seriously?

Cameraman: "Hey, well if it isn't the Aurochs comedian. Thanks for that comic
           relief! Keep up the antics throughout the tournament. I'll be sure
           to capture you on sphere." [2] "The opening ceremony's about to
           begin. Shouldn't you be heading back?"

Man: "I really don't care which team wins or loses. I just want to watch the
     game and go crazy.

Guard: "The Sphere Theater is up ahead. Please enjoy revisiting all the
       wondrous sights and sounds you've encountered along your journey."

Man: "Hey, kiddo, got an extra ticket? I'll buy it off you! Or how about I
     sell ya front row tickets for you and the young lady?" [2] "Huh, you're

     row tikets here! Sell your unwanted tickets here!"

Man: "I feel bad for the Crusaders. They can't even stick around and watch
     the gaem because of the operation.

Man: "You're that newbie from the Aurochs, right? Good luck to you!"

Woman: "Is it true that the ferry is out of service?"
Fat Man: "I hear Sin may still be lurking in the sea nearby."
Woman: "At this rate, who knows when we'll make it back to Kilika?"

Woman [2]: "The Crusaders are blustering on about destroying Sin, but,
           heh... I doubt they will."

Fat Man [2]: "I just wish the summoners would end this, already.

Man: "Hey, did you see the lady summoner? What was she like?"

Man: "How can you not be excited when the tournament's about to start
     soon?"

Nun: "You think I stand out in this temple attire? Perhaps I should
     change?"

Woman: "I wonder how it'll turn out this year?"
Boy: "Well, duh! Of course the Goers are gonna win."
Woman: "Psshhh! I know that! What I man is, how many goals will Bickson
       score?"

Woman [2]: "Yeah, Bickson's gonna lead the Goers to victory as usual.
           But you know, Graav's been doin' well lately. Maybe he'll be
           the tournament MVP."
Boy: "No way! I'm cheering for Bickson all the way! He is and will
     always be number one.

Woman [3]: "Oh, yeah? Well, my sister's friend's boyfriend is Graav's
           cousin!"
Boy: "Well, I know a guy who's best friends with Bickson's younger

     R1: [Can buy music spheres.]
     R2: "Just as the name implies, it is a sphere that plays music,
         performed by the Yevon Musical Troupe. Each sphere contains one
         song. You will also need to use the audiovisual control panel found

     R2: "It's a sphere that can record images from the past that stand out in
         your mind. The images are saved onto a Movie Sphere. It follows the
         same basic principles as sphere cameras, or monitors: it captures the
         moment, so to speak. However, the Movie Sphere differs mainly in that
         it records images from the past rather than the present. You will
         also need to use the audiovisual control panel found in the main hall.

        interviewing eyewitnesses, but nobody seems to know a thing."

Cameraman: "Sorry, but we're broadcasting the news about the fiend attack."

Woman: "I can't believe the fiends would attack right in front of the maester,
       of all people. Just goes to show you that there is absolutely no safe
       haven in Spira."

Short Guy: "Fiend attack? So what! Big deal. Everyone'll soon forget about it

     it!"

Man: "The Kilika Beasts couldn't play up to their potential this year. Can't
     blame 'em, though. Their island was recently attacked by Sin, after all."

Woman: "So how did those fiends break into the stadium?""
Woman 2: "The authorities have no idea. They can only assume they just popped
         out of nowhere."

Woman [2]: "Who knows what would have happened if Maester Seymour hadn't been
           there..."
Woman 2: "Maester Seymour is our saviour."

Nun: "The Crusaders are devising a sacrilegious operation. I hear they may be
     collaboratin with the Al Bhed.

Monk: "Glory be to Maester Seymour's aeon, for keeping the destruction to a
      minimum. A blessing from Yevon, indeed."

Man: "The power of Maester Seymour's aeon was just incredible. I can see why
     he was appointed a maester at such a young age."

Woman: "Up until last year, it was the Crusaders who were in charge of
       security. If they had been here this year, the fiends would never have
       appeared."

Man: "The Aurochs really improved this year, but their success was overshadowed
     by the fiend incident."

Lulu: "You're a real guardian now, so no mistakes. Understood?"

Wakka: Where'd you meet Sir Auron, anyway?"
       R1 --> I'm not telling.
       R2 --> Zanarkand

       R1: "Ah, never mind. Anyway, I knew you'd find someone you knew here."
       R2: "Sin's toxin sure is taking its time wearing off. Anyway, I knew
           you'd find someone you knew here."

Wakka [2]: "We'll be taking the Mi'ihen Highroad north, toward Djose Temple."

Auron: "Remember, you're suffering from Sin's toxin. Don't say otherwise."

[After the party leaves and re-enters:]

Old Woman: "I tried to stop the Crusaders, but I tell you, those youngsters
           won't listen to anybody!" [2] "I fear Sin will crush them and
           teach them just how futile repentance is then."

Man: "Their owner's a crusader. I'm only looking after 'em while the
     operation's going on." [2] "I'd hate to see these fellas left on
     their own. I hope their owner returns safely."

Crusader: "Nothing you say will sway us. The Crusaders will proceed
          with the operation as planned." [2] "I am well aware of the
          risks of this mission. But we cannot simply run away.

Keepa: "We won! That means we're the team to watch out for. Unbelievable."

Botta: "I still have lots to learn from Wakka. I wish he'd come back."

Letty: "It's not the same without you, man. Come back anytime, ya?"

Datto: "Yes! Thank you! We beat the Goers all because of you, man."

Jassu: "Still can't believe we won, man... Have to keep pinching myself."

Man: "The Aurochs won the tournament. It must be some kind of mistake."
Woman: "I agree! The authorities should drop the fiend investigation and look
       into this first!"

Cameraman: "Hey, congratulations! I got everything on the sphere. Never in my
           wildest dreams did I think the Besaid Aurochs would win the cup.

Shaami: "Do you know anything about the fiends inside the stadium? We have so
        few facts, we can't write up a feature on it yet." [2] "I've been
        interviewing eyewitnesses, but nobody seems to know a thing." [3] "Oh
        yes, congratulations! I have a lot more respect for the Aurochs now."

Woman: "So, how did all those fiends break into the stadium?"
Woman 2: "The authorities have no idea. They can only assume they just popped
         up out of nowhere."

Woman [2]: "Who knows what would have happened if Maester Seymour hadn't been
           there..."
Woman 2: "Maester Seymour is our saviour."

Woman [3]: "I was really surprised by the sudden fiend attack, but you know
           what shocked me the most?"
Woman 2: "The Aurochs winning the tournament? Yeah, I still can't believe it."

Man: "This is the first time I've ever seen the Aurochs win!"

Woman: "Most of the Crusaders that guard our city have gone off to
       that 'operation.' Luca is defenseless! Whatever will we do if

[If the Aurochs win:]

Bickson: "Our biggest mistake was going too easy on you Aurochs. We
         won't hold back next time."

Abus: "We thought you'd be a pushover. You Aurochs sure have improved!"

Graav: "I consider your victory a total fluke."

Raudy: "We're just lending you the trophy until next year's tournament.
       Keep it nice and shiny for us."

Balgerda: "How could we lose to the Aurochs, of all teams? This is a
          disgrace!"

Doram: "We didn't lose to the Aurochs, we lost to Wakka's spirit and
       dedication."

[If the Aurochs lose:]

Bickson: "We Luca Goers will always be on top. Crawl your way up if you
         think you can."

Abus: "Another tournament, another victory... But no parade, thanks to
      those fiends."

Graav: "Just be grateful that your twenty-three-year losing streak is

Raudy: "How can the Aurochs be runners-up? The competition these days

Gazna Ronso: "Many Ronso return home to mountain. But Ronso Fangs will
             stay in Luca.

Basik Ronso: "Best of luck to the Besaid Aurochs. The Ronso Fangs will be
             waiting."

STADIUM INTERIOR

Ronso Woman: "Ronso warriors value their horns, and the people of
             Luca value blitzball." [2] "True believers of the teachings
             will not support the Crusaders."

Guard: "Even with the recent fiend scare, I can't believe how crowded
       it is." [2] "It's too bad the Aurochs' record losing streak had
       to end. That was the only thing going for them."

Guard: "The fiends broke in, all because the Crusaders ditched guard
       duty this year. It's all their fault! They should have been
       helping us instead of devising some foolish plan!" [2] "The
       Crusaders are dreamin'! Do they really think the operation will
       succeed?"

Guard: "We no longer have the strength to fight... Should the fiends
       reappear, run for your lives!" [2] "Thanks to the citizens
       pitching in, the stadium has been repaired in no time."

Ronso Woman: "Many Ronso have left Luca to guard their sacred mountain,
             Gagazet." [2] "Throughout the long history of Yevon, this
             is the first time a summoner has ever been appointed
             maester."

Man: "Those fiends really put a damper on the tournament." [2] "I was
     watching Maester Seymour's aeon from here. It was awesome!"

Man: "Games are held every day, even after the tournament." [2] "Maester
     Mika has already returned to Bevelle."

Man: "Please give this to the lady summoner as a token of my gratitude."
     [Obtain: Hi-Potion] [2] "The Crusaders are really active." [3] "I heard
     that Crusaders are marching in from all over Spira." [4] "Mum's the word.
     I hear the temples of Yevon are in on this, too."

Maechen: "This is a statue of Lord Mi'ihen. Eight centuries ago, he founded a
         legion known today as the Crusaders. In just a few short years after
         their founding, their ranks grew throughout Spira. The maesters of
         Yevon feared an uprising and accused them of rebellion. So Lord
         Mi'ihen walked along this very road to go face their charges and
         refute them. He succeeded in winning the maesters' trust, and his
         legion became an arm of the Yevon clergy. It was then that Yevon gave
         them the name 'Crusaders,' which they have kept ever since. And the
         rest is history." [2] "Although this is a highroad, fiends do appear.
         Be on your guard!"

         [After he speaks about the ruins up the road:]

         "Ah, Lady Yuna's guardians, I presume?"

Woman: "You're a guardian, right? I'd like to give you this." [Obtain:
       Antidote x 2] [2] "Where is he?" [3] "I got separated from my brother.
       I told him to meet here if that happened!" [4] "We have to get back home
       before the operation starts!"

Man: "Hey there, guardians. Here. Use this to defend the summoner well."
     [Obtain: Hunter's Spear] [2] "I hear some big operation's about to start."
     [3] "I don't know what the Crusaders are up to, but I say they're way out
     of their league. Let the summoners take are of Sin! It's the only way!"
     [4] "The Crusaders can't beat Sin. History's proven that."

Crusader: "This ring helps keep flames at bay. Please, give it to the lady
          summoner." [Obtain: Red Ring] [2] "Whaddya want! I'm in a hurry
          here!" [3] "They're going to kill me if I'm late for the operation!"

Crusader: "I stocked up on too many. Please take one, if you like." [Obtain:
          Antidote x 4] [2] "Once the order is given, I'll be fighting on the
          front line. That's everything we've trained for." [3] "High Summoner
          Yocun, who slew Sin, started as a Crusader." [4] "If I fight as
          valiantly as Lady Yocun, will I, too, receive Yevon's blessing?"

Woman: "There are lots of fiends, so stay sharp. Use this when the going gets
       tough." [Obtain: Hi-Potion] [2] "Do you see that sign? What a guady ad.
       They're way out of line." [3] "It's not good once those guys get
       going."

Crusader: "Here's a little something to cheer you up before the big fight."
          [Obtain: Lv. 1 Key Sphere] [2] "I'm gonna vanquish Sin and return
          home a hero." [3] "Us Crusaders... We're gonna make history with
          this operation. For the first time, people other than summoners
          will defeat Sin." [4] "No doubt we're gonna win. And just in case,
          we have an ace up our sleeves, too."

Crusader: "Providing is preventing. Need I say more? This'll help." [Obtain:
          600 Gil] [2] "The young guns believe everything will go as planned.
          We veterans know otherwise; it's not going to be easy." [3] "Of
          course, when the time comes, we'll march in full force to victory.
          Victory must be the goal to win any battle." [4] "They say luck
          decides the battle, but we can't afford to lose."

Lucil: "There have been reports of a large fiend appearing in this area, with
       a taste for chocobos. Do take care, Summoner Yuna, if you are to rent
       any chocobos."

Elma: "Our prayers are with you."

[In some ruins on the road:]

[If Tidus attacks an armored monster when Auron is in the battle:]

Auron: "I told you. Let me handle their kind."

Wakka: "Leave those hard-shelled ones to Sir Auron!"

Lulu: "Leave those to Sir Auron."

[Tidus can kick a blitzball into the brush.]

Kid: "Hey! That was my ball!" [2] "Gee, you really socked that puppy."
     [3] "Why don't you become a blitzer? Maybe someday you could play
     for the Goers?"

[If you talk to him before hitting it:]

Kid: "Watch out. There are fiends everywhere. Here, you can have this."
     [Obtain: Soft x 3] [2] "I'm watching the Crusaders pass by. They're
     cool." [3] "Should I become a Crusader or a blitzer when I grow up?
     I don't know." [4] "My sister's waiting for me, but who cares."

[A woman stands by some roadside ruins in the first screen.]

Woman: "Ah, a summoner party.
Yuna: "You, too, are a summoner?"
Belgemine: "My name is Belgemine. You are...?"
Yuna: "My name is Yuna."
Belgemine: "Ah, the high summoner's daughter. I've heard much of you. But you
           are still fresh on the road, are you not?"
Yuna: "Yes, I am."
Belgemine: "I might have a few things to teach you. Let us see which are
           stronger. My aeons or yours. A one-on-one match. Not to the death,
           of course. What do you say?"
           R1 --> Fight.
           R2 --> Pass.

           R1 (Yuna): "I'll do my best!"
              Belgemine: "Good. Before we begin..."
              [She heals Yuna's aeons.]
              Belgemine: "Your aeons have been healed. You can fight with your
                         full strength. Come."
              [They start to fight.]
              Belgemine: "Show me how strong of a link you've forged with your
                         aeons."
              Narrative: An aeon's attributes rise with those of its summoner.
                         Thus, the Ifrit one summoner calls may be very
                         different from one called by another summoner. Because
                         this Ifrit's strength and HP are both high, it will
                         win in a straight fight. Try fighting using your
                         aeon's Shield and Boost commands. Shield stops your
                         aeon's Overdrive gauge, but reduces the amount of
                         damage it recieves. Boost accelerates the Overdrive
                         gauge, but increases the amount of damage received.
                         Shield is best when you expect the enemy to hit your
                         aeon with a powerful attack. This Ifrit alternates
                         between Attack and Meteor Strike. A Meteor Strike is
                         coming up next, so defend your aeon with Shield!
              [Belgemine will say if she loses or wins, respectively:]
              Belgemine: "Stop. That is enough."
              Belgemine: "You have a lot to learn."

          R2: "Well, it's your decision."
              Yuna: "I'm sorry."
              Belgemine: "Tell me if you change your mind."

[If Yuna fights and wins:]

Belgemine: "Not bad for one so young. I underestimated you. Take this. You've
           earned it." [Obtain: Echo Ring] "You show promise. With more
           training, you could defeat Sin."

Yuna: "Thank you! But I think you might defeat Sin before I am able to."

Belgemine: "I cannot. Or should I say...I was not able to."

Yuna: "You mean..."

Belgemine: "Farewell, Yuna. We'll meet again."

[If Yuna fights and loses:]

Belgemine: "You need more training. But you did well." [Obtain: Seeker's Ring]
           "You show promise. With more training, you could defeat Sin."

Yuna: "Thank you! But I think you might defeat Sin before I am able to."

Belgemine: "I cannot. Or should I say...I was not able to."

Yuna: "You mean..."

Belgemine: "Farewell, Yuna. We'll meet again."

[The party can find Luzzu and Gatta down the road.]

Gatta: "Hey, we saw the game! You guys were great!"
Luzzu: "Congratulations, Wakka!"
Elma: "Hey! Stop loafing around!"
[The chocobo knights come over.]
Gatta: "Uh... The lady summoner and her guardians..."
Lucil: "This mission requires our full attention. We've no time to waste!
       Understood?"
Luzzu: "Yes, ma'am! Apologies, ma'am!"
Lucil: "Carry on."
[The chocobo knights leave.]
Luzzu: "See? Keep your head down, say 'sir' a lot, and you'll do fine."
Gatta: "Right...sir."
Luzzu: "Hey, Yuna. Even though Yevon rejected us...we still believe in you.
       That won't ever change."
Yuna: "Thank you, Sir Luzzu, Sir Gatta. But, you know... It's not too late for
      you to go back to Besaid, and..."
Gatta: "We should be going, sir!"
[They run off behind the chocobo cart.]

[The party can stumble upon a Yevonite and a Crusader having a quarrel:]

Crusader: "We'll defeat Sin any way we can!"
Woman: "But Yevon's teachings say..."
Crusader: "Enough!"
Woman: "I-I only meant to..."
[The Crusader leaves.]
Yuna: "Are you all right?"
Woman: "Lady Summoner...?"
Yuna: "Yes, I am Yuna.
Woman: "It is an honor, my lady. My name is Shelinda. I am a disciple of
       Yevon."
Wakka: "What was all that about? The Crusaders' operation?"
Tidus: "You mean the one Gatta and Luzzu were talking about?"
Shelinda: "I heard they were to use forbidden machina! I had to stop them."
Tidus: "Huh? Why?"
Lulu: "The use of machina is strictly forbidden by the Yevon priesthood."
Wakka: "That's bad, ya?"
Auron: "Let them use whatever they want. They still won't defeat Sin."
Shelinda: "But, it's not about defeating Sin! The teachings of Yevon must be
          upheld!"
Wakka: "Yeah! Right!"
Shelinda: "But you don't understand! The Crusaders won't even listen to me.
          And it's all because I'm just a lowly acolyte."
Yuna: "Don't say that. Well, I haven't been a summoner for very long myself,
      you see. Still, I can't put myself down every time I fail. People are
      depending on me. They're depending on both of us!"
Shelinda: "Yes! Yes, you're right, my lady. Absolutely right! Thank you so
          much, Lady Yuna! Now, I feel I have the courage to finish my
          training."

Shelinda [2]: "I will do my best to get myself appointed to a temple, as a
              nun."

Maechen: "Mr. Rin's shops are all over Spira. They are quite convenient when
         you're on the road."

Shelinda: "I've heard that the proprietor, Mr. Rin, is an Al Bhed. But I was
          very relieved to find that he keeps nothing sacrilegious here."

Lulu: "This might be the last time we can rest like this."

     Crusaders have sealed off the Highroad."

Woman: "There are so many things I want. I can't decide what to get." [2]
       "Say... Will you buy something for me?"
       R1 --> Buy something for her.

            R1 --> Let me ride one!

                you where you leave it unless you leave the Mi'ihen Highroad
                on foot or you rent another chocobo.

Maechen: "A safe journey to you!"

Shelinda: "Thank you so much for your words yesterday."

O'aka: "Coming down to the Oldroad was a mistake... Ye can't run a business
       with no customers! Say, can I interest you in something?"
       R1 --> Whatcha got?
       R2 --> Lend Gil to O'aka
       R3 --> No, thanks.

       R1: [Items are shown.]

       R8: "Should've expected as much."

O'aka: "Sure are a lot of Crusaders about. Wonder what they're up to?"

Lucil: "What are you doing down on this road?"
Tidus: "Oh, you know..."
Lucil: "I see. The Highroad ends over there. However, we have sealed off the
       area beyond for the duration of our operation here. You may ask the gate
       captain up ahead if you need to pass through.

Lucil [2]: "You must first go to the end of the Highroad in order to get back
           on the Newroad."

Shelinda: "Word has gotten around about me. Now all the Crusaders are ignoring
          me!"

[Once on a chocobo:]

Woman [2]: "Do you want me to teach you how to ride a chocobo?"
           R1 --> I'm okay.
           R2 --> Teach me.

           R1: "Please be careful on your trip."
           R2: [Controls as shown above are repeated.]

Crusader: "The Mushroom Rock Road is off-limits to non-Crusader personnel
          until the end of the mission!" [2] "We apologize for the
          inconvenience, but this road is closed!"

Kid: "We're Crusaders, too. We have a lot of work to do. My job is to clean
     up everyone's stuff!"
Kid 2: "And I'm delivering food for the soldiers!"
Kid: "Big job, huh?"

Kid [2]: "The operation's gonna start soon. All civilians must leave."
Kid 2: "What if you don't?"
Kid: "Then Sin's gonna eat you! Mom said Sin eats bad people."
Kid 2: "Yikes."

Kid 2: "A great maester is here, too, so we're gonna work really hard!"

Clasko: "Captain Lucil and Elma should have been here by now." [2] "What's
        taking Elma so long?

Crusader: "Any donation toward Operation Mi'ihen would be greatly
          appreciated!"
          R1 --> 100 Gil should be plenty.
          R2 --> I can afford 1,000 Gil.
          R3 --> It's your lucky day! 10,000 Gil!
          R4 --> I'd rather not.

          R1: "Thank you! Please accept this." [Obtain: Scout]
          R2: "Many thanks! This is for you." [Obtain: Ice Lance]
          R3: "Thank you for your generosity! Here, you should have
              this." [Obtain: Moon Ring]
          R4: [Dialogue cancelled.]

Crusader: "Hey, you're a summoner and her guardians, right? Sorry for the
          inconvenience."
          R1 --> Don't worry about it.
          R2 --> Tell me about the operation.

          R1: "Thank you for your cooperation!"
          R2: "What, they didn't tell you? We're bringing sinspawn from all
              over Spira here. Sinspawn inevitably draw Sin, right? We're
              going to lure it into a trap!"

Crusader [2]: "This mission, Operation Mi'ihen, is a Crusader-Al Bhed
              joint mission. We Crusaders lure Sin in, and the Al Bhed
              strike it down. You see, Al Bhed hate Sin as much as we do."
              [2] "They managed to salvage ancient machina. They say they're
              as powerful as the mighty aeons." [3] "Well, you know machina
              are forbidden by Yevon. Ah...on second thought, let's not go
              there. Better for you not to know. The Crusaders in Operation
              Mi'ihen have all been excommunicated. My own family won't even
              speak to me now." [4] "We have to beat Sin today. Otherwise,
              there's nowhere for us to go."

[The party can find Dona and Barthello confronting a Crusader.]

Dona: "How many times do I have to tell you? I'm a summoner!"
Crusader: "Sorry, ma'am! No exceptions!"
Dona: "You dare impede a summoner's pilgrimage?"
Crusader: "Sorry, ma'am! No exceptions!"
Dona: "Useless!"

[Tidus can walk over.]

Dona: "Oh, it's you. As you can see, not even summoners can pass. But they'll
      call on us in the end. Just wait and see. In the meantime, I think I'll
      have a nap. Oh, Barthello?" [They leave.]

[If you try to approach the entrance to Mushroom Rock Road, Clasko will say:]

Clasko: "You have to leave your chocobos here! Come on, everyone off!"

AFTER SEYMOUR ALLOWS YOU ENTRANCE

Crusader: "You may pass."

Clasko: "Captain Lucil and Elma should have been here by now."
        R1 --> Help him look for them.
        R2 --> I've got better things to do.

        R1: [You get on a chocobo and start looking. Lucil is on the Oldroad.
            Upon finding them, you appear back at the gate and the two report
            in.]

            Lucil: "Sir! Support units are in place. Mounted units have
                   finished all exercises. "
            Elma: "Evacuation of civilians almost complete, sir! Just a few
                  stragglers -- nothing to worry about, sir."
            Crusader: "Good. Were there any problems?"
            Lucil: "No problems, sir."
            Crusader: "Excellent! The first stage is complete, then! Chocobo
                      Knights -- to your assigned positions for Operation
                      Mi'ihen!"

Crusader: "Here, this should come in handy." [Obtain: Tough Bangle] [2] "We're
          sealing off this area for the operation. All passage will be denied."

Crusader: "Stay alert during your trip. I hope this helps." [Obtain: Ether] [2]
          "I guess we have Yevon's blessing, since the maester himself wished
          us good fortune." [3] "Who knows, Maester Seymour might even summon
          aeons and fight alongside us."

Crusader: "You must take full precautions here. Please use this if the need
          arises." [Obtain: Hi-Potion] [2] "Yevon did not forsake us after
          all. Now we can fight without regret." [3] "I've dispatched my men
          on patrol. Fiends have infested the area."

Crusader: "The Crusaders supplied us with some goods. Here you go." [Obtain:
          Phoenix Down x 2] [2] "Maester Seymour came to witness our deeds here
          today. We will destroy Sin, even if it means our lives!" [3] "I must
          relay Lord Seymour's message to the men. This will be great for
          morale!"

Clasko: "I'm just doing my job." [If you try to run past him:] "No, not this
        way. I guess I'm not good at explaining."

O'aka: "Good day, lad! Sneaked past the guards, I did!" [Got any weapons?/
       Got any items?/Leave.]
O'aka: "Be makin' a fortune with 'Operation Mi'ihen' prices! But you, lad,
       you get a discount! I owes ya one, eh?"

Crusader: "There is increasing fiend activity. This may not be much help,
          but..." [Obtain: Hi-Potion] [2] "Yevon's emblem bears mystic powers.
          Step onto that platform, and you shall see."

Crusader: "A summoner's entourage! Please accept this." [Obtain: Potion x 10]
          [2] "After the operation, my compadres and I are heading straight
          for Luca. It's gonna be a blast. We've already reserved a place and
          everything." [3] "Do you think Yevon will take us back if we
          succeed?"

Lucil: "We've been expecting you. Please proceed to the command center." [2]
       "The presence of a summoner and a maester is great for the troops'
       morale -- myself included. Thank you for being here, my lady." [3]
       "Depending on the way things turn out, we might suffer casualties. In
       such an event, we would be grateful if you could perform the sending,
       my lady." [4] "We may have to fight here, as well. Stay alert."

Shelinda: "In the end, I wasn't able to stop them, as you can see. But seeing
          their fierce determination, I couldn't just sit there. So I decided
          that I would do everything in my power to help them." [2] "Truly, I
          know nothing of the ways of fighting, but I do know some white magic.
          I'm hoping it will be of some use to them." [3] "Is there anything I
          can do to help you?"
          R1 --> We're fine.
          R2 --> Please heal us!

          R1: "Take care!"
          R2: [She heals the party.]

Elma: "Lady Summoner! What are you doing here?" [2] "Well, with your guardians
      near you, you shouldn't have anything to worry about." [3] "Don't say we
      shouldn't be using machina! Not now, please?" [4] "I hope Captain Lucil
      notices my efforts in this mission!"

Crusader: "Give this to the lady summoner, and grant us your help when the
          time comes." [Obtain: X-Potion] [2] "The command center is
          strategically located on a ledge overlooking the sea. It's just
          beyond the artillery base up ahead." [3] "We have neutralized all
          fiends around the command center. The sector is secure."

Crusader: "Be sure to make thorough preparations. Here, put this to good use."
          [Obtain: 400 Gil] [2] "We've concentrated our forces along the coast
          to prevent Sin from reaching land. We plan to stage a frontal
          assault. The men are preparing for the worst." [3] "My friend is
          stationed there. All I can do is pray for him."

Crusader: "We've secured the command center perimeter. But please take this
          as a precaution." [Obtain: Mega-Potion] [2] "This is a mechanical
          lift built by the Al Bhed. Please take it up to the command center."
          [3] "Relying on machines goes against the teachings, but the
          maester just used it."

[The two can come upon Luzzu and Gatta near the lift to the artillery base.]

Gatta: "Why only you, sir? I want to fight, too!"
Luzzu: "Orders are orders."
Gatta: "I'm not a cadet anymore, sir! Let me go with you, and I'll prove it to
       them!"
Luzzu: "Guarding the command center is important too, you know."
Gatta: "But I came all the way from Besaid to fight Sin, sir!"
Luzzu: "I know, but an order's an order. To your post, Crusader."
Gatta: "But, sir!"

[Gatta runs off. Tidus can walk over.]

Luzzu: "They let you through, huh?"
Tidus: "Gatta deserves better..."
Wakka: "At least there's no chance he'll get hurt. Why are you guys fighting
       anyway? Aren't the almighty Al Bhed machina enough?"
Luzzu: "They still need some time to get them ready. Our job is to keep Sin at
       bay till they're done. Wakka... I might not get another chance to say
       this. It's about your brother."
Lulu: "Luzzu, no!"
Wakka: "What?"
Luzzu: "I'm the one who convinced him...to enlist. I'm sorry."
[Wakka punches him.]
Tidus: "Wakka! That's enough, Wakka!"
Wakka: "When we used to play blitz together, Chappu used to say... He'd say
       that -- when we won the Cup, ya? -- he'd propose to Lulu. And then one
       day...he goes off and becomes a Crusader. Just like that."
Luzzu: "Chappu also said to me... That being with your girl is good... But
       keeping Sin far away from her is better."
Wakka: "Lu, you knew?"
Lulu: "Luzzu told me...before we left."
Luzzu: "She hit me, too."
[Lucil approaches.]
Lucil: "All Crusaders in the vanguard are to assemble on the beach!"
Luzzu: "That's my cue."
Wakka: "Luzzu! Don't die out there."
Luzzu: "So you can hit me more?"
Wakka: "Lots! Lots more!"
Yuna: "Sir Luzzu, please! Please, don't go!"
Luzzu: "I have to, Yuna."
Auron: "Let him go. The man has already chosen his path... As you did when
       you became a summoner."
[Luzzu leaves; fade to black]
T-Narrative: It would be a long time...before I ever really understood the
             reason why Yuna let Luzzu pass that day.

Crusader: "The cannon got out of place when we fired a test shot. Packed too
          much powder, I guess." [2] "I have to set her in place before the
          operation."

Crusader: "Once Sin emerges from the sea, we'll commence firing. Our shots
          should stun it long enough for the Al Bhed machina to finish it off."
          [2] "We just fired a test shot, and this puppy roars! It near knocked
          me out. Heck, it probably echoed as far as Luca!" [3] "Sin's gonna be
          a huge target. We probably won't even have to aim."

Crusader: "We're only moments away from commencing Operation Mi'ihen. Spira's
          fate hangs on the outcome of this mission. We will do our duty as
          soldiers and defeat Sin this day!
Crusaders: "Sir!"

Crusader [2]: "It's important to spur my men on every now and then. Maybe I
              should give them another pep talk to be sure..."

Crusader: "The captain just keeps repeating himself. He must be really
          nervous."

Crusader: "Man, you'd think he'd shut up after five times -- or was that six?"

Crusader: "That merchant's obviously ripping people off. I guess it can't be
          helped. He's the only game out here." [2] "I asked him for a
          discount, and do you know what he said to me? 'Ye gonna die anyway,
          so what's the point?'" [3] "I wonder what that merchant's gonna do
          when the battle starts.

Crusader: "We're inspecting the weapons right now." [2] "They're Al Bhed
          machina, so we have to be extra cautious." [3] "So far so good. I'm
          gonna run more tests.

Swordsman: "Come on! Swing like a man! Do you wanna avenge your sister or not?"
Li'l Kid: "I'm gonna beat Sin! I'm gonna beat it! I'm gonna beat it no matter
          what!"

Swordsman [2]: "Okay, come on now! Pretend I'm a fiend!"
Li'l Kid: "Die, die, die!

Crusader: "I'm short on various stuff, so I'm trying to buy them now.
          Everything seems to be pricier than usual." [2] "Well, I guess I
          should just be thankful. I never imagined I could buy stuff out
          here." [3] "Time to shop!"

Crusader: "Yeah? What do you want to know?"
          R1 --> About the cannons.
          R2 --> About the Chocobo Knights.
          R3 --> About this operation.
          R4 --> Never mind.

          R1: "The Al Bhed provided us with these cannons at no charge. I hate
              the bastards, but I've got a little respect for them now. These
              cannons have good range. We'll give Sin a shower it won't soon
              forget!"

          R2: "Only a select few can become Chocobo Knights. You have to be a
              skilled rider or achieve some combat merit to become one. Captain
              Lucil is no doubt the best of the bunch right now. I just don't
              know how that wimp Clasko got knighted. Well, he is good at
              earning their trust -- the chocobos, that is."

          R3: "We've researched Sin's past behaviors in planning this
              operation. Sin often turns up where its sinspawn are. So we
              hunted down the sinspawn at various places and brought them here
              to lure it. When it shows up, we're gonna hit it with the ancient
              machina, and it's bye-bye Sin. The Crusaders' responsibility is
              to lure Sin and immobilize it. The Al Bhed will deliver the
              finishing blow. I wish it could be the other way around, but as
              long as we defeat Sin, who cares."

          R4: [Cancels dialogue.]

O'aka: "Monopoly's a great thing! Things are sellin' no matter what the price!
       Oops! Sorry, I forgot." [Got any weapons?/Got any items?/Leave.]

Gatta: "Just doing what they say? It just won't be enough."
       R1 --> Yeah, you should be out on the front lines.
       R2 --> Guarding the command center is important, too."

OPERATION MI'IHEN AFTERMATH
###########################

[At the dead bodies, the following can be 'said':]

Narrative: Rest in peace.
Narrative: Slightly warm, but no sign of breathing.
Narrative: Staring at the sky, lifeless.
Narrative: Instant, painless death.

[Once Tidus and Auron have talked, and the party is down from the ridge:]

Lulu: "You were in contact with Sin again. The toxin -- are you okay?" [2]
      "Yuna was worried about you." [3] "You should let her know you're all
      right."

[After seeing Kinoc, Auron speaks with Tidus when he approaches.]

Auron: "Sin is Jecht."
Tidus: "Yeah, for a while there, I thought I could feel him. But that doesn't
       mean I believe you."
Auron: "Sin is Jecht. He came here for you."
Tidus: "So he killed all those people just for a chance to see me?"
Auron: "That's what Sin does. He wanted to show that to you. Do you know why?"
Tidus: "How am I supposed to know?"
Auron: "So you would kill him. As long as he is Sin, Jecht will keep killing.
       He wants you to stop him."
Tidus: "You've gotta be kidding. How do you know all of this, anyway?"
[Auron chuckles and walks away.]
Tidus: "I'm not done talking to you! Don't you run away!"
Auron: "You're the one running."

[After the party heads on:]

Crusader: "More than half of our frontline soldiers perished. My battalion was
          annihilated, too... The Crusaders will never rise again." [2] "We
          shouldn't have defied the teachings."

Crusader: "It wasn't supposed to end like this." [2] "Damn it! How many died

Crusader: "We've decided to rest at the temple. I just hope they let us. We've
          been excommunicated, after all. They might throw us out. Oh, I almost
          forgot. There are fiends here that petrify humans. Wear this; it
          should help." [Obtain: Soft Ring] [2] "My buddy's missing. We served
          in the same unit. I hope he's okay."

Crusader: "The Crusaders have been ordered to regroup at Djose Temple. Not many
          left to regroup, but..." [2] "It's my fault. My men died in vain

Crusader: "We incurred heavy casualties in last year's Djose coast defense

          hardly make amends, but... I want the lady summoner to have this."
          [Obtain: Ether] [2] "I guess it's time to seek the monks' help and

Monk: "As followers of Yevon, we believe in aiding all those who are wounded.
      Even the excommunicated Crusaders." [2] "They have suffered so much. I

Crusader: "You can't defeat Sin with machina. The summoners are our only hope.

          them. Here, take this. I don't need it anymore." [Obtain: Halberd]

          hard way."

Crusader: "The Crusaders have fallen apart, so I'm going to help out with
          guard duty here at the temple for a while. It's the least I can do
          to repay them for taking us in. "

Crusader: "I beat myself up all night for taking part in that disastrous
          operation. Then a monk told me that if I had time for remorse, I
          should spend it praying. He's right. It's my duty to pray for my
          departed men. The monk gave me this, but I think you should have
          it." [Obtain: Potion x 10] [2] "I will pray for all my lost
          comrades.

Monk: "The Crusaders deeply regret their actions. I believe it's time to put
      the past behind us and forgive them. Yevon shall forgive those who seek
      redemption. Should you need a place to recuperate, please return. You are
      always welcome here." [Obtain: Hi-Potion x 2] [2] "I believe the wounded

[By the Highroad gate, Mushroom Rock-side:]

Guado: "The warrior monks and the Guado have joined forces to guard the

       Seymour consider the people's safety above all." [2] "The Crusaders
       have done their duty. From now on, the warrior monks and the Guado will
       protect Spira."

              Guado are pretty brusque, but they make reliable comrades."

Warrior Monk: "We are securing the Highroad under Maester Kinoc's orders."

Man: "All this stuff here, the Crusaders left behind. They all ran away in a
     hurry." [2] "They caged a sinspawn in this! Damn fools.

Warrior Monk: "Those Al Bhed have no shame. They came all the way down here to
              make money. They have some nerve showin' up here. It's their
              fault the operation failed." [2] "Sooner or later, we warrior
              monks will crush the Al Bhed.

Man: "The road's finally open, so I'm planning on heading north. Actually,
     I'm a little scared about going. A lot of people died there." [2] "I'll
     bet the dead soldiers became fiends, and are creeping around."

Woman: "A bunch of wounded Crusaders passed by a moment ago. They were all
       hanging their heads, crestfallen. It was too painful to watch." [2]
       "Cruel punishment for defying the teachings... Too cruel, I'd say."

Man: "I thought about joining the Crusaders, but maybe I should join the
     warrior monks instead."

Man: "Just the other day the Crusaders marched through here. Sure is quiet
     now." [2] "I suppose only a summoner can defeat Sin. The teachings are
     right after all."

Warrior Monk: "Fiends stalk the area, but people just stroll through anyway.
              It doesn't make our job any easier." [2] "Don't stray off the
              road. Make our job a little easier."

Woman: "The warrior monks are real stiffs, really unapproachable. But I am
       grateful to them for guarding the Highroad."

Kid: "A warrior monk got mad at me. He said I can't play anymore, because
     there are fiends here." [2] "I heard so much noise during the operation.
     Was that the sound of machina?"

Guado: "Please rest assured. On Guado's honor, we will guard the Highroad."

Fat Man: "This is a statue of Lord Mi'ihen, who founded the Crusaders several
         hundred years ago. Lord Mi'ihen passed along this very road on his
         way to St. Bevelle. Ever since then, this road has been known as
         Mi'ihen Highroad." [2] "Lord Mi'ihen faithfully followed the
         teachings, unlike the Crusaders these days."

Man: "I hear the ferry's back in service."

Woman: "We should never forget the folly of Operation Mi'ihen. Such a tragedy
       must never happen again."

Man: "A quiet, beautiful day, eh?" [2] "I don't scare much anymore. Must be
     my age. If Sin happens to show up, so be it. I'll just pray as the
     teachings tell me, and go straight to the Farplane."

         feel like working anymore."] [3] ["I am fed up of working with
         morons."]

Warrior Monk: "We're keeping an eye on the Al Bhed so they don't take

Crusader: "I know what happened to his friend, but I...I just can't tell

Cameraman: "Stop bothering us! You've already proven your point at the

Man: "The Kilika Beasts went back home. I hope they win next year."

Woman: "Even if the Crusaders are wiped out, the warrior monks will protect

Nun: "The Crusaders defied the precepts and failed. They should disband for
     their own good."

Monk: "I shall remain in Luca for a while and spread the word of Yevon among

           monks better watch their step. What goes around comes around!"

Woman: "I think the fiend incident was the Al Bhed's doing. They're always up

           R1 (Yuna): "I'm ready."
              Belgimene: "That's the spirit! But before we begin... I have
                         healed your aeons. Well, shall we?"

           R2: "As you wish. A pity, though. I'm ready anytime, if you change
               your mind."

[The battle begins; Belgimene summons Ixion.]

Belgimene: "Call whichever aeon you want."

[After the first attacks have taken place:]

Belgimene: "Don't hold anything back! Show me what you've learned!"

[When Ixion uses Haste:]

Narrative: Note that this Ixion used "Haste." How is it that it may use magic
           that Yuna's Ixion cannot? Select Abilities in the Aeons menu to
           find a list of new abilities your aeons can learn. For example, if
           you teach Valefor the ability "Cure," it can heal as well as
           fight.

[If you lose the battle:]

Belgimene: "You have a lot to learn. Still wet behind the ears, but you have
           spirit. Here, your prize. Go on, take it." [Obtain: Smoke Bomb x 6,
           Summoner's Soul]

Narrative: Now that you have Summoner's Soul...you can spend items to teach
           your aeons new abilities. First select Abilities...then select an
           aeon. A list of available abilities appears. The item cost for each
           ability is also displayed at the top right of the screen. On the
           left is the amount of items currently in stock...and on the right,
           the amount of items remaining after the procedure. If an ability
           has already been learned...or you have insufficient items to teach
           an ability...that ability is displayed in gray and cannot be
           selected. When you select an ability you want your aeon to learn...
           you will be asked to confirm the procedure. Select "Yes" to teach
           the ability to your aeon. Aeons can learn most of the same abilities
           that the characters can. However, there are some abilities which
           aeons cannot learn. This concludes the abilities tutorial.

Belgimene: "Study, Yuna, and grow strong." [She leaves.]

[If you win the battle:]

Belgimene: "Stop. That is enough. You're good. You bested me fairly. Here,
           your prize. Go on, take it." [Obtain: Dragon Scale x 2, Summoner's
           Soul x 1]

[Same tutorial as above plays.]

Belgimene: "I look forward to meeting you again. Till next time, Yuna.

O'aka: "O'aka, at your service!" [Got any weapons?/Got any items?/Leave.]

Yuna: "Shoopufs! I haven't ridden one in so long!"
Tidus: "What? You've been on one of these?"
Yuna: "Well, just once. Ten years ago, with Kimahri. Remember?"
Kimahri: "Shoopuf shook, Yuna fall in water. Shoopuf scoop up Yuna with long
         nose. Yuna jump in three more times for fun. Kimahri worried."
Yuna: "Whoops!"
Kimahri: "Yuna had fun. Kimahri happy."

Yuna [2]: "I lived in the city of Bevelle until ten years ago. I moved to
          Besaid after my father defeated Sin. Kimahri was with me the whole
          way!"
Tidus: "Bevelle?"
Yuna: "It's the biggest city in Spira! The main temple of Yevon is there."

Yuna [3]: "Come on! Let's get on the shoopuf!"

Kimahri: "Biran is troublemaker, but Ronso do not lie. Summoners
         disappearing -- that was not lie."
Tidus: "Right, I'll be careful."

Kimahri [2]: "Smells like oil."

Auron: "Ten years ago..."
Tidus: "A history lesson?"
Auron: "Jecht saw his first shoopuf here. Surprised, he drew his blade and
       struck it."
Tidus: "Why?"
Auron: "He was drunk... Thought it was a fiend."
Tidus: "Oh, brother..."
Auron: "We offered all the money we had as an apology. Jecht never drank again.
       But, it would seem that shoopuf still works here."

Auron [2]: "Even after ten years, Spira hasn't changed." [3] "Truly... The
           place seems to resist change. It would take something unusual."
           [3] "Don't let the peaceful scenery fool you. Be on guard at all
           times.

Woman: "Riding the shoopuf is free because the temple pays for it." [2] "The
       temple provides for people. We are truly blessed.

Woman: "Need anything?" [Got any armor?/Got any items?/Leave.]
Woman: "feel free to stop by anytime."

Fat Man: "Hey, there. If you don't buy anything from me, you'll regret it."
         [Got any armor?/Got any items?/Leave.]
Fat Man: "Thanks!"

Warrior Monk: "There have been reports of Al Bhed sightings in this area.
              Stay alert and keep your guard up at all times!" [2] "The Al
              Bhed have green eyes with a swirl pattern. Report any sightings
              immediately!"

Man: "They say our machina violate the teachings, eh? Nonsense!" [2] "These
     machina have Yevon's approval. Don't mix them up with the forbidden ones,
     got it?"

Hypello: "Dangerous when shoopuf's close. Wants to be shmooshed?" [2] "Don't
         touch shoopuf. Tailss will be shlapping!"

Man: "There's a long wait to ride the shoopuf since space is limited. But
     summoners get priority since they need to get on their way to Zanarkand."
     [2] "Careful where you shop. This area is full of cunning merchants.

Wakka: "Let the driver know when you're ready."

Woman: "I was going to return to Bevelle after the tournament in Luca...but
       the Crusaders blocked the roads and I couldn't get through." [2] "My
       plans are ruined. Now what am I supposed to do?"

Merchant: "Welcome! You seem to have find taste, sir! Listen, buy from me
          and you won't have problems down the line." [Got any weapons?/Got
          any items?/Leave.]
Merchant: "Thanks!"

Woman: "Well, hello there! Are you in luck today! If you buy something now,
       I'll give you a big discount! Well, what do you say?" [Got any
       weapons?/Got any items?/Leave.]
Woman: "Aww, leaving already? Well, come back again, you hear?"

Lulu: "Riding a shoopuf isn't THAT much fun.
Wakka: "How little you know! Some things little boys never grow out of!"
Wakka & Tidus: "Right?"

Lulu [2]: "The merchants here are wily. Pick your shop well."

-----

[The Chocobo Knights are talking with a shoopuf driver.]
Driver: "Noo, I don shink sho. Ish bad idea, yesh."
Lucil: "Please, we beg of you!"
Driver: "Imposhibibble! Imposhibibble!"
Tidus: "What's wrong?
Elma: "This guy won't let our chocobo on the shoopuf!"
Tidus: "It is kinda big."
Elma: "It's just not fair!"
Clasko: "He does have a point, though."
Elma: "So, what? We just leave him behind?"
Clasko: "Hey, I didn't say that. Just..."
Lucil: "It is no good. We will have to find another way. We will find a ford
       where we can cross on foot."
Elma: "Yes, Captain, sir!"
Clasko: "But...that'll take days!"
Lucil: "Where there's a will, there's a way."
Clasko: "Oh, boy..."
Elma: "That's our captain!"
[The Knights run off.]
T-Narrative: Where there's a will, there's a way. Those words stayed with me.
             I wonder how Captain Lucil is doing.

Maechen: "Would you like to hear a bit about the wondrous shoopuf?"
         R1 --> No stories, please!"
         R2 --> Absolutely!

         R1: "Pity."
         R2: "There are many things we do not know about the shoopuf. For
             example, what does it eat? It eats nothing! The water it sucks
             through its shnoz somehow supports its considerable size. Some
             theorize it eats teeny-weeny waterborne organisms. And that, as
             they say, is that."

Maechen [2]: "Perhaps you'd like to hear about the Hypello, hmm?"
             R1 --> No stories, please!
             R2 --> Absolutely!

             R1: "Pity."
             R2: "The shoopuf handlers belong to a race of water-dwellers known
                 as the Hypello. They may be slow on land, but in the water
                 they're quick as silvery fish! You'd think they'd make
                 admirable players of blitzball. But their lackadaisical dis-
                 -position draws them to less strenuous pastimes. And that, as
                 they say, is that."

Maechen [3]: "I believe I've said all there is to say."

Woman: "So that's Lady Yuna? Hmmm... No wonder." [2] "I can see why the Al Bhed
       would go after someone like Lady Yuna."

Kimahri: "Kimahri fail as guardian on shoopuf. Kimahri never fail again."

Wakka: "Might be more Al Bhed! Keep watch, ya?"

Auron: "Guard Yuna."

Old Man: "Sin took my daughter, but I just saw her again for the first time
         in five years. That Guadosalam place was amazing." [2] "I've seen
         my daughter, so I have no regrets. I'm ready for the Farplane
         anytime now."

Lulu: "Looks like we're stuck here for a while."

Warrior Monk: "Seems you destroyed the Al Bhed's machina. That's some
              dedication. You'll receive a blessing from Yevon. It'll be
              necessary to strengthen security so that the Al Bhed won't get
              their way anymore." [2] "The Al Bhed hide their green eyes with
              goggles. They're known to resort to petty tricks like that."

Hypello: "Shoopuf shleeping. Wait until shoopuf wake up?"

Woman: "I thought I was lucky not to run into any wily merchants on this side
       of the shore. But I ended up buying something from that man over there."
       [2] "His goods are cheaper than the other merchants', but he seems kind
       of suspicious."

O'aka: "O'aka, at your service!" [Whatcha got?/Leave.]

Guado: "I sense that Lady Yuna was here. I can feel the warmth of the people.
       The descendant of a high summoner and loved by everyone... Yuna embodies
       perfection." [2] "This is the situation at hand. You'll shall understand
       soon."

Miyu: "Should I stay a Crusader, or follow a different path? I wanted to
      discuss this with someone on the Farplane, but maybe I shouldn't..."
      [2] "It's my future, so I need to make my own decisions."

Guado: "Guadosalam is up ahead, but the path is infested with fiends. Make
       all necessary preparations before departing." [2] "It is my duty to
       ensure the safety of visitors to Guadosalam."

[Around Yuna, the crowd is saying things, like:]

-"Lord Braska must be bursting with pride up on the Farplane for having such a
 fine daughter!"
-"How about seeing Lord Braska in Guadosalam?"
-"I hope to celebrate Lady Yuna's Calm while I'm still alive."
-"With a summoner like you at our side, we've no need to fear Sin!"
-"I heard the Al Bhed attacked you! Are you okay?"

[The crowd disperses after Rikku joins the party:]

Woman: "I'm afraid I'll be attacked by Al Bhed if I travel alone."

Old Woman: "I'll have great stories to tell about meeting Lady Yuna."

Old Man: "I tell you, my wife was as pretty as Lady Yuna back in her day."

Man: "Have you seen the Crusaders returning home? They look pathetic. And they
     were so confident the last time they passed through."

Old Woman: "You know that machina that lifts you up to the shoopuf? I don't
           like it, I tell you. I don't care if it's been approved by the
           temple. Machina is machina. That's that."

Guado: "Present yourself to Lord Seymour before approaching the

Guado Woman: "Humans! Humans! A summoner and her guardians!" [2] "Wait,

Auda Guado: "Since embracing Yevon, we Guado have learned the joy that
            is blitzball." [2] "I hope the people of Spira will find
            peace through blitzball."

Guado Woman: "I suppose you think we look...odd, don't you? That's fine.
             We guado are used to that sort of thing." [2] "But if you
             ask me, you humans look absolutely disgusting. Still, what
             does it matter? Such nonsense is beneath us, no?" [3] "Once
             a human child simply looked at me and then burst into tears.
             That hurt.

Giera Guado: "We Guado protect the Farplane so the dead can rest in peace."

Guado: "Although we Guado differ from humans in appearance, our respect for
       the dead is the same." [2] "People come to Guadosalam from every
       corner of Spira to see their loved ones again."

Yuma Guado: "The elders just won't give up the old tongue. I keep telling
            them how unseemly it is, babbling like that to guests." [2]
            "It's just what old folks do, I guess. Please, take no offense."

Guado Woman: "Lord Seymour instructs the Guado youth on numerous subjects.
             Thanks to him, I learned about Yevon's teachings and the history
             of Spira." [2] "Lord Seymour is a great teacher. He explains
             everything quite clearly."

Old G Woman: "Good traveller, prithee forgive us our antiquated prattling."
             [2] "Once, all Guado spoke the old tongue. But when Lord Jyscal
             brought us to the light from Yevon...the old tongue fell out of
             favour with many, and suffers now a slow demise." [3] "The youth
             laugh upon us as stale old relics who live too much in the past."

Old Guado: "Thou seem'st weary, good traveller. Wouldst sit and rest they feet
           awhile? Ah, belike my speech perplexes thee? 'Tis old Guado I speak,
           a tongue seldom heard within even Guadosalam now." [2] "A dying
           breed we are, speakers of the old tongue. I fear this precious
           legacy hath but little time remaining." [3] "Many Guado shun the old
           tongue, favouring instead the speech of foreign tribes. 'Tis a pity,

Zazi Guado: "I'd love to step away from the Guado Glories and play for a
            different team once in a while. Why, if they paid me enough,
            I'd even play for the Al Bhed!"

Pah Guado: "Say, you play for the Besaid Aurochs. You're Tidus, right? I
           saw you at the tournament. Let's blitz sometime. Those fiends
           really made a mess. Some of my teammates were badly hurt."

Guado: "As sole protectors of the Farplane, the Guado are the supreme race
       of Spira. We are fundamentally different from the populous humans
       and the hulking Ronso. But, that's an old story. Now the Guado seek
       harmony with other races." [2] "Let us welcome human and Ronso
       without prejudice."

Guado Woman: "You find it difficult telling us Guado apart, don't you? I

Guado Woman: "Thank you so much for destroying that Al Bhed contraption.

         R3 --> Tell me about the pyreflies.

         R1: "Pity. Suit yourself."

         R2: "Ahem! The Farplane's the place where pyreflies born from a
             sending gather. They appear in the shape of people who've died
             and gone to the Farplane. Quite the phenomenon; how I wish I
             understood it more fully! The Al Bhed have a theory, you know.
             They say the pyreflies are just reacting to the visitors' thoughts
             and dreams. But only the dead appear on the Farplane. No image of
             the living has ever been seen. It's a great mystery! But maybe...
             Maybe the dead leave a bit of themselves in the hearts of the
             living. And that little bit borrows the pyreflies' power for their
             paranormal performance! Or maybe not. Who knows?" And that, as
             they say, is that."

         R3: "Ahem! They may be called 'pyreflies,' but they aren't really
             'flies,' you see. They're those lights you see whenever a fiend
             dies. The little fellows are responsible for a few fantastic
             phenomena. Visions of the past, spheres, fiends -- these are all
             the pyreflies' doing. In fact...pyreflies have something in common
             with aeons, too. The dreams of the fayth reach through the spirit
             of the summoner... And that which becomes unreal becomes real for
             all to see! Or maybe not. Who knows? And that, as they say, is
             that."

       Seymour's private chambers. You may not enter."

Kimahri: "Kimahri not like Maester Seymour"
Yuna: "Aa! Shhh!"

Kimahri [2]: "Kimahri speak no more."

Lulu: "These are the past leaders of the Guado."
Tidus: "They all look the same!"
Wakka: "Maester Seymour doesn't look like them, though."
Lulu: "Don't you know? The last leader... Maester Jyscal wed a human woman.
      She was Seymour's mother.

Lulu [2]: "The last leader... Maester Jyscal wed a human woman. She was
          Seymour's mother."

Yuna: "Why does he want to see me?"

[When Tromell comes out and the rest of the party walks in:]

Tromell: "This way, please!"

[After being let into the dining hall:]

Auron: "Stay on your guard."
Tidus: "Why? This guy's just a priest, right?"
Auron: "Those with power use that power. Maesters have power."
Tidus: "Wait... You sure you don't have something against Yevon?"
[Auron chuckles.]
Auron: "I lived a long time in Zanarkand."

Auron [2]: "What is taking them so long?"

Wakka: "I get the feeling he called us up here for more than just dinner." [2]
       "Nothing 'gainst the maester, but I hope we get this over with quick."

Lulu: "There's no temple here in Guadosalam, see? Summoners usually just pass
      through on their way elsewhere."
[Tidus laughs.]
Lulu: "What?"
Tidus: "I didn't even ask a question and you're explaining things."
Lulu: "You rather I say nothing, then?"
Tidus: "No, no! Maybe you finally believe I don't know anything about Spira.
       And maybe that means you believe me about Zanarkand, too?"
Lulu: "Well... There are many things I do not know. Your Zanarkand is one of
      those things. I suppose I can't say what I think either way. Still, be
      careful. You shouldn't tell other people."
Tidus: "Yeah, I know."

Lulu [2]: "Why don't you eat something?"

Kimahri: "Kimahri speak no more."

Rikku: "Mmmm! This is good!" [2] "Guado sure know how to eat!" [3] "Gee, I
       wonder what all this is for. It's exciting!"

Yuna: "What could it be?" [2] "I haven't done anything to make him mad."

[After Seymour's proposal (double entendre!):]

Creepy Guado: "Remember, the Farplane is sacrosanct. Proper conduct, please."

       hold it against me. I gave up the game. I'm a guardian from here on,
       you know? This guy -- looks a lot like you -- showed up. Travelling
       with him, I thought, maybe...you were still alive somewhere, ya? But,
       then again, here you are on the Farplane. Guess your place is here. So,
       how you been? Oh, that guy I just told you 'bout. I gave him your sword.
       He likes it.

Wakka [2]: "Just a sec more."

[Lulu is watching Chappu and Wakka.]
Lulu: "He is dead, and I am still alive. Coming here really makes that clear.
      I should focus more on what I have to do now."
Tidus: "What?"
Lulu: "I'm not even sure what I'm saying."
Tidus: "Don't you mean that you should leave Chappu behind? I'm sure he was a
       great guy, but there'll be others."
Lulu: "Hmm... That's a possibility."
Tidus: "How about...Wakka?"
Lulu: "What, me? With Wakka?"
Tidus: "Yeah, you two get along great!"
Lulu: "Getting along isn't enough. Not even close."
Tidus: "Oh, sorry. My mistake."
Lulu: "You'd do well to remember that. Knowing a bit about women might come in
      handy some day."
Tidus: "Yeah, I'll remember."
Lulu: "I won't be forgetting either. Goodbye, Chappu. You always said I looked
      grumpy. But those were the happiest days of my life."

Lulu [2]: "Why don't you try calling someone? All you have to do is think
          about them."

NOTE: Dialogue is said after visiting the Farplane.

Creepy Guado: "Please refrain from speaking of Lord Jyscal. We must avoid
              unseemly rumors for the sake of Spira's harmony." [2] "Please,
              leave the matter of Lord Jyscal to us Guado."

Guado Woman: "Is Lord Seymour really going to marry? Aww..." [2] "One of my
             friends patrols the roads. If you meet him, please say hello
             for me!"

Auron: "We leave as soon as Yuna returns. I trust you'll be ready."

Wakka: "For awhile there, I was a little worried about what was gonna
       happen, ya?

Kimahri: "Guado potions good. Buy some before leaving.

Lulu: "Listen. If Yuna gets married, then I..."
Tidus: "What? That again?"
Lulu: "Yes. If she is to marry, I would want her to marry for love."
Tidus: "See?"
Lulu: "But... If Yuna said she wanted to marry the one she loves, I would
      have to object."
Tidus: "Huh? Uh... You're not making much sense."
Lulu: "I know."

---

Tidus: "Lulu..."
Lulu: "I've talked enough about that."
Tidus: "What?"
Lulu: "I'm sorry, just forget about it."
Tidus: "Geez! Grumpy!"
Lulu: "You'll understand one of these days. I just don't want to give it
      words. Not yet. I shouldn't have to say this, but don't fall in
      love with her."
      R1 --> Okay.
      R2 --> Too late.
      R3 --> You're more my type, Lulu.

      R1: "That's fine, then."
      R2: "I see. But... You must keep your feelings inside, until the
          pilgrimage is over."
      R3: "Interesting. I suppose I could add you to my list. I wish you good
          luck, little boy. You're going to need it."

Lulu [3]: "I'm a little worried about Lord Jyscal. I wonder if Maester Seymour
          has heard." [4] "Leave the Guado's problems to the Guado...they say."

[If you saw the scene with Rikku instead of the one with Lulu, you can talk to
her as well.]

Rikku: "Say, you ever think about gettin' married?"
Tidus: "Me? No, never."
Rikku: "I think about it a lot."
Tidus: "Aren't you a little young?"
Rikku: "Some people marry really young in Spira, you know."
Tidus: "You mean people our age get married?"
Rikku: "Fiends are around, and there's always Sin, right? One of them might
       get you, you know? Lots of people marry the first person they fall in
       love with, just like that!"
Tidus: "Really?"
Rikku: "I'll probably be the same way."

---

Rikku: "You an only child?"
Tidus: "Yeah."
Rikku: "I got an older brother, myself."
Tidus: "Huh?"
Rikku: "I wish I had some younger brothers and sisters, though..."
Tidus: "So ask your parents."
Rikku: Mom died... A machina went on a rampage..."
Tidus: "I'm sorry."
Rikku: "When I get married, I'm gonna have lots of kids! That way they'll
       all have brothers and sisters! What?"
Tidus: "You're talking about your future, aren't you? That's great."
Rikku: "It's pretty normal, I think. Hey, maybe Yuna's back!"

[3] Rikku: "When we leave here, we have to go through the Thunder Plains next,
           you know."

Man: "Thanks to the summoner's sending the fallen ones to the Farplane...we
     were able to reunite with our son, who was killed in battle. Words cannot
     express how grateful we are." [2] "The summoner's sending has saved our
     son from becoming a fiend."

Woman: "Our son was killed in Operation Mi'ihen. We begged him not to go,
       but..." [2] "Never did I imagine our son would part before our time."

Guado Woman: "My mother passed away a long time ago. But I can always visit
             the Farplane whenever I need her." [2] "I think it's wonderful
             that we can see the dead whenever we want, don't you?"

Guado: "Lord Jyscal, back from the Farplane? Hahaha, you must be joking! He
       passed away in peace, leaving the leadership to Seymour Guado. He would
       never come back to haunt us." [2] "Leave the Farplane to the Guado. Do
       not meddle in affairs you know nothing of."

Guado Woman: "Everyone is talking about Lady Yuna -- how she's the daughter

             Operation Mi'ihen, right?" [2] "If Lady Yuna marries into the
             Guado tribe, we will all welcome her warmly.

[After finding Shelinda by the Thunder Plains entrance:]

     like you! Her name's 'Yuna.' Boy was I surprised the first time I saw her!
     Ah, 'course she's not as good as you. If you were still alive, I bet you'd

       Please head towards Macalania Temple. Lord Seymour awaits!" [2] "Please

Guado: "Lady Yuna's visits are always beneficial to the Guado." [2] "Those who

     been so long since we've had some good news! This is all so exciting!"

Old Man: "When Lady Yuna gets married, will she abandon her quest to vanquish

Old Woman: "Never even crossed my mind that Lady Yuna would marry... Now
           that's a great story to tell!"

          Crusaders had defeated Sin... That would've been perfect." [2] "By
          the time we get home, they'll be celebrating their marriage."

Man: "The merchants are ecstatic about the maester's marriage plans. They're

Old Man: "The maester's engagement is such a blessing. It lightens even my

           R1: Long ago, fiends known as Qactuars roamed the Djose Continent
               freely. They ran rampant, ravaging fields and tormenting
               travellers. Then Lord Gandof appeared -- a man later to become
               high summoner. He scoured the continent for the Qactuars and
               drove them to these plains. Once he'd gathered the Qactuars
               together, Lord Gandof linked the sign of ([]), whereupon the
               Qactuars turned to smoke and were absorbed by a stone. The
               Qactuars were thus sealed into stone, fated to face lightning
               day and night. Unless someone again links the ([]) sign and
               releases the seal, they shall suffer within the stone for their
               deeds. Thus did Lord Gandof bring relief to peoples all over
               Spira. He believed that the battle with Sin was only one great
               part of a summoner's greater mission.

Guado: "Maester Seymour awaits. Please hurry to Macalania Temple." [2] "I
       leave Lady Yuna in your hands until you are through these woods."

[If you try to go to the right path (you need to go left to reach M. Temple):]

Lucil: "Lady Yuna, it is good to see you made it through safely. And, if I may,
       congratulations on your betrothal."
Elma: "Maester Seymour's people are expecting you."
Lucil: "Take that road to go to Macalania Temple.

Lucil: "We've received several reports of summoners disappearing these last
       few days. Please be careful, my lady." [2] "When our assignment here is
       done, we will be heading north. Hopefully we'll catch some chocobos and
       rebuild our unit." [3] "But I must say...it's been a while. Maybe too
       long since we've had anything to celebrate."

Elma: "We're on watch duty at the temple at least until the wedding's done.
      Anyone tries to crash our party, we'll send 'em packing!" [2] "Oh, yeah,
      Clasko's back there with the chocobo. Stop and say hi if you've got the
      time." [3] "Next time you see us, we'll be the proud Chocobo Knights once
      again!"

[If you try to go down the road behind Lucil and Elma, one of 'em'll say:]

Lucil: "This road leads to Bevelle. You should hurry to the temple in
       Macalania.

       -then-

Elma: "This isn't the way to the temple! Weren't you listening to Captain
      Lucil?

Tidus: "How'd you know what it wanted?"
Clasko: "I've always been able to tell how chocobos feel. Maybe I'd make a

       somethin' from me?"

Auron: "Anything can happen."

Saxmouse: "Such a fine day to celebrate! The monks should let loose today!"
          [2] "Live it up, everyone! Have a blast and make everyone happy!"

Harpbird: "With rank set aside like this, I believe everyone is behaving a
          little too wildly." [2] "Strip away the exterior, and the devout
          monk is just another man, it seems."

Man: "I thought I heard a scream! I know we're celebrating Maester Seymour's
     marriage, but it mustn't get out of hand. These are the leftovers from
     the banquet. Go ahead, take 'em with you, lad." [Obtain: Ether]

Li'l Nun: "Maester Seymour always smells so nice! Isn't he grand?"

Monk: "I can't believe Seymour's getting married. It's certainly something
      to celebrate! Please give this congratulatory gift to Lady Yuna."
      [Obtain: Elixir]

Man: "Hic! Eh...I've been protecting Maester Seymour since he was a wee lad.
     Ask me anything ye want to know 'bout Maester Seymour."
     R1 --> Seymour as a young child.
     R2 --> Seymour as a young man.
     R3 --> Seymour as a monk.
     R4 --> Seymour as a summoner.
     R5 --> Don't care to know."

     R1: "Both Guado and human blood flow through Maester Seymour's veins. This
         mixed heritage caused him a deal of grief in his childhood. But
         because of that very experience...he grew to become a great leader who
         aspired to bring Guado and humans together in friendship."

     R2: "Lord Braska vanquished Sin when Lord Seymour was about your age.
         During the celebration of the Calm's arrival, Maester Mika ordained
         Lord Jyscal a maester of Yevon. He praised Lord Jyscal's achievements,
         including the conversion of the Guado to the teachings of Yevon.
         Maester Seymour was still a young lad then, but he tried hard to
         assist Lord Jyscal."

     R3: "As a monk, Maester Seymour soon distinguished himself. His
         accomplishments were many and acclaimed by all. He shot up through the
         ranks quickly, he did. Aye, he rose on his own, never riding Lord
         Jyscal's coattails. He's truly a remarkable young man."

     R4: "As a summoner, Maester Seymour's strength is matchless. Yet, he
         became a maester of Yevon instead of undertaking the pilgrimage to
         battle Sin. I think he believes that there's more to a summoner's duty
         than just destroying Sin."

     R5: "Don't you hold back now."

Auron: "Jecht used to sing this song..."
Tidus: "Yeah, over and over. But not this good, that's for sure."
Auron: "Another trait you share."
Tidus: "What, were you listening?"
[Flashback to Zanarkand. Tidus hymns the faith on a dock. Auron listens.]
Tidus: "Eesh... Can't I get a little privacy?"
Auron: "Your singing reminded me of Spira."
Tidus: "Oh, right. You're not originally from Zanarkand, are you? You
       homesick?"
Auron: "Maybe."
[The flashback ends.]
Tidus: "Say, how'd you get to Zanarkand, anyway? Sin?"
[Auron doesn't reply.]
Tidus: "Uh-huh, I thought so."
T-Narrative: That proved it. Sin was the link between Zanarkand and Spira.
             Which means, if we kill Sin, I'll never be able to go home.

Auron [2]: "We should get moving soon."

[On first free-movement:]

Wakka: "Why didn't I just shut my big mouth?"

Lulu: "This is tough on all of us."

Auron: "The price for protecting summoners."

Tidus: "Did you ever find anything out about Yuna?"
Cid: "I'm lookin' into it, okay? Don't worry. I'm using a sphere
     oscillo-finder. If she's out there, we'll get her."
Tidus: "A sphere oscillo-finder?"
Cid: "It's an ancient machina. I don't know how it works either,
     so don't ask me, okay?"
Lulu: "And you still use it?"
Cid: "I don't even rightly know how this rig flies, either! All
     because of the Yevon taboo on machina, we're running around
     in the dark here! Ain't it a rush, kiddos?"

Cid [2]: "Careful what you touch! Ship's not as stable as she looks!"

Brother: "Mayja sa pa! E's luhlahdnydehk!" [2] "Vmoehk ec naymmo hud so
         vunda!" [3] "Gaab vmoehk! Gaab vmoehk!" ["Leave me be! I'm
         concentrating!"] [2] ["Flying is really not my forte!"] [3]
         ["Keep flying! Keep flying!"

[After Cid tells you he doesn't know how the airship really flies:]

Wakka: "I can't believe we're flying through the skie in this! A machina!"

Lulu: "We're powerless as long as we're on this ship."

Rikku: "Remember this ship? It's the one we found under the sea!"

Auron: "Whether Yuna's safe or not, there's trouble brewing."

[After Cid/Auron scene:]

Auron: "Let him say what he wants."

Wakka: "He called Yuna his, uh, niece, right? I mean, so that makes her
       Al Bhed, right? Don't say it! Yuna's Yuna, right?" [2] "Yuna's Yuna,
       right?"

Rikku: "Lyh'd Yunie aht ran bemknesyka?" ["Can't Yunie end her pilgrimage?"]

Yuna: "No matter what happens, Yuna won't give up her pilgrimage."

Cid: "First, we rescue Yuna! Let's show 'em what we got!"

Lulu: "No matter what happens, Yuna won't give up her pilgrimage."

Isaaru: "We owe our lives to the Al Bhed. However, no matter how much they beg,
        we cannot quit our pilgrimage."
Tidus: "Even though you'll die?"
Issaru: "I've known since I was a child. My will is set. If I do not do it,
        someone else must, you understand."

Isaaru [2]: "I'm amazed this thing can fly, truly! It must be sacrilege to
            think so highly of a machina. I feel uneasy just riding it!"
Tidus: "Sure it's not motion sickness?"
Isaaru: "Motion sickness? What infirmity is that?"

Isaaru [3]: "As soon as we land, we continue the pilgrimage!

Maroda: "Hey, I'm not looking forward to my brother dying when this is all
        over. If only there was some way of doing it without anyone dying."
Tidus: "Let's think of one!"
Maroda: "Easier said than done. If we had all the time in the world, yeah, we'd
        think of something. And while we were thinking, Sin would kill us all.
        Spira doesn't have that time."

Maroda [2]: "The Al Bhed caught up to us in Besaid. They grabbed Pacce, so we
            had to do what they said. We needed a break, anyway. Pacce was
            pretty tired. He should never have come on the pilgrimage, little
            kid like that. Still, he does pretty good for his size. He's gonna
            be something someday."

      R1: "Unusual. Most people would never forgive a summoner who quit."

     that attacked Home found her." [2] "Hah! Wedding, my britches! Now while
     I'm around! Those Yevon rockheads! I'll give 'em something to remember!"

Rikku: "What's Seymour doing alive? Didn't we take care of him in Macalania?"
Auron: "He is dead. As dead as Jyscal was. His attachment to this world kept
       him from the next."
Rikku: "Whoa, scary!

Auron [2]: "Yuna must be trying to send him."
Rikku: "Wonder if that will work."
Auron: "Perhaps he won't expect it."

Auron [3]: "Bevelle... It's been ten years."

Rikku: "Yeah! We're gonna save Yunie, and nobody's gonna stop us!"

Wakka: "I'm glad Yuna's okay and all, but what's with those fancy clothes?"
Lulu: "It's called a wedding dress."
Wakka: "What!?"

Wakka [2]: "Grrr... What's going on?"

Lulu: "The city of Bevelle is built on the water. There may be underwater
      fighting. You or Rikku should study your magic, just in case." [2]

Warrior Monk: "You can't enter Bevelle now. The guard is on full alert, you
              know. So just go back to where you came from, got it?" [2] "You
              commoners should stay quiet and obey the temple. Mind your mouth

Woman: "It's easier to get to Macalania Temple now that this road's open
       again." [2] "I used to be able to pass through this way when I was a
       child, but then a big tree blocked off the road. I'm glad someone cut
       it down!" [3] "I'm just taking a break now. Even with a shortcut, it can
       get tiring, you know?"

[At the campsite, after speaking with woman and her kid:]

     R2 --> Hope you find 'em.

     R1: "What? Really? Thanks, kid!"
     R2: "I wonder if they got the place mixed up. They're so careless
         sometimes."

[Back at the entrance to the woods from Thunder Plains:]

Man: "I was reunited with my wife thanks to all of you." [2] "But now my
     boy's missing. He went into the woods alone." [3] "I guess he went

     do."

Woman: "I finally met up with my husband, thanks to your help. I can't
       thank you enough." [2] "But my son went off into the woods before
       my husband came." [3] "I...I don't know what to do."

[Tidus can find the kid up on the starlight path.]

Kid: "It feels like there's something around here, doesn't it? Yeah,

       time to be picking fights with the Guado, that's for sure."

Chocobo Rider: "Lost? Follow me if you want to go back to Bevelle."
               [2] "Look, these plains go on forever. Take it easy or
               you'll die out here!" [3] "Smart travellers like me ride
               chocobos to avoid fiends!"

Maechen: "Perhaps you would like to know a bit about these plains?"
         R1 --> Maybe next time.
         R2 --> Do tell!

         R1: "What a pity."
         R2: "As you know, these plains were once a battlefield. A great battle
             between Bevelle and Zanarkand, a melee of machina! That war left
             this place a barren, lifeless land. Then, time passed. The
             summoners took note of this uninhabited land. Great battles could
             be fought here, with no harm to the common folk. Perfect for the
             final battle with Sin, as it were. Summoners wait here, ready to
             perform the Final Summoning. Ah, to know what they must feel! In
             any case, when Sin is defeated here, the Calm will visit Spira
             once more. That's why this place is now known as the Calm Lands.
             Exactly who dubbed it so is unknown. And that, as they say, is
             that."

Maechen [2]: "Oh dear, I almost forgot to tell you something. There's a chasm,
             a great rend in the earth, in these parts. A scar from High
             Summoner Gandof's bitter battle with Sin, four hundred years
             past."

Maechen [3]: "Like to hear about this place once more?"
             R1 --> Maybe next time.
             R2 --> Do tell!

             R1: [Same as R1 above.]
             R2: [Same as R2 above.]

[A fan-powered vehicle appears when you first come into the Calm Lands.]

Man: "Rin's Travelling Agency, at your service! We offer fine services at
     reasonable prices. Please consider making a purchase before crossing
     these vast plains." [Got any weapons?/Got any items?/Leave.]
Man: "Have a safe and pleasant crossing."

Chocobo Rider: "I hope you're not planning to cross this plain on foot."
               R1 --> I want to ride a chocobo!
               R2 --> Walking's not that bad.

               R1: "Well, these plains are home to lots of wild chocobos.
                   First we must train them to be dependable mounts. I'm
                   training some chocobos now, but they're not quite tame
                   yet. I'm sorry I can't lend you any. Walking might be
                   faster than waiting for one of my chocobos."
                   R3 --> Let me train one!
                   R4 --> Thanks anyway.

               R2: "I suppose you're right. Fighting fiends lets you polish
                   your skills."

               R3: "That's easier said than done. It's not that simple,
                   you know. You're sure you want to try?"
                   R5 --> Of course!
                   R6 --> Maybe not.

               R4: "Bye, now. Maybe next time I'll have a chocobo ready
                   for you."

               R5: "All right. Come with me."
                   [She takes him somewhere in the field.]
                   Trainer: "It's simple. Just get from where you are to where
                            I am before time runs out. Since you're riding a
                            wild chocobo, it'll just run whatever way it feels
                            like. Press (D-left) and (D-right) to steer it
                            between my chocobo and me. Keep and eye on the
                            clock and try not to miss the finish line. Don't
                            hesitate to ask me about chocobos if you need
                            help, okay? Let's begin, shall we? We'll shoot
                            for 0:12:8. Ready?"
                            R7 --> As ready as ever.
                            R8 --> Get me off this bird!
                            R9 --> Show me the controls.

               R6: [Same as R4]
               R7: [Chocobo mini-game starts.]
               R8: "You really want to quit?"
                   R10 --> Keep going.
                   R11 --> Really quit.
               R9: [Controls]

                   -The chocobo runs automatically.

[A woman guards a small path by the cliffside.]

Woman: "Even if I don't know what I'm watching for, duty's duty. I'm not
       moving. Well, unless something really unique happens, that is."

[If you try to run past her:]

Woman: "Hey, hey! You can't go down there!"

[A cutscene plays if you talk to a lone person by the Calm Lands' deep 'rend'.]

Svanda: "This gorge is called the Scar. They say that when the high summoner
        cornered Sin, Sin tore the earth here asunder with the last of its
        strength. The high summoner and Sin struck each other down at the
        gorge's bottom. Lord Gandof's sacrifice brought us the Calm."

Svanda: This gorge is called the Scar. They say that when the high summoner
        cornered Sin, Sin tore the earth here asunder with the last of its
        strength. [2] The high summoner and Sin struck each other down at the
        gorge's bottom. Lord Gandof's sacrifice brought us the Calm." [3] "In
        the Calm Lands, we bury our dead in this gorge. We cannot send them
        because few summoners ever make it this far." [4] "I've heard that the
        dead that don't receive a proper burial roam the bottom of the gorge
        as fiends.

[By Svanda is a large rock spire in the earth. Upon inspection:]

Narrative: There is something written here.

           Fedr dra jyma yd ouin pylg ku vundo-heha, drah cajah du dra nekrd
           eh dra dniacd meha. [[With the vale at your back go forty-nine,
           then seven to the right in the truest line.]]

[Another rock spire by the travel agency:]

Narrative: Made of clay hardened by intense heat, it must be hundreds of years
           old.

[Belgimene is by the travel agency's rock spire.]

Belgimene: "Oh, you again. You're quite the notorious traitor these days."
Tidus: "What's it to you?"
Belgimene: "Ah, you shouldn't take what the maesters say too seriously. For
           summoners, destroying Sin is everything. We are no tools of Yevon,
           understand?"
Yuna: "Yes."
Belgimene: "So, are you up to the task?"
Yuna: "I do not know, but I will do my best."
Belgimene: "You've got spirit, but you'll need more to beat Sin. An aeon duel!
           Show me what you're made of."
           R1 --> Fight.
           R2 --> Pass.

           R1: "Excellent. But before we begin... I've just healed your aeons
               for you. Let us begin!"

               [Belgimene summons Shiva.]

               Belgimene: "Choose your aeon well, summoner."

               Narrative: Select Attributes in the Aeons menu to raise the
                          attributes of your aeons. Use this to compensate
                          for aeons' weaknesses by raising the physically
                          weak Shiva's HP, or increasing the usually slow
                          Bahamut's agility.

               [If you win:]

               Belgimene: "Stop. That is enough."

                          ---

               Belgimene: "Impressive. Remarkable talent. Traitor or no, you
                          may have what it takes to beat Sin. Take this. You
                          have earned it." [Obtain: Power Sphere x 30, Aeon's
                          Soul]
               Yuna: "Thank you."
               Belgimene: "I think you will do just fine. But, if you ever
                          feel like you want more training, seek the hidden
                          temple of Remiem. I will be waiting there.
                          Farewell."

               Narrative: Now that you have the Aeon's Soul...you can raise
                          your aeons' attributes. First select Attributes...
                          then select an aeon. The selected aeon's attributes
                          are displayed. Attributes that cannot be raised are
                          shown in gray. The current power of each attribute
                          is shown to the right. In this example, Ixion's
                          strength is 20. When you choose an attribute to
                          raise, the item cost for the procedure is displayed
                          at the top right of the screen. The item cost
                          differs depending on that aeon's current attributes.
                          The item cost for raising attributes is proportional
                          to each attributes' value. The higher the attribute,
                          the more items needed to raise it. Once you have
                          selected an attribute to raise...you will be asked
                          to confirm the procedure. Select "Yes" to raise the
                          select attribute. This concludes the attributes
                          tutorial.

               [If you lose:]

               Belgimene: "You have a lot to learn."

                          ---

               Belgimene: "I hope you will do better against Sin, for your
                          sake. You need more training. That much is clear,
                          summoner." [Obtain: Speed Sphere x 30, Aeon's Soul]
                          "The hidden temple, Remiem. I'll be waiting. Come,
                          and I will train you."
               Yuna: "Th-Thank you!"
               Belgimene: "Focus, and grow strong, Yuna. Farewell."

           R2: "No time to fight? I understand. I was in your shoes once."

[The party can take a rest at the travel agency in the middle of the plains. A
man soon walks by.]

Lulu: "Father Zuke!"
Zuke: "Long time no see. You are Yuna? Hmm... You certainly don't look like
      Maester Kinoc's murderer."
Wakka: "What'd you say?"
Yuna: "Please, tell us what has happened!"
Zuke: "Maester Mika just issued a personal order, you know. It said that you
      and your guardians murdered Maester Kinoc and fled. We are to kill you
      on sight, or so it says."
Auron: "What of Bevelle?"
Zuke: "Things are calm on the surface, but the depths are turbulent. After the
      death of Maester Kinoc, Kelk Ronso left Yevon."
Auron: "Convenient. Getting around will be easier with Yevon in disarray."
Zuke: "But be careful, my friends. You have been branded enemies of Yevon. You
      should avoid temples for the time being."
Yuna: "Thank you, Father Zuke, for your warning."
Lulu: "Father, you came all the way here just to tell us this?"
Zuke: "To tell the truth, I was a little curious to see...this summoner you are
      guarding. I hope her pilgrimage goes well. For your sake, too."
Lulu: "Thank you, Father."
Zuke: "I must be off. I shall pray for all of you."
[Zuke leaves.]

       he wanted out... Tell you the truth, I was kinda glad." [2] "Zanarkand's
       right around the corner. So close already.

Naida: "Welcome. What can I do for you?" [Got any weapons?/Got any items?/
       Leave.]

Auron: "Messy."
Tidus: "What is?"
Auron: "Yevon. Mika and Seymour are not of one mind. Remember what Seymour said
       last we met. I do not think Mika will concur."

Auron [2]: "If Yevon founders, so will Spira."

---

Rikku: "She's not stopping, is she?"
Tidus: "Yuna...she's made her decision."
Rikku: "But, I can't just let her go."
Tidus: "We won't have to. We'll save Yuna even if she calls the Final Aeon."
Rikku: "But how?"
Tidus: "I'll think of a way."
Rikku: "But what if you can't?"
Tidus: "I'm tired of talking to you. It's always 'but' this, 'but' that."
Rikku: "But..."
Tidus: "Let's think together!"
Rikku: "Okay!"
Tidus: "And, if we can't think of something...we find another way!"
Rikku: "Okay!"

Rikku [2]: "Ugh... This is a toughie."

Kimahri: "Gagazet is Ronso land. Kimahri home."
Tidus: "Hey! We might meet your family."
Kimahri: "Kimahri has no family."
Tidus: "Oh, sorry."
Kimahri: "But Kimahri not alone."

Kimahri [2]: "Sacred mountain Gagazet. Not change for one thousand years."

---

Tidus: "Who was that?"
Lulu: "Until half a year ago, he was a summoner. Wakka and I were his
      guardians."
Wakka: "It was kinda of a short pilgrimage."
Lulu: "He gave up halfway. Here, on this plain. Now, he is a monk at the
      Bevelle temple."

Lulu [2]: "This is my third pilgrimage as a guardian. Father Zuke was my
          second. And my first, well... It ended here, too. I've never been to
          the lands beyond." [3] "Mt. Gagazet towers to the north, and
          Zanarkand lies beyond that."

---

Yuna: "So, we are officially traitors, then."
Tidus: "Hey, let them say what they want."
Yuna: "It's okay, I'm not worried. Well, maybe just a little. It's so hard not
      to be."
Tidus: "Hey, it's okay to worry. And if it gets too rough, just yell!"
Yuna: "Yell? Hmm... Okay, I might just do that."
Tidus: "Yeah!"

Yuna [2]: "I wonder if my father got lost here, too?"
Tidus: "Maybe, with my old man helping him!"
Yuna: "Maybe I'll ask Sir Auron."
Tidus: "Auron? That grouch never tells me anything."
Yuna: "'That is none of your business!'"
Tidus: "Not that he keeps out of other people's business, you know what I mean?

Yuna [3]: "Just a little farther to Zanarkand."

IF YOU TRY TO GO DOWN UNDER THE BRIDGE AT GAGAZET'S ENTRANCE

Tidus: "This isn't the way in?"
Lulu: "That way leads down into the valley."
Wakka: "Wow, you know your way around, ya?"
[She walks away.]
Wakka: "Huh?

##################
DOWN IN THE VALLEY
##################

Crusader: "This land, where Lady Yocun trained, is sacred to the Crusaders.
          Lady Yocun was a member of the Crusaders before becoming a summoner."
          [2] "We aren't getting enough new recruits to rebuild the Crusaders."

Durren: "High Summoner Yocun once trained in this land. We Crusaders also
        intend to train here, to challenge Sin once again." [2] "Yet, our
        numbers have greatly diminished. Is there nothing we can do now?"

[The party can approach a path that goes down underground:]

Rikku: "Where are we?"
Lulu: "The fayth is inside. As are the fiends."
Wakka: "Hey. This where...?"
Tidus: "Where what?"
Lulu: "The summoner I guarded on my first pilgrimage...died here. Yuna, let's
      go. The fayth awaits."

[The party walks in a ways.]

Rikku: "What's a fayth doing in a place like this?"
Tidus: "Don't ask me!"
Lulu: "They say it was stolen from a temple long ago."
Tidus: "Huh?"
Auron: "With no fayth, summoners cannot trail. Without training, they cannot
       call the Final Aeon. Without the Final Aeon, they cannot defeat Sin.
       That is why."
Rikku: "'Cause then the summoner won't die!"
Wakka: "That must be what the thief was thinking."
Tidus: "I kinda agree with him."

[At the end of the Cave of the Stolen Fayth, Wakka senses something.]

Wakka: "Peh! Another Guado fiend?"
Kimahri: "No. An unsent."
[A woman appears out of pyreflies.]
Lulu: "It is... It's you, is it not, Lady Ginnem? Forgive me. I was too young."
[Yuna tries to send Ginnem but Ginnem stops her.]
Lulu: "There is no human left in you now, is there? Very well, then. Allow me
      to perform my last duty to you. My last as your guardian."
[They fight a samurai-type aeon (Yojimbo) and defeat it.]
Lulu: "Strange. I thought it would be sadder, somehow. Maybe I've gotten used
      to farewells."
Wakka: "You're stronger now."
Lulu: "Wakka, I hope you're right. Yuna, the fayth is inside. Go do what you
      came to do."
[Tidus escorts Yuna to the Fayth. A fayth dressed as a Crusader appears.]
Fayth: "I am the blade of vengeance. They dare only whisper my name: Yojimbo.
       Summoner, I ask you. What do you want of me?"
       R1 --> To train as a summoner.
       R2 --> To gather the power to destroy fiends.
       R3 --> To defeat the most powerful of enemies.

       R1: "If you desire my strength, you must pay my price. Make your offer."
           [Yuna can barter with Yojimbo's 300000 gil price. He says "No deal.
           Maybe next time." if you don't give him a good price. If you give
           him a good price:]
           Fayth: "Adequate... You are my client henceforth. My sword shall
                  guard you on your journey, summoner."
       R2: [Same thing as R1, but w/ lower starting price (270000 Gil).]
       R3: [Same thing as R1, but w/ even lower initial price (250000 Gil).]

Auron: "It is as I thought."
Tidus: "What is?"
Auron: "Yevon is in turmoil. Mika tries to keep it whole, but it crumbles
       around him."
Tidus: "Look, I couldn't care less what happens to Yevon."
Auron: "Because you are not of this world. To those who truly believe in the
       teachings...a time of much pain is coming."

Auron [2]: "Ten years ago, I looked up at Gagazet from where we stand now."
Tidus: "My old man say anything?"
Auron: "I do not remember. All I could think of was how...how I might keep
       Braska alive."

Auron [3]: "Your duties as guardian will soon end."

Wakka: "Gaah, my neck's hurtin'."
Tidus: "Zanarkand's on the other side, huh?"
Wakka: "Yeah...your home, ya?"
Tidus: "As if you believed me."
Wakka: "Maybe I do. The one on the other side here's probably just a pile of
       rubble, ya? But somewhere out there is your Zanarkand. Somewhere, ya?
       Yeah, you'll be home soon enough!"
Tidus: "I...hope you're right."
Wakka: "Yeah! Cheer up! Let's do this!"

Wakka [2]: "Better get ready. Ain't no shops where we're goin'."

Lulu: "Yuna's...grown stronger."
Tidus: "Stronger, huh? I'd say it's more like she's driven, don't you think?"
Lulu: "That's why she's strong. She's still pressing forward. When weak people
      are driven they can't go far before they break. She keeps going forward,
      because she is strong."

Lulu [2]: "Yuna has grown strong. And I... All I can do is try and keep up
          with her." [3] "Let's get ready for the climb."

Kimahri: "Biran and Yenke gone."
Tidus: "I wonder what they're up to? Eh, it's probably nothing!"
Kimahri: "Biran is hero of Ronso. Yenke is powerful warrior."
Tidus: "Great... I hope we don't have to fight them."
Kimahri: "Kimahri must fight. Kimahri must win."

Kimahri [2]: "The sacred Gagazet. First time Kimahri climbs."

Ronso Woman: "To Ronso, losing horn is greatest disgrace. But hornless Kimahri
             return to mountain. Why?" [2] "Kimahri stand tall, unashamed.
             Lose horn, but gain friends."

Ronso Woman: "The cold winds of sacred mountain, sharper than Ronso fangs. It
             stands in way of weak, and buries them in ice." [2] "Prepare your
             body and mind. Reach for the peak of the mountain!

Ronso: "Young or old, Ronso all warriors. All must protect sacred mountain.
       Ronso sharpen fangs, until day of death." [2] "It is great joy to see
       Kimahri return after ten years, a mighty Ronso! With this all is well.
       Praise to Yevon!" [3] "Now, be off. Mount Gagazet awaits."

Ronso: "The sacred heights of Gagazet shun the weak. Use Ronso weapons!"
       [Buy weapons./Buy items./Leave.]

Ronso: "Quarrel between Biran and Kimahri started ten years ago. Young Ronso
       fight each other to show strength. Biran beat Kimahri, but Kimahri never
       admit losing. Not once. Angry Biran broke Kimahri's horn. Kimahri could
       not bear shame and left sacred mountain." [2] "Kimahri talk less after
       horn broken."

Kelk: "Summoner Yuna's words, they ring clear in my soul. Small voice, small
      frame, but a will that towers over Gagazet's peak." [2] "The path to the
      sacred heights is steep, and lined with the dens of fiends. Strong
      guardians, be prepared, and guard your summoner well." [3] "Guard your
      summoner with all your heart."

[The battle starts.]

[Kimahri squares off against Biran and Yenke.]

Biran: "Biran rend you asunder!"

Yenke: "Hornless! Hornless!"

[After dealing a lot of damage to Yenke:]

Yenke: "Weak Ronso should know their place."

[Biran can block Yenke's damage if they're near.]

Biran: "Too slow."

[After Kimahri beats them:]

Biran: "You win, Kimahri Ronso."

AFTER BIRAN/YENKE FIGHT

Ronso: "Biran and Yenke are brave Ronso. No bad feelings for losing duel. They
       will praise valiant Kimahri for winning with own strength." [2] "Kimahri
       beat Biran. Kimahri learn much in ten years."

Ronso: "It must be the guidance of Summoner Yuna that Kimahri gained such
       strength. I extend our gratitude on behalf of all Ronso." [2] "Pursuers
       from Yevon will come soon. Make haste."

Ronso Woman: "Listen to the wind howl! Mt. Gagazet praises Kimahri's victory."

Ronso Woman: "Worry not, small guardian. Summoner's back, we Ronso protect."

Tidus: "Why not?"
Lulu: "Who would send them? They die alone."

Lulu: "Many have become fiends, and they may want Yuna's company."
Tidus: "Well, Yuna will be fine."
Lulu: "You're right."

Wantz: "Greetings, Lady Yuna. My name is Wantz."
Yuna: "We have met several times before, right?"
Tidus: "Not running today?"
Wantz: "I have to carry on my brother's business. You've met him, I think.
       O'aka XXIII, merchant extraordinaire?"
Tidus: "Wait, you're that guy's brother?"
Wantz: "My brother wanted to come help Lady Yuna. But the temple imprisoned
       him for helping traitors."
Tidus: "They imprisoned him because of us?"
Wakka: "He doesn't regret it, though. In fact, he told me before they took
       him...'Don't worry about me, just go help Lady Yuna.'"
Yuna: "But, why would your brother do this for us?"
Wantz: "Well... Hey, this isn't the time for talking! There's dealing to be
       done! Welcome to O'aka's!" [Got any weapons?/Got any items?/Leave.]

[In the screen right before you enter the temple is a monk and a Crusader, who
chase you off if you try to approach.]

Monk: "You, there! Your kind is not welcome in this holy place!"
Crusader: "You shall not pass!

Man: "I've been pulling all-nighters these days. Please let me rest!" [2]
     [Narrative:] He's fallen asleep.

Man: "My night shift has been doubled by the captain's orders. Doubled!
     There's no way I can do that! Just hire more hands if you want more
     work done." [2] "There's no use griping, but sometimes that's the only
     thing I can do."

Man: "Youngsters nowadays are so rowdy. I can hardly hear myself think in
     town." [2] "I'd rather spend time with my dogs than hang around
     townsfolk."

Girl: "I envy how laid back the Lucans are. They're always crazy about
      blitzball, even when something terrible happens." [2] "I like blitzball
      too, but even I can't get that deep into it."

Man: "Once Sin comes, everything we worked for will be lost. So why bother to
     work at all? I've got better ways to spend the time I have left." [2]
     "Ahh... Basking in the sun is such a great luxury."

Woman: "He used to be a hard worker, too. But now, he's always like this." [2]
       "Sometimes I even wonder why I stay with him at all."

Man: "It's not that...I like riding ships... But this...urp...is the only
     way... The waves, winds...and chocobos...cause the ship to rock. But it's
     better than the shoopuf... Last time, I...urp...on the shoopuf...and got
     an earful...from the Hypello..." [2] "Ugh... Just talking about it...gets
     me sick... Urrp... H-Help!"

Captain: "I heard the Al Bhed attacked Bevelle with a flying ship. Maester
         Seymour's wedding got cancelled and everything!" [2] "Those dirty Al
         Bhed! What's so fun about ruining a wedding?"

Man: "Maester Kinoc has passed away and Maester Kelk Ronso has resigned. Now
     that Maester Seymour's disappeared as well, all of Yevon is in chaos." [2]
     "I had such high hopes for Maester Seymour. He was truly dedicated to
     saving Spira."

Man: "I ran out of Bevelle as fast as I could, so I didn't pack any
     summer clothes."

Crusader: "Th-That flying ship... Have the Al Bhed finally brought out their
          big guns? I hope they will avenge the fallen Crusaders for me!"

Hypello: "I wonderss what that ship ish? An anshient mashina?"

Li'l Hypello: "Thish ish a big ribber. You shink shoopuf can make it here

Boy: "Sis once got caught trying to sneak onto that ferry."

Girl: "I want to be a sailor and sail all over Spira when I grow up."

Woman: "Hey, hey, outta my way! I'm tryin' to work here!"

Crusader: "With the warrior monks gone, it's up to use Crusaders to defend
          Luca."

Crusader: "Whenever guard duty gets boring, I try to remember how much the
          Crusaders need me right now."

Li'l Crusader: "Nothing out of the ordinary, sir!"

DOCK NUMBER THREE

Bickson: "Whether you're a traitor or not means nothing in the sphere pool."

Graav: "We're going to keep blitzing no matter what becomes of the temple."

Abus: "Rumor has it that you guys are traitors. Some people sure talk rubbish."

Raudy: "Both the Ronso and the Al Bhed teams play extra hard to help cheer
       their fans up."

Balgerda: "What in Spira's name is the temple thinking these days?"

Doram: "You always seem to be walking around. When do you have time to
       practice?"

DOCK NUMBER FOUR

Al Bhed Woman: "A flying ship, huh? What will they think of next?"

Crusader: "Those Ronso players are massive! I feel like they're here to guard
          us instead of the other way around."

Li'l Crusader: "I may be enjoying the game, but I'm keeping watch, too.
               Everything's okay here!"

Gazna Ronso: "Maester Kelk Ronso was slain while defending the mountain. For
             Ronso, no better way to die."

Argai Ronso: "If Ronso Fangs win, our brothers on the Farplane will rejoice."

Basik Ronso: "Ronso shed no tear when brothers die. Pain and sorrow will never
             conquer mighty Ronso spirit."

Nuvy Ronso: "The Crusaders stand strong once more. We admire their fortitude."

Zamzi Ronso: "No longer can temple help us. Must protect Spira on our own."

Irga Ronso: "Ronso are pious race. But cannot trust temple now."

DOCK NUMBER FIVE
################

Woman: "This dock is so quiet compared to the others."

Zev Ronso: "Warrior monks run away to Bevelle. They abandon the people. Should
           hide their faces in shame."

Crusader: "If guard duty's taught me anything, it's the importance of checking
          every nook and cranny. Trust me, it pays off."

STADIUM FRONT

Man: "I've decided to join the Crusaders. No sense hiding behind their backs
     all the time."

Woman: "Hey, when are you playin' next? I really want to see you again."

Man: "The flying ship at dock 1 is the legendary airship! So the tales are
     true!"

Guard: "The Crusaders will help us with security! We will support them all the
       way!"

Crusader: "Once the Crusaders regroup in Luca, they will charge through the
          Mi'ihen Highroad and lay waste to all the fiends!"

Man: "I think the Crusaders are more suited to Luca than the warrior monks are.

Woman: "I quit the Crusaders after the operation, but I'm back again. I think I
       have Crusader blood running through my veins."

Man: "The warrior monks have left, but the Crusaders have returned to serve as
     guards. A blessing from Yevon indeed!"

Woman: "Did you know that you're more popular than ever, now that you're
       branded a traitor?"

Crusader: "The merchants of Luca have raised money to support the Crusaders."

Crusader: "Even through all the hardship, the people of Luca enjoy blitzball
          and carry on with their lives. Oh, how I admire their strength."

Biggs: "The people of Luca will always stand behind a blitzer -- even one
       condemned as a traitor."

Wedge: "Most of the warrior monks have withdrawn to Bevelle, but some have
       taken a liking to Luca and remained here."

Woman: "So many people... Much more than in the Calm Lands."

Man: "Such a free-spirited city... I do not wish to return to Bevelle."

Guard: "The warrior monks have left, but the Crusaders are back to help guard
       the area."

Guard: "People from all over Spira gather here. The monks of Yevon, the Al
       Bhed, Crusaders, warrior monks, Ronso, Guado, you name it. People of
       different cultures and values come together as one to cheer on
       blitzball. There is no other place in Spira as wonderful as this."

Crusader: "I'm off duty. Let me be."

Woman: "I've seen many things in my time at sea, but nothing like that flying
       ship at dock number 1."

Man: "Nothing beats watching a blitz game after a long stint at sea."

Keepa: "Actually, I'm relieved to hear that Yuna's wedding is called off."

Botta: "I-I'll always be on Yuna's side."

Datto: "No one's gonna believe that Yuna is a traitor, man."

Letty: "The temple has pardoned the Crusaders. It's a little too late for that,
       ya?"

Jassu: "I already knew about Yuna's lineage. I just kept my mouth shut in front
       of Wakka."

ROAD TO STADIUM

Warrior Monk: "You! You're that traitor!"
Warrior Monk 2: "Let him go. Even the two of us won't be able to overpower him.
Warrior Monk: "But what about our duties to the temple?"
Warrior Monk 2: "Our duties? We missed the ship to Bevelle! They're not coming
                back for us! We're nothing now!"

Warrior Monk 2 [2]: "You'd probably kick my butt anyway."

Warrior Monk [2]: "We wear the armor of the temple, but it doesn't mean a
                  thing."

Woman: "I saw a flying ship at dock number 1. Think that's gonna beat Sin?"

Short Guy: "The city of Luca keeps on blitzin', even with all the turmoil goin'
           on these days. Even the faltering of the Yevon temple won't change
           that." [2] "Even if Sin were to attack today, the people of Luca
           would probably be more interested in tomorrow's match."

Man: "The flying ship is a forbidden machina, but we should just get it
     approved by the temple."

Woman: "I hear the mood in Guadosalam is as gloomy as the Farplane."

Woman: "I'm glad the Crusaders are in high spirits, but I'm just worried
       they'll come up with another reckless plan."

Man: "I'm just worried that Sin might attack Kilika again."

Man: "The temple is in a state of chaos, but we must remain strong and keep
     faith in the teachings as we wait for the Calm.

Cameraman: "If you want to be interviewed, show us your most outrageous gag,
           okay?"

Shaami: "Even as faith in Yevon clergy dwindles, the temple remains silent,
        choosing not to issue any official statement on the matter. Many are
        protesting the cold and insensitive manner in which the temple has
        treated the people. There have even been reports of a mass exodus from
        Bevelle by dejected temple followers... Wh-What do you think you're
        doing!? Can't you see I'm working here? You sure are a show-off, aren't
        you!" [2] "We have unconfirmed reports that Maester Seymour has
        committed an unspeakable crime... Will you move!?"

Woman: "Sin hasn't attacked lately. That's making me even more nervous."

Fat Man: "Having that airship would make travelling between Luca and Kilika
         a lot easier..."

Woman: "Those warrior monks were useless. They didn't do a thing."

Man: "The only thing people can really do is pray for the Calm."

Man: "The temple's probably devising a grand plan. That's why they're not
     doing anything right now."

Man: "I hear the warrior monks invaded Besaid. They were looking for some
     traitors."

Monk: "Some of Luca's residents are making light of the teachings. What
      sacrilege."

Nun: "The Macalania temple is losing its faith. I do not wish to live there
     anymore."

ROAD TO SPHERE THEATER

Zalitz: "I quit the sailor's life because I'm terrified of Sin. I'm too
        ashamed to face my shipmates."

Li'l Crusader: "A fiend might be attracted to the music! Keep your eyes open
               and stay alert!"

Li'l Nun: "The monks have been looking stern lately. I wonder what's gonna
          happen to the temple?"

Man: "Those stuck-up warrior monks ran back to Bevelle crying for their
     mommies. Spineless bastards!"

SPHERE THEATER

Li'l Crusader: "You should check the sphere monitor before you set out. You'll
               find useful information in there."

Crusader: "Gathering data for travellers is an important part of a Crusader's
          duties, too."

Li'l Hypello: "That drummer lookss like ush... Maybe he'sh a big relative of
              Hypello?"

Hypello: "Thish ishn't the sthadium...? I shink I'm losht."

Crusader: "Luca is a free city. The fiends could have snuck in from anywhere.

Woman: "I can't do business with the temple the way it is. I hope they get
       their act together soon."

Girl: "There's a flying ship at the port! That's a forbidden machina, isn't it?

Woman: "My husband likes the warrior monks, but I simply can't bear them."

Jumal: "Not all of the Crusaders are armed well. They seem inferior to the
       warrior monks."

Man: "The warrior monks left Luca without a word. Who do they think they are?"

Woman: "I don't know much about religion, but there's something weird about
       the temple."

Man: "Hurray! With the Crusaders back I feel like we could take on two Sins!"

Fat Man: "Even the temple makes mistakes. The monks are only human, after all."

Man: "The warrior monk? She's not around anymore. I missed my chance at her."

Guado Woman: "I don't want to go back to Guadosalam because it reminds me of
             my brother."

Man: "Maester Kinoc was always concerned for the safety of the people. It's a
     shame to have lost him."

Man: "What's wrong with the temple these days? They're hopeless when we need
     them most!"

Woman: "I wonder how the wedding was? Haven't heard anything from the temple
       yet."

Short Guy: "I heard that the Guado razed the Al Bhed's hometown. That's
           horrible!"

Man: "I shouldn't say this out loud, but the temples are way outta line! Dang
     it, I said it out loud..."

Warrior Monk: "The temple is a wreck. I really want to quit the warrior monks."
Crusader: "Then join the Crusaders! We'd love to have you join our force."

Crusader [2]: "I'd like to recruit as many as possible and rebuilt the
              Crusaders."

Warrior Monk [2]: "Never expected that the Crusaders would try to recruit me.
                  Not in a million years."

Woman: "The high summoner's daughter would never turn traitor. The temple must
       be mistaken."

Shuu: "Is Lady Yuna a traitor or not? With everyone gabbing, I don't know what
      to believe."

Man: "We should hold a blitzball tournament to aid Yevon in this time of
     crisis."

Man: "The temple's in chaos? Really? That's too bad, but we've got other
     problems to worry about, like blitzball."

Crusader: "The Crusaders are guarding the stadium. If any fiends appear, we'll

Crusader: "The youth of Luca are flocking to the Crusaders in droves! Lord

Man: "Fiends are lurking everywhere. I have to be on my toes constantly." [2]
     "They really need to guard the Highroad better. The Crusaders, the warrior
     monks, I don't care who handles it, as long as it's safe." [3] "I suppose
     it's too much to ask to secure a remote area like this one. Out here, it's
     every man for himself."

Fat Man: "This is a statue of Lord Mi'ihen, who founded the Crusaders several
         hundred years ago. Lord Mi'ihen passed along this very road on his
         way to St. Bevelle. Ever since then, this road has been known as
         Mi'ihen Highroad. [2] "Lord Mi'ihen faithfully followed the teachings,
         unlike Crusaders these days."

Man: "There are seven legends about Lord Mi'ihen's statue...but they're all
     so absurd!" [2] "They say the eyes follow you when you're not looking,
     and that it gets up and walks around in the night! Silly, isn't it?"
     [3] "There's a legend that Lord Mi'ihen's sword still exists somewhere. I
     think it's just an ancient myth."

Man: "There's gotta be something here... I can feel it. But no matter how hard
     I look, I can't find a thing." [2] "There should be inscriptions of some
     sort here. Aw, well... I probably wouldn't be able to read them anyway."
     [3] "Hey! What's that? Ha! Made you look!"

Woman: "I fled Bevelle and came here. I got sick of living there. It was so
       unsettling, what with the priests' meddling and the warrior monks'
       arrogance." [2] "Yevon had better start getting its act together."

Girl: "I'm not playing. I'm practicing with my brother." [2] "It's important
      to train. You never know what's gonna happen." [3] "I have to become
      strong like my brother so that I'll be able to run away like him if
      fiends attack us."

Man: "My sister wanted to play, so we came here. I didn't expect to see so
     many fiends." [2] "I'll have no problems outrunning fiends, but I doubt
     my sister could. I'm gonna pray we don't run into any." [3] "If there were
     no fiends in Spira, we wouldn't even have to worry like this."

Woman: "You look awful depressed, and it's such a beautiful day." [2] "When
       I'm feeling down, I come here and take a walk. Nothing like a breath of
       fresh air to clear your mind." [3] "There are some things that can't be
       helped."

Man: "Sorry, I don' feel like talking anymore." [2] "Just leave me alone."

Man: "The collapse of the Crusaders, the conflict in Bevelle...I fear for
     Spira's future." [2] "All we can do is trust the summoners. I feel so
     helpless."

Woman: "There are more and more Al Bheds coming here. I don't know if it's
       good or bad." [2] "I'm still not comfortable being around Al Bhed. Maybe
       I should get to know them, but I don't speak the language."

Monk: "It was time for me to leave the temple and travel the world. Along
      the way, I hope to spread the teachings to the people I meet." [2]
      "Also, I plan to learn Al Bhed. Nothing will be solved unless we begin
      a dialogue."

Crusader: "We are receiving many refugees from Bevelle. They have suffered a
          trying journey here, and it is our duty to protect them from
          fiends." [2] "The warrior monks were guarding the Highroad just
          recently. Now they're gone. How irresponsible of them."

Al Bhed Kid: "Fa meja eh dra tacand, cu E ryja hajan caah cu syho vmufanc."
             [2] "E mega dra vmufan rana yht dra vmufan eh dra tacand. E mega
             dras pudr." ["We live in the desert, so I have never seen so many
             flowers."] [2] ["I like the flower here and the flower in the
             desert. I like them both."]

Man: "There are some Al Bhed wandering around. What are they up to now?" [2]
     "The Al Bhed wouldn't be acting so big if the warrior monks were here."

Crusader: "There aren't many guards beyond here, so watch it." [2] "Ideally,
          we'd like to station men at the Mushroom Rock Road, too. But we're
          really shorthanded. Please understand."

Crusader: "We've been so busy with guard duty, we've been using that cage as
          shelter. Praise be to Yevon that nobody cleared it after the
          operation." [2] "The Al Bhed from the travel agency bring us food
          now and then. I still don't understand them, but they're my friends
          as long as they feed us."

     They're a fearless bunch. You can only admire them." [2] "If only Lady

Woman: "We're hoping to return to our hometown of Kilika. First we must cross
       the Moonflow, pass through Djose, then travel the Mushroom Rock Road
       and the Mi'ihen Highroad... After that, it's onto the S.S. Winno...
       Phew! There's a long way to go, isn't there?" [2] "I wonder how long

     of Sin if we lived in the heart of Yevon... Boy, was I wrong. I expended
     all my energy coming here and I can't run any farther."

Woman: "The Al Bhed seem docile nowadays, but it always pays to be cautious."

[An auto-scene cues upon entering Guadosalam.]

Tromell: "Why are you in Guadosalam? What business have you here?"
Tidus: "You wanna start something?"
Tromell: "If it would please you to harm a defenseless old man...then burn me,
         boil me, it matters not. Lord Seymour is gone. No lord rises to take
         his place. The Guado merely wait for Sin to come and finish us off.
         Why should I care what you do to me? If it meant rejoining Lord Jyscal
         and Lord Seymour...then your taking off my head would be the greatest
         kindness."

###################
AFTER TROMELL SCENE
###################

Tromell: "Come to kill the old man? I welcome it!" [2] "Or are you here to
         laugh? Laugh at the fallen Guado?" [Tromell walks to the screen before
         the Farplane gates where he then stands.]

Guado: "No one may enter this lordless manor."

Nav Guado: "Now that Seymour is dead, no one knows who will rise to take his
           place. That means I still have a chance." [2] "Once I lead the
           Guado Glories to victory, I will become the next lord here. Until
           then, the Farplane cannot have me! Whatever it takes, I will live
           to see that day." [3] "No one will lord over the Guado but me!
           Mwahahaha."

Guado Woman: "Everyone will die. Guado, humans, Ronso, and Al Bhed! Only Sin
             will remain, forever!" [2] "Once everyone in Spira's dead, it'll
             get really stuffy on the Farplane." [3] "Keeheehee!"

Guado Woman: "We lost so many in the recent struggles..." [2] "My best friend
             walks the Farplane. I...I can't go on like this." [3] "I want to
             go to him... To see him on the Farplane."

Auda Guado: "Lord Seymour's aeon destroyed the fiends that appeared in Luca
            Stadium. That display of Lord Seymour's raw power struck me
            speechless. But it was all a show. I feel so..." [2] "I'm sorry. I
            cannot put it into words."

Giera Guado: "The Guado are deeply saddened by the loss of so many of our own.
             If only I could restore their cheer through blitzball." [2] "No
             Guado has the strength to weave dark conspiracies any more.

Creepy Guado: "We have no intention of fighting you, for we know that we cannot
              win." [2] "Many brave Guado have given their lives. Now, only a
              handful remain."

Guado: "Many a Guado met an untimely death in the name of Lord Seymour. With
       most of our youth dead now, the future of the Guado appears grim
       indeed." [2] "Living with the Farplane as we do, we Guado live with
       death every day. We are prepared to face our own deaths at Sin's hand."

Guado Woman: "What happened to Lord Seymour? I heard the rumors, but I can't
             believe it." [2] "How could Lord Seymour do that to Lord Jyscal?"

Yuma Guado: "Some say that it was the Guado who threw Spira into chaos. It
            pains me to admit it, but they're right." [2] "Luca has informed
            us that the Guado team may continue to compete in tournaments. We
            were saved by the Lucans' generosity."

Old Woman: "Lord Seymour took many lives. It seems he is now revenged on both
           Guado and human." [2] "In wedding that human maiden, Lord Jyscal
           broke ancient tradition. Some rebell'd at Lord Seymour's birth,
           desiring the half-breed child driven off. To quell the outcry,
           Lord Jyscal tearfully exiled his wife and son to Baaj Island."
           [3] "Years later, Lord Seymour returned. He said his mother had
           died. But he was no longer the lost child banish'd so long ago.
           He had returned a master of the summoner's art. The half-breed
           boy once so reviled thus reversed his fortunes and won deep
           respect." [4] "They say Lord Seymour discovered his gift for
           summoning as a mere child."

Old Man: "Our youth are all dead. Our future seemeth likewise dead. O that
         the Guado had remained here, protecting the Farplane instead of
         populating it!" [2] "With Lord Seymour gone, Tromell hath lost all
         hope. Belike he will soon follow his master to the Farplane." [3]
         "Sin will surely crush the Guado now.

Guado: "Following a half-human was our fatal mistake. Seymour destroyed the
       Guado single-handedly. Him alone." [2] "Tromell now spends his days
       mourning on the Farplane. You won't get a word out of him."

Guado Woman: "I prayed and prayed on the Farplane, but Lord Seymour did not
             appear." [2] "I don't care who it is, I just want someone to
             lead the Guado back to greatness."

Zazi Guado: "It's true that many tossed themselves to the Farplane in Lord
            Seymour's name. But until recently, I looked up to him so much.
            So I guess I'd be a hypocrite to belittle him. I might come across
            as proud, but my pride is all I have left."

Pah Guado: "Our captain is aiming for bigger goals now. He says he'll take
           the helm of the Guado! I wonder if he's really serious. How much
           Guado life would change with a blitzer in charge..."

Noy Guado: "Some advice from one blitzer to another: stay away from

[A scene with Lulu and Lady Ginnem plays, but only after defeating the latter

Lulu: "I'm still not the person I wanted to become, not yet. I'll come back to
      let you know how things went."

Lulu [2]: "I hope I'll bring back...good news."

[After finding Mika on Highbridge (?), Tromell will be talking with Jyscal.]

Tromell: "When Lord Jyscal was alive, the Guado knew prosperity and honor.
         But now, we Guado wither and crumble. I, myself, could have done
         more to stop this. Forgive me, Lord Jyscal!"

Lulu [2]: "Lord Jyscal! I beg your forgiveness!"

[A family can also be found on the Farplane at some time, visiting a man:]

Woman: "I hope you live your next life in a world without Sin. Do not
       return to Spira." [2] "Those who are born into Spira are destined
       to live a life of sorrow."

Man: "All your hard work and effort to become a monk has been in vain. Oh,
     how I was looking forward to that day." [2] "Rest in peace on the
     Farplane. We shall join you soon."

Warrior Monk: "The road to Bevelle is closed. None may pass." [2] "It's been
              several days since I was ordered to guard this road. I haven't
              received any new orders since then...they better not have
              forgotten about me." [3] "I guess I'll have to keep watch until
              I receive new orders."

Woman: "There are so many warrior monks passing by lately. Did something
       happen at the temple?"

Guado Woman: "Please, I need my rest. This long trip has tired me." [After
             talking to other Guado Woman nearby:] [2] "I'd like to apologize
             on behalf of the Guado. We are responsible for the fiends that
             attacked the stadium after the game. We're sorry for the
             disturbance and for disrupting such a wonderful game. Please
             accept our apologies." [3] "It was Maester Seymour's plan to
             release the fiends into Luca Stadium. He thought he could win
             the trust of the people by defeating the fiends with his aeon.
             I heard that his plan to marry the high summoner's daughter was
             solely to gain the support of the people of Yevon. There seem to
             have been other reasons as well, but now, we will never know."
             [4] "By obeying Maester Seymour, we Guado have committed an
             inexcusable crime. It's far too late to try shifting the blame to
             Maester Seymour. Within time, the Guado will be as despised as
             the Al Bhed." [5] "That child's brother was Maester Seymour's
             subordinate. He died while invading the Al Bhed hideout, searching
             for the lost summoners. He was never sent... I fear he now wanders
             as a fiend." [6] "The power of the Guado has greatly deteriorated.
             They merely await the inevitable, now. That is why I brought that
             child and moved away from Guadosalam. Perhaps we will find peace
             in some far away land." [7] "I still haven't told that child the
             truth about the Guado. Perhaps when he grows older and can accept
             the reality of the situation...only then will I reveal the truth
             about everything to him." [8] "I'm tired now after talking so
             long. I'm not as young as I used to be."

Guado: "Hey, aren't you one of the Besaid Aurochs? You are a blitzball
       player? There is something I must tell you." [2] "Grandma says
       she has something important to tell you." [After talking to his
       grandma:] [3] "Guadosalam's no fun these days. Everyone's so sad there.
       That's why I'm going on a journey with my grandmother." [4] "We're going
       to rest here until grandma feels better."

Maechen: "Shall I tell you about the Spira of days long past, eh?"
         R1 --> Maybe next time.
         R2 --> I'd love to hear.

         R1: "Hmph. Suit yourself."
         R2: "There is a legend, you know. Just before the horrible Sin
             appeared...a terrible war raged between Bevelle and Zanarkand.
             When the armies of Bevelle attacked Mount Gagazet, they heard a
             song echoing across the snowy slopes. ''Tis a song from an
             otherworld,' they said. The soldiers panicked and ran. And then,
             as if to pursue the retreating armies, Sin appeared! Some time
             later, scouts from Bevelle braved the mountain. On the other side,
             they witnessed the ruins that had been Zanarkand. The city
             destroyed. Not a single soul left standing. Gone! In its place, a
             multitude of the fayth had gathered on Gagazet. They were singing
             a song. It's the song we now call the 'Hymn of the Fayth.' And
             that, as they say, is that. Well...maybe not all of it."

Maechen [2]: "Would you like to hear the rest?"
             R1 --> Maybe next time.
             R2 --> Let's continue.

             R1: "Hmph. Suit yourself."
             R2: "Rumors flew in Bevelle about Sin's sudden appearance. They
                 said that the people of Zanarkand became the fayth, that they
                 had called Sin. And that the man responsible...was none other
                 than the summoner Yevon, ruler of Zanarkand! Yes, the lord
                 father of Lady Yunalesca. On the eve of Zanarkand's
                 destruction, Lady Yunalesca...had fled to safety with her
                 husband, Zaon. Later, the two used the Final Summoning to
                 defeat Sin. Yet the people of Bevelle still feared Yu Yevon.
                 It was to quell his wrath that they revered him, and first
                 spread his teachings. And so were born the temples of Yevon. I
                 suppose it's possible Yunalesca had planned it that way from
                 the start! A fair trade, she defeats Sin in exchange for her
                 lord father's honor. Of course, there's no proof. No, the
                 facts are lost in the mists of time. And who'd admit Yevon was
                 an enemy of Bevelle? You can bet the temples had a hand in
                 covering that one up! And that, as they say, is that."

Maechen [3]: "Like to hear more, would you?"
             R1 --> Maybe next time.
             R2 --> Continue.

             R1: "Hmph. Suit yourself."
             R2: "Let me tell you about the Hymn of the Fayth. It was once a
                 Zanarkand song, sung in defiance of Bevelle! Of course, the
                 Yevon clergy of Bevelle forbade it. Then, as these things
                 often go, those who disliked Yevon began to sing it. The Al
                 Bhed, for instance. The Hymn of the Fayth became the symbol
                 of defiance against Yevon. Yevon could do nothing but
                 capitulate. They lifted the ban on the song, and spread a
                 new story. They said the hymn was a song sung to soothe the
                 souls of the dead. And so saying, they took the song and made
                 it scripture. That's why today, the hymn is sung all over
                 Spira. You could say that, though Zanarkand is gone from this
                 world, it lives on in the song. Aaaah, but look at the time.
                 I've rambled on again. I do love stories, you see. Well, I
                 owe you my gratitude for hearing this old scholar out."

Maechen [4]: "Like to hear about this place once more?"
             R1 --> Never mind.
             R2 --> The destruction of Zanarkand.
             R3 --> Yevon and Yunalesca.
             R4 --> The Hymn of the Fayth.

             R1: "Hmph. Suit yourself."
             R2: [The first paragraph is repeated.]
             R3: [The second paragraph is repeated.]
             R4: [The third paragraph is repeated.]

Old Man: "Not many visitors at the temple these days. It is a pity, really."

Woman: "Is that flying ship one of Yevon's machina? Yes, let us assume so."

Crusader: "I've givin' up on becoming a warrior monk. They value the temple
          over the people of Spira. I can't believe they abandoned their
          positions in Kilika and ran off." [2] "The warrior monk leaders have

Warrior Monk: "No, no, I am not a warrior monk! I have rejoined the Crusaders.

Man: "A lot of people are leaving Bevelle. I hear the temple's really clamping
     down on things there." [2] "I hear the priests worry more about themselves
     than the people. If Maester Mika were still alive, this never would've
     happened." [3] "Maybe Sin fell on Bevelle to punish the temple and what
     it's become."

          Sin. But at least we can protect the people from fiends." [3] "We

Woman: "Fiends often appear here, but people pass through, regardless." [2]
       "Sin's terrible attacks continue, and the fiends' threats persist...
       Yet people continue to move on." [3] "Still, fiends are frightening as

       It's strange how we can all sing the same song even though we don't

       yeh'd ed?" ["I'm hungry."] [2] ["No one's coming to pick me up."]
       [3] ["It's cold, ain't it?"]

Monk: "The Guado have left the temple, restoring peace to this holy place."
      [2] "It's a relief that those troubling folk are gone."

####################
MACALANIA GREAT HALL
####################

Old Woman: "Those who once criticized the Al Bhed are now blaming the Guado.
           Hmph, always blaming others for everything. Have they no shame?"
           [2] "Hmph, the Ronso will probably be singled out next. Just you
           watch."

Monk: "The high priest of Macalania Temple was Maester Seymour. A new high
      priest has not yet been appointed in his place. We await further
      instructions from St. Bevelle." [2] "The temple cannot operate much
      longer without a high priest."

Nun: "Before, both humans and Guado came to pray at the temple. Now, nobody
     comes. How long before our own hearts grow chill and void of faith?" [2]
     "These are times when I think about quitting the clergy and going home."

[In the monks' chambers:]

Monk: "With Seymour gone and Maester Mika dead...we've lost our emotional
      support." [2] "This is truly a disgrace. Monks are supposed to guide
      the people, not behave like this."

Li'l Nun: "The Guado used to come here often, but now, everyone's gone." [2]
          "I miss my Guado friends."

Monk: "Seymour's actions are inexcusable, but I cannot condemn him...because
      I remember how he suffered at the hands of both human and Guado in his
      youth." [2] "If he hadn't strayed from the path, I believe Seymour would
      have become a fine maester."

Nun: "The Guado have apparently lost their willpower and are in low spirits.
     They never leave Guadosalam anymore." [2] "I feel like shutting myself
     away in a temple, too. I just can't believe anything anymore."

[In the nuns' chambers:]

Monk: "The temple undergoes its own trial of faith, now. If only a leader
      would appear to restore its former glory." [2] "In time, the Guado will
      come to see the light of Yevon, too."

Woman: "Ever since that incident involving Lord Seymour, I've had a hard time
       sleeping at night." [2] "Wish I'd never seen that sphere."

Fayth: "Should the dreaming end, you too will disappear -- Fade into Spira's

       human. That is why we must dream. Let us summon a sea in a new dream
       world. A new sea for you to swim." [Obtain: Magic Sphere]

[The party can run into Maroda and Pacce (auto-scene):]

Maroda: "Hold there! This bridge is closed. Bevelle is off limits by the
        temple's decree. No one may enter."
Pacce: "Everyone's in mourning since Maester Mika died... And it's been
       morning for days now!"
Maroda: "Pacce... At least, that's what they say. The temple's falling apart
        with all four maesters gone. They're afraid of riots, so they're
        turning everyone away. With our brother in the middle..."
Tidus: "What's up with Isaaru?"
Maroda: "They came crying to him to stay in Bevelle, protect the temple and
        all that. And you know our brother. It's not in him to refuse."
Pacce: "Oh, I guess our pilgrimage is done, then, huh?"
Maroda: "Of course not! Geez... Long story short... You'll only find trouble
        in Bevelle. I'd stay out for your own safety."

---

Maroda: "That whole bit about Yuna being a traitor's just some Al Bhed rumor,
        I hear. I just can't believe it. I mean, the Al Bhed helped us out!"
        [2] "Wait all you want. Bevelle's gates are closed."

Pacce: "Isaaru sends his regards to Lady Yuna. And...he's says he's sorry,
       too." [2] "I heard something funny the other day. If a flying ship
       sings, we're supposed to sing along! And they say that will beat Sin!"

Cid: "We're counting on you, kid." [NavMap opens.]

Auron: "I'd like to meet Jecht before he fades away." [2] "When this is all
       over, I will leave. I have played at life too long." [3] "Ten years
       ago...I honored Jecht's last words, and travelled to Zanarkand. I
       planned to stay there, watching over you. But when Sin attacked
       Zanarkand that day, I changed my mind. Outside the dream world, life
       can be harsh -- even cruel. But it is life. He wanted you to have a
       shot at life. I saw it in Sin's eyes. That's why I brought you here,
       to Spira."

Wakka: "We been through a lot, ya? And hey, we're not finished yet!" [2] "All
       Spira's rooting for us! Let's not let them down, ya?" [3] "And to
       think, if you hadn't come floating out of the sea that day."

Yuna: "No matter what happens, I'll see this through to the end. I promise."
      [2] "We're almost done."

Yuna [3]: "How are you doing?"
          R1 --> Never better!
          R2 --> Okay.
          R3 --> Not so good.

          R1: "You know, I am too."
          R2: "Really? I'm great...thanks to you."
          R3: "I see. You don't have to smile, if it's too tough."

      "You know, your meeting Yuna was really quite..." [3] "Can't say 'Praise

Jecht: "What of it?"
[Auron runs into the frame.]
Auron: "Watch your tongue, knave!"

        place."
Jecht: "Sounds sweet. What's the catch?"
Braska: "Ahhaha... That easy to see, was it? I soon leave on a pilgrimage...to
        Zanarkand."
Jecht: "Seriously?"
Braska: "I would like you to join us. It will be a dangerous trip. Yet, if we
        do reach Zanarkand...my prayers will be answered, and you will be able
        to go home, we think. What say you?"
Jecht: "Great, let's go!"
Braska: "So quick?"
Jecht: "Anything to get outta here!"
Braska: "Then it's settled."
Auron: "But I must protest... This drunkard a guardian?"
Jecht: "Hey! You want to step in here and say that?"
Braska: "What does it matter? No one truly believes that I, a fallen summoner
        wed to an Al Bhed...could possibly defeat Sin. This is what they say.
        No one expects us to succeed."
Auron: "Braska, sir..."
Braska: "Let's show them they're wrong. A fallen summoner, a man from
        Zanarkand...and a warrior monk, doomed to obscurity for refusing the
        hand of the priest's daughter. What delightful irony it would be if we
        defeated Sin!"
Jecht: "Stop gabbin' and get me outta here!"
[The sphere picks up later, after Jecht is out of jail.]
Jecht: "Ahh... Free at last!"

Braska: "Hello, Yuna. I hope you are well. I wonder how old you are, now that
        you're watching this sphere. You must be very beautiful, like your
        mother. I wish I could see you. Oh, by the way...Jecht and Auron send
        their regards. So far, our journey has been very entertaining. Of
        course, it is a hard journey, but I have no regrets. It is the path I
        have chosen. Yuna, when you have grown, you will have to find your own
        path. Do what you must do, the way you want to do it. Doors will always
        open themselves to those who do. Listen close, Yuna. Your future is
        yours to make. Live the way you want to. Whatever way that may be, you
        have your father's full support. Yuna, I will always be with you."

Auron: "My lord?"
Braska: "When this is over...could you bring Yuna here? I want her to lead a
        life away from this conflict."
Auron: "You have my word. I will bring her here."
Braska: "Thank you, Auron. You are a good friend."
Jecht: "What are you guys doin'? Let's go! I'm so hungry, I could eat a
       shoopuf whole!""
Braska: "Sorry. Well, let's go then."
[The sphere clicks off as they head towards the temple.]

IV. S.S. Liki
-------------

[Auron and Braska are shown on the deck; Jecht is the cameraman.]
Jecht: "After you get that aeon from Besaid... Where're we going?"
Auron: "Back the way we came. Then we go north from Bevelle and climb Mt.
       Gagazet."
Braska: "Beyond it lies...Zanarkand."
Jecht: "Zanarkand, huh? It's been in ruins for a thousand years, right?"
Auron: "So the legends say. No one knows for sure. It still could be your
       Zanarkand."
Jecht: "Thanks for trying, Auron."
[The sphere picks up later with Braska as cameraman. Jecht is in the frame.]
Jecht: "I thought if I went with you guys I might find a way to go back. But
       it's not that easy."
Braska: "I'm sorry."
Jecht: "No need to apologize, Braska. It's not your fault. I should be thinking
       about fighting Sin now, anyway. Zanarkand can wait. But I will find my
       way back!"
Braska: "Be careful, Jecht."
Jecht: "Hey, I'll be all right. You're the one that should be careful. Wouldn't
       want your little girl to cry."
Braska: "She'll be all right. She's strong, like her mother was."
[She sphere ends.]

[The sphere shows the docks. Auron is the cameraman.]
Jecht: "Hey, Auron! Did you get that last match?"
Auron: "Yeah. But I don't understand why you wanted me to. Didn't you say you
       have blitzball in your Zanarkand?"
Jecht: "Not a sportsman, are ya?"
Braska: "Working on your form?"
Jecht: "My form don't need no work. I'm the great Jecht. It's for my kid."
Braska: "Your son plays blitzball?"
Jecht: "Yeah, and he wants to beat his old man bad. Once, I told him to give
       it up. He didn't speak to me for a week. Wonder what he's doing now. I
       hope he got bigger and put on some muscle."
[Auron closes in on him.]
Jecht: "Hey, what's the big idea! Stop shooting!"
[The sphere shuts off.]

-------------------
VI. Mi'ihen Oldroad

[The three-man team is up by the travel agency. Auron is cameraman.]
Braska: "A giant fiend that attacks chocobos..."
Jecht: "Hmph. What's it waiting for? Hey! Come out and fight!"
Auron: "I told you this was a waste of time."
Jecht: "Hey, come on! It's the right thing to do! Everyone's depending on us.
       Besides, it's good practice."
Auron: "I guess you're right."
Braska: "Well, then..."
[Just then the fiend attacks; Auron drops the sphere.]
Jecht: "There it is! Auron! Let's get 'im!"
Auron: "Right!"
[Braska shuts off the sphere.]

[Auron is shown talking to another warrior monk in Bevelle.]
Auron: "Thanks for everything, Kinoc."
Kinoc: "I know I don't need to tell you this, but guard Lord Braska well."
Auron: "That, I will. And you'll be busy, too. I heard they made you second-
       -in-command."
Kinoc: "You know that promotion was meant for you. You were always the better
       one, even until the end."
Auron: "You make it sound as if I was going to die or something. I will see
       you again."
Kinoc: "Yes."
Auron: "Well, then..."
Kinoc: "Going already? You will tell me about Zanarkand when you return, won't
       you?"
[Auron nods.]
Auron: "Farewell."
[Auron leaves and Kinoc turns off the sphere.]

VIII. Moonflow South Wharf
--------------------------

[A shot of Braska watching the Moonflow is shown. Jecht lies under a tree.]
Jecht: "What are you shooting me for?"
Auron: "So you don't do anything stupid again. I can't believe you attacked
       that shoopuf. Lord Braska had to pay the handler for damages from his
       own travel money."
Jecht: "I said I was sorry. It's never gonna happen again! I promise!"
Auron: "Ah, a promise? Which you'll forget come tomorrow!"
Braska: "Auron, please. He did apologize. He knows he was wrong."
Jecht: "That's it. Only thing I drink from now on is shoopuf milk!"
Braska: "You're sure?"
Jecht: "We're on a journey to fight Sin and save Spira, right? If I keep
       screwin' up...and...making a fool of myself...my wife and kid are never
       gonna forgive me."
Auron: "That's on the record."
[The sphere fades out.]

------------------------
IX. Thunder Plains South
------------------------

[Thunder Plains is shown. Auron plays cameraman once again.]

Jecht: "Hey! Hold it steady!"
Auron: "Why am I doing this?"
[Later, Braska is in Auron's frame.]
Auron: "What do you see there, my lord?"
Braska: "Oh, I was just...thinking."
Jecht: "This is important! No foolin' around! You're gonna spoil it!"
[Lightning flashes and hits Jecht.]
Jecht: "Whoa!"
Braska: "Are you all right?"
Auron: "Now there's a scene for posterity!"
Jecht: "Yeah, yeah..."
[Auron shuts off the camera as Braska starts to break out in laughter.]

In case you don't understand, these are the quotes for dismissing blitzers...

---

Abus  Hey, I liked being on your team. You got some moves, man.

Argai Ronso  Ronso only follow the strong. When you call, Argai will follow.

Auda Guado  I must thank you for the opportunity you have given me to learn
             more about you and your ways.

Balgerda  That was boring. Call me again if you think you can entertain me.

Basik Ronso  Next we meet, Basik will be stronger! Basik swears it on his
              horn!

Berrik  I helped you only to make up for kidnapping your summoner.

Bickson  I made the Goers what they are today. Youd best remember that.

Biggs  It was an honour playing with you! Thank you!

Blappa  Sorry for all the trouble we caused. Was that enough to earn your
         forgiveness?

Botta  So, how did I do? Hey, you wont forget me next time, ya?

Brother  Whoa! Father will be mad for leaving without telling him! But
          invite me again!

Datto  Hey, I got pretty good, ya? Lets play again sometime.

Deim  I guess this is the end, then. We will be on different sides of the
       sphere next time we meet.

Doram  You know where to find me if you want me to...play with you.

Durren  Thank you for the training, sir! Your help will not be forgotten
         when we defeat Sin!

Eigaar  I had a fun time. Call me again.

Gazna Ronso  Next time Gazna show you all that Sacred Mt. Gagazet has taught
              the Ronso.

Giera Guado  You have seen the Guados strength. Call me if you think you
              need lessons.

Graav  Playing with you wasnt as boring as Id feared...barely.

Irga Ronso  I must thank the sacred mount for bringing us together. You play
             excellent blitzball.

Isken  I beat Sins toxin and gained my life back. Im just getting better
        every time I play!

Jassu  Your team is da best, no question. Let me in again next time, ya?

Judda  Doing your best is pretty fun. Call me again sometime.

Jumal  I joined you to please my daughter, but it seems that all I could do
        was try to keep up with you.

Keepa  Ill do better next time! Im gonna practise real hard.

Kiyuri  Gee, I guess I still need some training. Ill practise out at sea
         when Im sailing.

Kulukan  Thanks for inviting me to play with you! Stop by the tavern when
          youre in Kilika, okay?

Kyou  Ah, I must return to my duties. Fight well, fellowman.

Lakkam  Maybe I kidnap you next time. Just kidding!

Larbeight  Youre a pretty good player. Say, why dont you play for us next
            season?

Letty  One day Ill be as good as you! Mark my words!

Linna  It was fun playing with people other than Al Bhed!

Mep  That was an enlightening experience. I miss my days in the pros.

Mifurey  Dodging lightning bolts it fun, but blitzball also has its appeal.
          Call me again!

Miyu  Shall I stay with the Crusaders, or retire and become a blitzer? Quite
       a dilemma.

Naida  Im sorry, I have to go back now. Rin is going to be on my case for
        ditching work!

Nav Guado  Was that the best you can do, human? Your kind will never measure
            up to us Guado.

Nedus  I hope I made myself useful. Im really the insecure type, you know.

Nimrook  You need goalie, you need me. You remember.

Nizarut  Hey, I think we made a great team, kid! Call me again when you need
          backup!

Noy Guado  Our contract has come to an end. If you have no more use of me, I
            must leave.

Nuvy Ronso  You have courage equal to that of a Ronso warrior. You are...
             worthy.

Pah Guado  I was quite entertained. See you again.

Raudy  Next time I play for you, dont give me so much work to do, huh?

Rin  I must return to my shops soon. Please honor us again with your
      patronage.

Ropp  Come to the agency next time. Drinks are on me.

Shaami  That was a great experience. I know itll help me report blitzball
         games better. Thanks!

Shuu  That was fun, but tiring! I think Ill stick to cheering for you.

Svanda  I had started to miss the quietude of the Calm Lands. But lets do
         this again sometime.

Tatts  I have more time than I know what to do with. You know where to find
        me if you need me.

Tidus  None as he cannot be dropped from the team.

Vilucha  Promise not to tell my husband and my son that Im a blitzball
          player, okay?

Vuroja  Some day, Ill be an even greater player than Ohalland ever was. And
         thats a promise, kid.

Wakka  Guess its time for me to go low-key now that Im retired, you know?

Wedge  Guess Ill go back to my old job. Someones gotta protect the stadium.

Yuma Guado  The time spent with you was exhilarating. I must tell my friends
             back home all about it.

Zalitz  I quit being a sailor because I was afraid of the sea, but I play some
         good blitzball, no?

Zamzi Ronso  Size not matter in blitzball. You proved that.

Zazi Guado  As long as youve got Gil, Im willing to play for you.

Zev Ronso  Zev has grown strong playing with you. Now Zev will grow strong
            playing against you.

S3. CACTUAR SIDEQUEST STUFFS                                             [CCTS]
_______________________________________________________________________________

Cactuar Village sidequest: 

[Approach the stone with a Cactuar engraved on it]

Narrative: Theres writing on the stone. = Song of the Gatekeeper =

Narrative: 10 little gatekeepers play in the sand. Tomays gone. Gone
           to fetch the water. Be back soon.

Narrative: 9 little gatekeepers play in the sand. Roviveas gone
           walkabout. Be back soon.

Narrative: 8 little gatekeepers play in the sand. Little Chava likes
           big numbers. Be back soon.

Narrative: 7 little gatekeepers play in the sand. Alek and Aloje
           play tag in the ruins of men. Be back soon.

Narrative: 5 little gatekeepers play in the sand. Vachella seeks the
             shining blue. Be back soon.

Narrative: 4 little gatekeepers play in the sand. O, Robeyas stuck
           inside. Be back soon.

Narrative: 3 little gatekeepers play in the sand. A fiery inscription
           -- The lord of the hole is gone, Isrra thinks. Be back soon.

Narrative: 2 little gatekeepers play in the sand. Much-curious Elio
           has left on a journey. Be back soon.

Narrative: 1 little gatekeepers play in the sand. Flaile is always
           left behind. Be back soon.

Narrative: 10 little gatekeepers play in the sand. Nobodys here.
           The sand is gone. 

Narrative: Using spheres to control the sands, the Cactuars defend
           their village. They are the Gatekeepers. Present all 10
           of the spheres they bear to the stone altar and the way
           to the village will open. 

Way of the Gatekeepers I: It may look like fun and games, but the
                          Gatekeepers are a proud race of warriors.
                          While they dislike combat, they will turn
                          and face any enemy that takes their back.

Way of the Gatekeepers II: Should you fail to sneak up on them they
                           will realize they have over-estimated
                           their enemy and depart in disgust.

Way of the Gatekeepers III: Sneak up on the Cactuars when their backs
                            are turned to confront them. Its better
                            that way, believe me.

Spheres: Fail to catch the gatekeeper unaware, and youll obtain the
         Sphere del Perdedor! Beat the gatekeeper and obtain his
         personal sphere! Collect lots of spheres to receive an award
         at the village. 

Tomay: Duties: Fetching water. Takes his time and, as a result, is
       often left behind. A little dim. 

Rovivea: Has no patience for certain dim-witted friends. Not a
         progressive thinker. 

Chava: Recently learned how to count to 50. A little needy. Attention
       defecit. 

Alek & Aloja: Two brothers, rarely separated. They move as one, their
              closeness a paragon of brotherhood. 

Vachella: Loves new things. Hard on others, easy on self. Stingy. 

Robeya: A real needle brain. Likes cramped spaces. Check out his great
        collection! 

Issra: The philosopher about town. Today he digs holes. Again. A
       cautious sort. 

Elio: To see what lies beyond the sands, he travels far to distant lands.
      Hyper-reactive and a bad poet. 

Flaile: The guy you never invite but he always shows up anyway. Cheeky. 

[Tidus sets a glowing sphere in a rock with a Cactuar on it]

[The Cactuars shape begins to glow  on the rock] 

Narrative: Writing appears when the sphere is set into the stone!

Narrative: Theres writing on the stone.

Narrative: 10 little gatekeepers play in the sand. Tomays gone.
           Gone to fetch the water. Gone for good.

Narrative: 9 little gatekeepers play in the sand. Roviveas gone
           walkabout. Gone for good.

Narrative: 8 little gatekeepers play in the sand. Little Chava likes
           big numbers. Gone for good.

Narrative: 7 little gatekeepers play in the sand. Alek and Aloje play
           tag in the ruins of men. Gone for good.

Narrative: 5 little gatekeepers play in the sand. Vachella seeks the
           shining blue. Gone for good.

Narrative: 4 little gatekeepers play in the sand. O, Robeyas stuck
           inside. Gone for good.

Narrative: 3 little gatekeepers play in the sand. A fiery inscription
           -- The lord of the hole is gone, Isrra thinks. Gone for good.

Narrative: 2 little gatekeepers play in the sand. Much-curious Elio has
           left on a journey. Gone for good.

Narrative: 1 little gatekeepers play in the sand. Flaile is always left
           behind. Gone for good.

Narrative: 10 little gatekeepers play in the sand. Nobodys here. The sand
           is gone.

_______________________________________________________________________________

Belgemine: Welcome, Yuna.

Yuna: What is this place?

Belgemine: Remiem Temple. Once a great religious center in the Calm
           Lands, lost after the battle with Sin.

Tidus: And this is your home? What, you got something against company?

Belgemine: Its a long story. Easier, perhaps, to show you?

[Pyreflies glow around her]

Tidus: Youre dead too?

Belgemine: Dont send me just yet. There is still one thing left for
           me to do here. With the help I can give, a young summoner
           might just be able to defeat Sin. Well, Yuna? 

---

[NOTE: Belgemine is the speaker, not the aeon.]

Valefor: I challenge you: if you cannot beat me, youll never beat Sin.

Ixion: Youve got quite a name to live up to, daughter of Braska.

Shiva: If youve got what it takes to beat Sin, I should be no more than
       a bump in your path, right?

Ifrit: Well, Yuna, shall we see how well your training serves you?
  
Bahamut: Well, Yuna, shall we see how well your training serves you?

Yojimbo: Well, Yuna, shall we see how well your training serves you?

Magus Sisters: Well, Yuna, shall we see how well your training serves you?

Anima: I will be the judge of your aeons strength. Are you good enough, I
       wonder?

[All above snippets have following option:]
  R1 --> Ill do my best.
  R2 --> Perhaps later. 

  R1: [List of aeons]
  R2: [Yuna doesn't fight.]

[Choose aeon]

Belgemine: Very well. Before we begin... [Heals aeons] Now, are you ready?

[If Yuna wins against opposing aeon:]

Belgemine: Stop. That is enough. Ah, you have made some progress, and for
           that I am glad. Take this. It may come in handy. [Get items] 

[After beating Magus Sisters:]

Yuna: Thank you." [bows] "Perhaps youll teach me again someday?

Belgemine: Thats not possible. You have already surpassed your father.
           There is nothing more I can teach you. My work here on Spira
           is done. Time for me to go.

Auron: Send her. 
       R1 --> Perform sending.
       R2 --> Do nothing. 

       R1: Yuna: Yes.
       R2: [Yuna doesn't do it.]

[She steps forward to send Belgemine]

Belgemine: It is in your hands. Destroy Sin, and save Spira.

[Belgemine gets sent.]
