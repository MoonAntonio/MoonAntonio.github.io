-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

This guide is for people who want to get those secret items that the enemy 
has in the EARLY part of the game. Though this method is not the fastest or 
easiest, it is by far the most guaranteed(legal) method of getting the steal 
weapon ability early. Without stealing weapons from the enemies, the other 
way to get rare items is to do the treasure hunts(map placements) properly 
or from Nono's shop(linking). You will NOT get ALL rare items from stealing, 
but you will miss MOST rare and useful items if you do not steal.

                           3. STEALING FAQs
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

This section is about frequently asked questions and answers about stealing.



1) I have steal helms, accessory ..etc....Why can't I steal the item from 
   the enemy?

Ans: It may be due to the following reasons:
     A. The enemy has Maintainance support abillty EQUIPPED.
     B. The item you are trying to steal are boots.
     C. The enemy does NOT have the item.



2) Why can't I steal EXP or JP?

Ans: In order to steal EXP or JP, the enemy must have them(EXP/JP)! You 
     can't steal EXP from an enemy who has just level up(0 EXP) to bring 
     his level down. 



3) Why can't I steal boots? I have steal accessory ability!

Ans: Boots are not considered as accessory, but armlets are! Therefore you 
     can steal genji armlets, but not feather shoes. To get those rare,
     powerful shoes(e.g.Galmia shoes) you have to do the treasure hunts
     (map placement) properly or from linking.



4) What are the weapons needed to learn to abilities steal weapon and steal 
   ability?

Ans: For steal weapon you need to have sword breaker and for steal ability 
     you need Cinqueda.


 
5) When/where can I get Sword breaker?

Ans: Sword breaker are missions with random rewards of TYPE 6, so you will 
     not get it until late in the game. Another way is to steal the sword 
     breaker from enemy thieves, but in order to do that you need steal 
     weapon ability so it's kind of pointless..



6) When/where can I get Cinqueda?

Ans: Cinqueda is a reward for reaching clan negiotiate skill lv 30. Another 
     way is to steal it from enemy thieves who has it.


 
7) How do I improve my stealing rate?

Ans: There are a number of ways to improve your stealing rate:
     a. Equip Thief armlets(improve stealing rate by 20%)
     b. Cast sleep or stop on enemies, steal rate would be 100% on them.
     c. Steal from the enemies side or back.
     d. Equip with Concentrate support ability
     e. Blinding Enemies will improve your chances by around 5-10%
     f. Tip from Xenast : Slowing targets down gives you more tries at 
        stealing the items/abilities.



8) How do I steal hidden weapons?

Ans: Just KEEP ON stealing weapons from them until you get the hidden 
     items. Do not cast sleep or stop on the enemy that has a hidden 
     item as they need to re-equip their weapons(You can steal the 
     hidden item only if they re-equip it with them!).
     
     Tip: If you have 2 or more members with stealing skills, you might
          want to HASTE the target, so that they will re-equip their
          weapons faster. 



9) I used Sensor/Mog Peek with 100% rate, why is nothing detected?

Ans: Only those enemies who can re-equip themselves will have hidden 
     items detected. I.E. Those enemies with Item skill as their secondary
     A-ability has hidden items. Use Sensor/Mog Peek to find out what are 
     the hidden items. You DO NOT have to use Sensor/Mog Peek first in
     order to steal hidden items.


 		 	
10) Can I steal blue mage abilities from monsters, other blue mages and 
    morphers?

Ans: No. You cannot steal blue mage abilities from monster, other blue 
     mages and morphers.



11) I can't steal the ability that I want(i.e. 0%). What's wrong?

Ans: This could be due to the following reasons:
     a. You already have the ability.
     b. You are trying to steal Reaction or support abilites.(you can only 
        steal Action(A) - abilites.
     b. Your race can't become that particular class, thus you can't steal 
        it's ability(e.g. A Human trying to steal abilities from assassin
        a viera-only class).
     c. You are trying to steal an ability that the enemy has not mastered.
     d. You are trying to steal blue mages, monsters and morpher abilities.
     e. The enemy has NO more abilities for stealing.



12) I want more of the rare items or abilities. Is there a way to STEAL 
    more??

Ans: Yes. You can try stealing the rare items/abilities, then FLEE from 
     the mission. You will fail that mission, but it will come back again. 
     So you can repeat stealing the rare items. But this method can only be 
     applied to battle missions that you can FLEE from. 



13) Ritz/Shara has one of the cool items that I want! But I cannot steal it. 
    Why?

Ans: She is considered as your ally. You cannot perform steal on your own
     team mate.

                 4. HOW TO GET STEAL WEAPON ABILITY EARLY!
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Firstly, to use this method you have to be quite early in the game(before 
Main mission 9, magic wood). I would not recommend this method too early in 
the game as there will not be enough quests for you to raise your clan 
negiotiate skill quick enough. In order to get some of the rare items, you 
need to hold off some missions before getting steal weapon ability. Finally, 
you are trying to get steal weapon ability, NOT sword breaker!


Steps
-----


1. Sign up for the following Missions(pay fee), but DO NOT do them until 
   you get steal weapon ability!!!

   a. Frosty Mage
   b. Nubswood base
   c. Magic Wood(main quest 9) 
 
 

2. You need to get the steal weapon ability from the thief in the wanted! 
   quest(Diaghilev Godeye, quest no. 27). The quest will appear after you 
   have done Thesis Hunt main quest. Sign up for the mission(pay fee), but 
   don't do it until you get Cinqueda(For steal ability). There is an
   alternative location where you can get steal weapon ability. See section
   4. RARE/HIDDEN ITEMS LOCATION.



3. After you completed the main mission 8(Hot Awakening), it time to do 
   SOME clan level up! Go to the pub and do ALL the dispatch/battle 
   missions you can do. Then REPEAT the following quests in order to raise 
   your clan skills(most importantly negiotiate skill):

   a. Swords in cyril
   b. Metal Hunt
   c. Chocobo help
   d. Materite
   e. Missions with flags icons...
   f. Other Possible missions...

   You are repeating the missions in order to reach clan negiotiate skill 
   30, so that you can get Cinqueda. It will take a quite while(I did it in 
   26+ hours of game time). So at the same time you can level up your 
   characters and learn the abilities and unlock the jobs that you want to 
   get(assassin, ninja, illusionist..etc..). Rememeber at the same time to 
   learn ALL the steal abilities.

   
   From Andrew Pellerano:

   "There is a much easier way to reach negotiation level 30 at the beginning 
    of the game.  
    
    1. Do just the first couple of major quests so that you can activate the 
       clan command and random battles.  
    
    2. Immediately ditch your second human in the party (he’s the most useless 
       early game) so that you have 5 members total in your clan.  
    
    3. Get into a random battle and flee as soon as you can. When you check 
       the missions list at the pub, you’ll notice a (tribe) Wanted mission 
       posted by Montblanc where (tribe) is the race aligned with the current 
       month.  
    
    4. Send someone out on this dispatch mission (they take 5 days) and when 
       they return you’ll gain experience towards your negotiation skill. 

    5. Say no to the new member who wants to join; yes, you’re going to make 
       a lot of people cry. Run around the map until it is the beginning of 
       a new month. 
    
    6. Head into the pub and you’ll see you now have 2 (tribe) Wanted missions: 
       one aligned with last month and one aligned with the current month.
       Note that if you accidentally invite a member to your clan, you’ll miss 
       out on the second quest generated by the previous month. 
       You may need to get into a random battle and start the process over 
       from there. Every 3 or 4 of these dispatch quests will net you a level 
       in negotiation."
   
   Using the above steps will allow you to reach negiotiation skill level 30 in 
   about 6 hours(varies).



4. The missions will reappear in different months of the game. So just walk 
   around on the map and visit pubs to see if the quests reappears. Also, 
   to get Missions with flags icons(turf missions), when your turf is under 
   attack, DO NOT go to rescue it!!! Wait till its captured and the turf 
   missions will appear in the pubs and you can do them again for clan 
   skill points. If there are multiple turfs being captured, only one 
   mission will show in the pub. You can only do 1 turf(dispatch) mission 
   at a time.



5. If you find that you have too much useless mission items(adamanite, 
   materite, chocobo eggs..) you can discard them. The missions with those 
   items as rewards will reappear. DO NOT THROW AWAY OTHER MISSION ITEMS 
   BESIDES THE THREE LISTED ABOVE!!!!



6. Once you reached negiotiate skill 30, you will get Cinqueda. Now it's 
   time to get steal weapon ability!! Equip your thief with the cinqueda 
   and do the wanted! quest(Diaghilev Godeye, quest no. 27). Steal the 
   steal weapon ability from the thief of that quest, before killing him.



NOW YOU HAVE STEAL WEAPON ABILITY EARLY!!!

                        5. RARE/HIDDEN ITEMS LOCATIONS
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=


Now that you have ALL the stealing abilities you can get, its time to get 
those great items you have been working hard for. I will only list out 
missions with IMPORTANT items to steal, as most of the other items can be 
bought from shops or gotten from treasure hunts and linking. The list is 
arranged in the way that I did the missions. That means after Frosty Mage, 
I do Nubswood base, then Magic Wood and so on...

                         that you can learn from the item will be in
