Condensed Lore Guide 3.5

By Skoobouy <skoobouy at hotmail dot com>

Compiled and useful
for Final Fantasy III for the Super the Super Nintendo
or Final Fantasy IV for the Sony Playstation.


*** Introduction

Strago comes within a hair's breadth of not being cool. Thankfully, he has a 
few saving graces, like Pearl Wind, L.? Pearl, Aero, Big Guard, Aqua Rake, 
Quasar and GrandTrain. However, the quest to collect all of Strago's Lores is 
an end in itself, rather than actually being useful. This guide should help 
you get all of the Lores in the fastest time, and save you a lot of paper to
boot ('cuz I'm just efficient like that, yo).


*** Revision History

3.5, March 5th, '05 -    Added the Chart of Lores by Skill (kick ass, IMO), as
                         well as a dozen of Assassin's "ninja-star" corrections
                         (as in, small but deadly)
3.4, March 3rd, '05 -    Various corrections and additions. (Thanks to
                         Assassin's super-human editting skills).
3.3, March 1st, '05 -    Revived Lore material as a separate guide (hence the
                         new version number). Made several corrections based
                         on Assassin's advice.
3.2, February 1st, '05 - Removed all Lore material. Cleaner, nicer guide to
                         Rage.
3.1, January 31st, '05 - Added information on some Rages and modified
                         formatting and rewrote some paragraphs.
3.0, January 30th, '05 - It returns! I FINALLY filled in the status effects of
                         Rages, and redid the tables. Also, modified 
                         formatting, and other minor changes.
2.5.5, May 5th, '03 -    I skipped a number. Rewrote the Lores guide and chart.
                         Made lots of minor corrections.
2.3, April 25th, '03 -   More niceties, rearranged the order of the guide.
2.2, April 24th, '03 -   Added to Rage skill descriptions, and a brief 
                         explanation of column titles, and changed Gau's
                         "Minimum of Fuss" guide.
2.1, April 22nd, '03 -   Filled in gaps, corrected some mistakes.
2.0, April 20th, '03 -   Complete rewrite, added Strago section.
1.0, April 9th, '03 -    Added to "Important Rages" section, updated
                         Introduction, and modified Strategy section.
0.9, April 8th, '03 –    Microsoft Word version.
0.8, April 7th, '03 -    The first draft! Lists Rages in a few ways; not easy
                         to read and not convenient to print.

I. All of the Lores with a Minimum of Fuss Walkthrough

Once you have control of Strago, you're already at the end of the World of 
Balance. That means that you can get gobs of Lores right away. The following
guide is a barebones step-by-step guide that should allow you to have collect
each of the Lores in each "World" within just a few minutes. How's that for
efficiency?


A. WORLD OF BALANCE

Lores to Collect:
Aqua Rake   Stone       Revenge     Exploder    Pearl Wind
Condemned   Pep Up      Step Mine   Dischord    L.3 Muddle
L.4 Flare   L.5 Doom    Roulette    Blow Fish

Strago begins with Aqua Rake, Stone, and Revenge. In the burning house in 
Thamasa, cast a fire spell on a Balloon and it might cast Exploder. Go to 
Esper Mountain and fight an Abolisher. Give it three turns, and you have Pearl 
Wind.

When you have control of your whole party, retrieve Gau and have him use 
Zombone|Condemned and Intangir|Pep Up for those Lores. Then fly to South Figaro
and muddle a Greasemonk for Step Mine.

Now, go to the Veldt. Fight a Telstar for ten turns, and you will have 
Dischord. Sit down with a few Trappers to learn all of L.3 Muddle, L.4 Flare, 
and L.5 Doom. With Relm, sketch a Pipsqueak for Roulette.

Finally, on the Floating Continent, battle some Brainpans and slaughter all 
but one. It will use Blow Fish.


B. WORLD OF RUIN

Lores to Collect:
Big Guard   Rippler     Aero        Sour Mouth  CleanSweep
L.? Pearl   GrandTrain  Quasar      Reflect???  ForceField

Most of these Lores are easy. After you use Relm to rescue Strago, Sketch an 
EarthGuard for Big Guard. Then zip over to the land outside Maranda and fight a 
Reach Frog or two for Rippler. Fly to Kohlingen and fight a Harpiai for Aero, 
then run into Daryl's Tomb to learn Sour Mouth from a Mad Oscar. Burrow down 
to the Ancient Castle, where an Enuo will use CleanSweep when you kill its 
buddies.

L.? Pearl gives you a couple of options. If you haven't done the Phoenix Cave, 
I recommend going there and letting Relm Sketch the Red Dragon. Otherwise, 
take Strago into Cyan's Dream and fight some Critics. If both events are gone, 
you can muck about for Critics in the Veldt, or fight Innoc in Kefka's Tower. 
I suggest the former.

For GrandTrain, go complete Strago's side quest, and make sure to kill all the 
little Hidonites first - then you're in business. Dark Force has a one-in-
three chance, every seven turns of casting Quasar and Reflect???, so be
patient. Sadly, the only way to learn ForceField is to kill Doom - the first
statue.

II. Chart of Lores by Monster Order of Appearance

This chart is very simple. It is organized in rough chronological order by 
monster. However, there are many variables which I will describe in the 
'Situation' column for each monster's Lore skill. They are as follows:f


KEY:

R - Obtain Lore by 'R'age.
S - Obtain Lore by 'S'ketch.
C - Obtain Lore by 'C'ontrol (or Muddle or Gau's Rage, "Nightshade|Charm").
B - Obtain Lore by 'B'attle--no special strategy necessary.
N - Obtain Lore by a special battle strategy. See 'N'otes (below).
V - One-time-only monster; look for it on the 'V'eldt.
! - Best/earliest monster to learn from.

III. Chart of Lores by Skill

What would a Lore guide be without a chart of the Lores themselves? Here they
are in all their alphabetical glory. Pay close attention to the KEY if you want
to have any idea what the heck's going on. I had to do a lot of funky things to
save space, but look ma: no footnotes! This is one of the densest charts I've
ever done; I'll tackle anyone who don't appreciate it!


KEY:

MP -  Magic Points necessary to cast the spell.
Pwr - Power; Non-damage-dealing spells and spells whose "Pwr" does not reflect
      their actual strength are n/a.
Hit - Hit Rate; unblockable skills are n/a.
El -  Element of attack, as follows:
      f - Fire            p - Poison          e - Earth
      i - Ice             a - Air/Wind        w - Water
      b - Bolt/Lightning  h - Holy/Pearl      - - Non-elemental or n/a

I -   Ignores Defense; sometimes means that a skill is very powerful, but
      sometimes refers to healing or to a special mode of damage
      calculation. Non-damage-dealing spells are n/a ("/").
U -   Unblockable; these skills won't miss except in cases of enemy immunity.
      Untargetted spells are n/a ("/").
N -   No Split Damage; these spells do not become less effective when cast on
      multiple enemies at once. Single target and non-damage-dealing spells are
      n/a ("/").

Unless stated otherwise, all Lores target one enemy.

APPENDIX: On Dark Force

Dark Force is an enemy in Kefka's Tower that uses 19 of Strago's 24 Lores, 
*excluding* Big Guard, CleanSweep, ForceField, Pep Up, and GrandTrain (but he 
can still teach CleanSweep using Rage, Sketch, or Control). He has a cycle of 
seven turns, each of which selects randomly from a pool of three skills. 
Launcher and Imp Song, sadly, are not Lores. Here is the Dark Force battle 
script, dumped from Lord J's FF3usME:

Turn           Chooses from one of these thre
