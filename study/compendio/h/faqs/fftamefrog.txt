Hey everybody. My name is me frog, and I've written a lot of FAQs for
GameFAQs. Most of them have been in-depth FAQs, and this is my first RPG
and Final Fantasy FAQ. After a long while, Square has come back to
Nintendo!

This guide, while it seems short, will actually finish as a very large
guide. There aren't many chapters, but the important ones cover many,
many aspects of the game. The GAME INFORMATION section will tell you the
game data, the story, the races, the people you meet, the types of
gameplay, and many more small things. The CONTROLS section will tell you
all the controls during battle, a menu, gameplay, and misc. The
WALKTHROUGH will help you how to get through the game, as well as
telling you how to beat all 300 missions. The CONTACT section will
explain how I can be reached, and what you can and can't send me. The
CREDITS/LEGAL section will complement the people worth mentioning here,
and the legal information about what you can do with this guide.

The two big sections are the GAME INFORMATION and the WALKTHROUGH
section. Because they are so big, it can be difficult finding things.
That's why I suggest you use your computers FIND option to jump straight
to the thing you need. Say for example, you need to find information on
mission 106. Just type in MISSION 106 and you are right there! Remember
if I have not covered a mission/game aspect, you will not be able to
find anything.

STORY:
*****
This story is about a boy named Marche who moves to a town called St.
Ivalice. He has had a bad past, and he tries to adjust to his new life.
He makes two new friends: Mewt, who is a mature boy, although picked on
a lot, and Ritz, a student who has a strong-willed nature which has made
her an unpopular girl at school. They call themselves friends, even
though they know nothing about each other. One day, Marche and his
friends discover a strange book. When they opened it, their town changed
completely. Mewt and Ritz and Marche all enjoy the new place, but they
are unsure whether they want to go back to their old town or live in
their new one...

THE MAGIC BOOK

NOTE: This section was taken from the back of the Final Fantasy Tactics Advance
      Instruction Booklet.

Long before Noah built his ark, there were tales of an ancient land named
Kiltia, which is a world where swords and sorcery reigned. Its learning
and power were swept away in the great flood, but one clue to its
secrets remained: an ancient book known as the Gran Grimoire, hidden in
darkness by the powers that once were. It is not certain how many copies
of the book still exist, but it is said that whoever should hold one
holds the power to change the world. Many lived out their days searching
the world for surviving copies, but none were ever found. It was an
illusion, they said. A myth... but one worth dying for.

**********
CHARACTERS
**********

MARCHE RADIUJU
Marche is the main character in Final Fantasy TA. The game starts right after
he moves in to St. Ivalice. They left their old home because Marche's
parent's divorce finally settled after years so they were forced to leave
their home. Also, Marche's little brother, Doned, has an illness he was born
with and it became worse. Everyone though moving to the country would help it.
Marche must master the art of war if he ever wants to change Ivalice back to
the way it was...

MEWT RANDELL
Mewt is another main character in the game. He is very shy and odd, and he
always carries a teddy bear given to him by his mother. His shyness and
strangeness has led to him be picked on by bullies at school. When Mewt's
mother died, his father lost all confidence and started having some
difficulties at work, and the passing of his mother and the results of his
father's poor work has only caused Mewt to get even shyer. Mewt is the one who
discovered the strange book and everything changed when he opened it...

RITZ MALBEUR
The classmate of Marche and Mewt. Ritz is tough and outspoken, unlike Marche
and Mewt, and she is very smart and athletic. He spirit and sense of right and
wrong has caused her to become very unpopular at school though. Ritz also has
a secret... a secret that bothers her more than anything else in the world.
Marche cannot find Ritz when Ivalice is transformed...

MONTBLANC
A moogle boy who saves Marche. When Marche first arrives in the transformed
Ivalice, he gets into a bad situation with a bagnaa, and Montblanc comes to
his rescue. He helps him around Ivalice and shows Marche his clan, which he
lets Marche join. Montblanc is a very good companion and friend to Marche...

BABUS
Babus is Mewt's attendant who swears to protect Mewt. He and Marche run into
each other quite a bit over the course of the game, but then Babus changes his
ways during the end...

JUDGEMASTER CID
Father of Mewt, Cid lost all hope when his wife died. In the land of Ivalice,
however, he is the Judgemaster, and is a good father to Mewt. He is against
Marche, but when he and Marche witness something very odd, Cid's opinion's about
Marche change... but are they positive opinions, or negatives?

LLEDNAR
You'll be introduced to Llednar about a third into the main storyline, and meet
him and two-thirds in. Llednar seems to be invincible, and his past is hidden.
Who is he? Only three others know...

QUEEN REMDI
Remdi Randell died in the real world, but in the land of Ivalice, she is the
queen. Mewt calls to her whenever he is upset, and she'll always comfort her.
She opposes anyone who does something against Mewt, and that gives her negative
feelings to Marche and his friends...

NONO
Montblanc's little brother, Nono got is Airship wrecked by an evil clan. When
Marche gets Nono's airship back, he turns it into a merchant ship for trading
goods.

SHARA
Ritz's friend. Like Montblanc helped Marche, Shara helped Ritz when she arrived
in the land of Ivalice. She is a veria who is kind to Marche, although she'll go
along with whatever Ritz does.

EZEL
Ezel is a brilliant Nu Mou who invents the law and antilaw cards, which become
of a great service to you. After you get Ezel out of a tight situation, you will
be able to visit his secret shop of cards. Ezel plays an important part in
Marche's plan to change back Ivalice.


**********
RACES/JOBS
**********

HUMAN RACE: Most common race found in the city of Ivalice. Their stats
are well balanced, and they have a lot of jobs that you can choose from.
HUMAN JOBS: Soldier, Thief, White Mage, Black Mage, Hunter, Blue Mage,
Archer, Illusionist, Fighter, Palidin, Ninja

VIERA: These long-eared girls are hunters with very good hearing. They
are fast, and they can also handle monsters that are summoned. They have
good agility, and that is what their jobs are based on.
VIERA JOBS: Archer, Fencer, White Mage, Summoner, Assasin, Sniper, Red
Mage, Elementalist

MOOGLES: Moogles are somewhat of a combination of a fairy and a bunny.
They are small and their jobs are based on their special talents which are...
MOGGLE JOBS: Thief, Black Mage, Time Mage, Animist, Gadgetter, Mog knight,

NU MOU: Nu Mous look like elders with long ears and a tail. They are respected
by everybody, and because they don't enjoy fighting, their jobs are based on
the
arts of magic.
NU MOU JOBS: Beastmaster, Morpher, Alchemist, Sage, White Mage, Black Mage,
Illusionist, Time Mage

BANGAA: While they look like lizards, calling them that offends them. They

choice in a touch battle.
BANGAA JOBS: White Monk, Warrior, Gladiator, Defender, Templar, Bishop,
Dragoon.

********
MISSIONS
********

Missions are pretty much the main point of the game. You can find 300
missions,
and this guide will tell you how to defeat all of them. But what are they, and
how do you do them? There are four types of missions: Regular, Encounter,
Free-
Area, and Non-battle.

REGULAR missions are marked with a little sword and you mostly go through a
little area/dungeon/etc. and then fight a "boss" battle at the end of them.
These missions are really the game's core, since it allows the story to
proceed.

ENCOUNTER missions are marked with a little blue enemy. The majority of these
involve battles although you can sometimes avoid one.

FREE-AREA missions with a little white flag and usually don't have battle.
They
require you to go to a certain place or area or to deploy a unit.

NON-BATTLE missions have a little white scroll and they require you to send
out
a
unit on a mission. Once the mission is completed, the unit will report back.
If
a certain unit was sent under certain mission requirements, the mission might
fail. When you send out a unit, you may not have them join you in other
missions/battles/etc.

To receive a mission, go to the pubs across Ivalice. Go to the pubmaster and
select "missions" and you'll bring up a list of missions you can do. When you
select a mission, you must pay an information fee. REMEMBER: If you ignore a
mission for a while, it'll be classified as a fail. When you complete a
mission,
you can earn gil, items, and exp.

********************
UNITS AND THEIR JOBS
********************

Completing a mission can get you a new unit, although it doesn't get you one
every time. You can choose to accept or not accept the unit. Accept them and
they'll join your clan. Rejecting them means they'll leave.

The races and jobs of a unit are random every time, and their is no trick I
have
discovered for getting a new one. To also get a new unit that isn't random,
you
must complete a SPECIFIC battle or mission that usually has to do with the
game's story. If a unit has good jobs, it is a good idea to choose them while
if
you have multiple units of that race or the unit has some bad jobs, I suggest
not selecting them. You are allowed to have up to _24_ units.

JOBS
Each unit has jobs that have their own unique abilities and different
abilities
that the unit can learn. It is a little like the Class system in Golden Sun.
You
can change your job in the menu whenever you want and only certain jobs are
available when you first receive a unit. To learn a new job you must have the
required equipment.

***************
LAWS OF IVALICE
***************

There are laws of combat in Ivalice (you'll learn about them after your first
battle) that you must obey or risk being sent to jail. Laws are different each
day and you should follow them closely or you might have to force out some gil
to restore a unit sent to jail.

There is a JUDGE that watches each battle and hands out RED and YELLOW cards
to
your units if you break a law. The YELLOW cards aren't as bad as the red ones.
If you break a law to help yourself or damage an enemy, you'll receive a
yellow
card from the judge. Yellow cards lower stats and to release them, you must go
to
a prison, pay to have your unit LOCKED UP, fight a few battles, and then your
unit will not have the card. RED cards are a pain. If you break the law a
couple
of times or if you KO an enemy by breaking the law, the judge will give a red
card to you and the unit will be sent to jail. If MARCHE is locked up, your
whole unit will have to wait for him, and this can cause problems because you
can miss certain important things.

PRISON
Prison is where your units are sent when you are locked up. There are three
options in prison:

RELEASE: You must pay a VERY LARGE amount of gil to release a unit locked up. I
suggest you do this with every unit because you'll want them all for big
battles.

PARDON: You can get your units a pardon. This means you pay for them to be
locked up if they have a yellow card and then you'll have to wait several days
or fight several battles before they have their card removed.

LEAVE: You can leave the prison.

***********
LEVELING UP
***********
Leveling up plays a big part in the game. Every time you hit an enemy, you'll
gain a certain amount of experience points. When you hit a certain number, the
words "Level Up!" will appear above your character. Leveling up increases all of
your characers statistics. If you don't level up, you won't be able to progress
throughout the game. The max level you can go to is 50.

><><><><><><><>
LEVEL UP TRICK!
><><><><><><><>

There is a useful trick to leveling up. First go to the store and buy 99
potions. It should cost you around 4000 gil. Then get into a clan battle. Use a
potion on yourself every turn. It will prevent you from dying during the battle,
and you get ten experience points each time! You can gain quite a few levels a
battle using this method.

*****
CLANS
*****

A Clan is basically an army made up of units. You can have up to 24 units in
your clan, but the max you can bring out into battle is six. At anytime you can
have a clan member leave, but you cannot let Marche or Montblanc leave. I
suggest using them, since they can grow to be very powerful. Once you clear
mission two (Thesis Hunt), you can do clan wars. On the world map, as you walk
around, you'll start to see units appearing on the map. The units will walk
around and remian on the map for a specific number of days. At the end of a
specific number, they'll leave. Meeting these units mean you'll fight a battle,
just like normal. You can gain experience, gil, AP, items, and cards this way.

***************************
IMPORTANT PLACES IN IVALICE
***************************

=-=-
PUBS
-=-=
This is a VERY important place, because it is where you receive missions. You
can do the following:

RUMORS: Listen to the rumors flying around Ivalice. Pay attention to this,
because new rumors can be spread sometimes!

MISSIONS: Here is where you select a mission from the available ones. The
mission count is 300.

QUIT MISSION: You can quit a mission that is in progress by selecting this
option.

LEAVE: You can leave the pub.

=-=-=-
PRISON-=-=-=

You can release your units here. See the PRISON section for more information.

=-=-=-=-=-=-
MONSTER BANK
-=-=-=-=-=-=
The monsters that you capture with the ability "Capture" are sent here. You
can raise some monsters at the bank.

=-=-=
SHOPS
-=-=-
The shops are useful for buying equipment and items needed throughout your
adventure. All things here cost gil, and I suggest you save some gil for
emergencies.

=-=-=-=-=-=
CARD KEEPER
-=-=-=-=-=-
You can trade "law cards" here to put laws out, or to make some laws null and
void. Some cards are better than others, a require a lot of cards to be traded
for them.

*******
BATTLES
*******
Battles are the main thing in the game. You'll fight TONS of them in Final
Fantasy and it's good to know what to do when you get in one.

Step one: Choose your units. Use the control pad to cycle through the
available units and then press the A button when you have chosen one you like
to place it onto the battle arena. You may place your unit in any place that
is blue. You'll then choose which direction you want it to face. You can
choose north, south, east, or west. The max number of units allowed depends on
where you are.

Step two: Fight. First, you'll see what you need to do to meet the conditions
of the battle. Usually it is "Defeat all enemies" but it can vary with each
battle. Who goes first depends on the speed stats of a unit. The unit with the
highest speed will go first, the unit with the second-highest takes the next
turn, etc. If all your unit's HP depletes to zero, you will lose the battle.
However, if the enemy's HP depletes to  zero, you win!

***************
STAT CONDITIONS
***************
I will describe the stat conditions in alphabetical order.

ADDLE: Unit can't do any actions except for Fight.
CURE: The spell Dispel

BERSERK: Unit will go on a rage and fight without you making any commands.

CURE: Echo grass or magic

SLEEP: Unit cannot do any action.

*************
ABBRIVIATIONS
*************
I've gotten several e-mails asking what certrain two letter abbriviations stand
for, so I've decided to put in this section.

HP
Hit points. The number of hit points you have increases with every level you
gain. You lose hit points (not for good) by getting hit by a damaging attack. It
varies how much HP you lose depending on the defense of your unit and attack of
your enemy. If your unit's HP hits zero, then it will be knocked out and will be
unable to do ANYTHING. If all of your units lose their HP, the game ends. Some
spells can restore HP, like Cure. There are also items like potions that can
restore your HP. You can use certain items and spells to revive your character
like Pheonix Down, which revives your unit and gives half of its HP back. When a
units' HP gets low, it'll kneel down. That is a signal for you to heal that unit
if you want it to stay in the battle for a long time.

MP
Magic power. The majority of your special techniques require you to use magic
power. Depending on what job and level your unit starts out with, your unit will
have differnt amounts of MP. There are certain attacks that drain MP instead of
HP, but you can restore that lost MP with items and special moves. Each time you
select a technique, it'll show the amount of MP it costs to use it. If you do
it, you'll lose that much HP (for example, the Ninja move Oblivion requires 24
magic power points. So if you don't have 24 MP, you won't be able to use
Oblivion). Once your MP hits zero, you won't be able to use any techiques.

EXP
Experience. Anyone who has played any other Final Fantasy, or basically any
other RPG, knows that experience points are vital to your units' success. Each
time you attack an enemy a bar at the top of you Game Boy Advance will say
something like 20 EXP earned! although the number varies depending on the
difference between your level and the enemies' level. When your experience
points hit 100, you gain a level. Gaining levels will raise all of your stats,
and depending on what job you are currently at, the stats raising will differ.
The maximum level is 50. There is a special move that thieves learn which can
steal EXP from an enemy, in addition to gaining experience for just using the
move. You can also gain experience from using items.

JP
Judge Points are also important. You'll want to save up as many as possible
because you can then summon powerful monsters. You get judge points from three
different ways. One, you KO an enemy, which gives you one judge point. Two, you
use a recommended ability (the recommended abilities for the day can be found
next to the laws of the day) which nets you one judge point. And three, you use
the move Steal JP, which a thief can learn. You can use these judge points to do
combos and summon totemas. To be able to do a combo, you must first master it.
Mythril weapons will give you the combo ability. Combos cost one judge point. To
use totemas, you must get to a certain point in the game, and also have ten
judge points. Then you can select the option "totema" and you'll use one.
Totemas can bring hell to your enemies, but they are expensive so save them for
really tough battles.

I'll add more as I get more info on things.

This guide will explain all cinemas as they appear. Some of the cinemas have

SPOILER NOTE! SPOILER NOTE! SPOILER NOTE!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SNOWBALL FIGHT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The game begins as Mewt is being picked on by bullies. Ritz comes to his
rescue. She'll then ask you your name and you'll have to enter your name here.
The default is Marche but you can edit it any way you like. The teacher appears
after that and explains you're about to have a snowball fight. There is now an
explanation on how the battle rules work and all the options you can do.
Listen to this, and listen again if needed. After that you'll begin the fight.
It is really simple. About halfway through, you'll be stopped by the teacher and
learn another lesson. At the end, the kids will get in a fight, and the battle
will end.

You'll now go through a long series of cinema scenes. Marche, Mewt, and Ritz
will talk a while and you'll then meet a new character: Mewt's dad. Suddenly
Mewt will mention an old book he found at the bookstore. He invites you to
come and pick it up with him. After some more talking in which you invite them
to come over to your house later, you find yourself back home. Here, you'll meet
a new character, Marche's brother. You'll talk for a while and Mewt and Ritz
will arrive. The four of you will gather around the book and open it. Overnight
you'll find that Ivalice has transformed into a strange world!

You'll find yourself in the middle of a town. You'll wonder where you are and
then you'll spot a Bagnaa. You'll be startled by him and then call him a
lizard by mistake. He'll get angry at you when suddenly, a chief character named
Montblanc (who is a Moogle) will come to your rescue. You'll start to walk
away when suddenly the Bagnaa will challenge you to a battle. A strange man will
appear and you'll begin.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
YOUR FIRST BATTLE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Your first fight is a two on two battle. You'll face two Bagnaas and it'll be
you and Montblanc working together. This battle is basically another tutorial,
except you'll earn experience points here. Just use your sword from the back and
the side to cause a lot of damage. You'll learn here about the judges and the
laws of Ivalice. Montblanc will do a lot of damage here, so you usually just
have to deal with the finishing blow. Once you have felled both enemies, the
battle will end and you'll gain a judge point, which can be used later for
combos.

After you win, the Bagnaa will use a potion to heal himself. The judge will see
this, and hand him a red card. He will be instantly warped to jail and there
will be another explanation about prison. After that Montblanc will introduce to
you his clan and then he'll let you join it. Your clan now consists of you,
Montblanc, another human, a Viera, a Nu Mou, and a Bagnaa. You'll now get
another explanation about symbols, and then your map will be marked with the
location named Sprohm.

You can now explore freely and play around with the menus. I suggest first
hearing all the rumors (ALWAYS a good thing. Do it whenever you get the
chance) and then going to the shops. Buy some good equipment for your clan but
save some money for later. When you're done doing all of that, head to the pub.
You are about to do your first mission! Select the only mission available and
pay 300 gil for it and then _SAVE_! YOU'LL WANT TO DO THAT BEFORE _EVERY_
MISSION! Finally, you will begin "Herb Picking."

First, before you begin, check the laws. If your clan has anything forbidden,
get rid of it! After that, you're ready to fight! The Sprite is a weak enemy,
so send out a strong unit (like the Bagnaa) to attack it. After it is dead,
focus your attention on the goblins. Attack them all, one after the other, until
they are dead. Now turn you attention onto the Red Cap. It is strong, so use
some powerful moves to defeat him. Once you finish the battle, the mission is
clear!

Now you must choose to place a new thing on the map: Lutia Pass. After that,
go back to the pub in Cyril. You'll find that a couple of new missions are

First, make sure you have a White Mage in your clan, so you can heal. Then,
get ready to battle! Take out the White Mage first, since it can heal, and
then used your Bagnaa to take out the soldiers, because they have strong
attacks. Attack the thieves from a distance, since they have counter.
Remember, DON'T focus your attacks on any enemy until you have defeated the
White Mage!

Now you can place Nubswood on the back. When that is done, go back to the pub

them. Bring in a White Mage just in case you need it, and take a bagnaa in and
an Archer. Take out the White Monk first, and then follow Ritz's lead as they
attack enemies. Follow this and the foes will be a breeze.

After, you and Ritz will talk a while and she'll say she doesn't want to go
back to the old world. Marche does though. The two will split again and you'll
get to place another area on the map: Elut Sands

When you go to Cyril, you'll see a cinema scene. Montblanc will ask Marche
what's on his mind, and Marche will respond by saying he was just thinking
about the next mission. They talk for a while and then suddenly Marche mentions
Ritz. He says he was sure he could find a way home with her, but he was
wrong. They'll talk for a little more and Montblanc will comfort Kupo. Then
you'll return to the world map.

This is gonna be a tough battle if you haven't raised your units to at least
level 6... You will also have wanted to pick up lots of Hi-Potions and
Phoenix Downs. You'll want to bring out a Black Mage, a White Mage, an Archer,
and the rest is your choice... just make sure they are level 6 or higher! If
not, lose and then train some more with clans. You'll want to go for Smagur
first, since he is a tough one and it'll be good to get him out of the way. Be
careful though! His defense is HIGH so you'll want to use some combos. If you
haven't been to the shop lately, some good things should be available so drop
by. You can also use Blizzard from Montblanc. It'll guarantee around 30 damage.
Now focus on Chantiko.

Focus only on Qusjil with Christine, but keep your
distance! You do not want poison. The two Red Panthers are a little easier, but
they are still very strong.  Use your best attacks on them to defeat them. Have
patience this may take you a couple of tries.

Afterward, Marche and Montblanc will talk about how the monsters went crazy.
Montlblanc will suggest crystals and they'll talk about that a bit. Now you'll

BEFORE MISSION...

You'll view a cinema first. Marche will talk about how the river seems normal,
and suddenly he'll be warped into a strange room. He'll talk a little more and
then he'll see a, you guessed it, crystal! A wrinkle in space! He'll get very
excited and then start to walk away, when suddenly a strange voice shouts to
him. A huge being will come out of the crystal and talk to him again. His name
turns out to be Famfrit, wielder of the power. He'll guess that you are after
the crystal and then he'll reveal that he is supposed to kill all that get
near it. He'll call upon some demon dudes and then Marche will say that this is
just like a normal engagement.

-------
Battle!
-------
You NEED an archer, black and white mage, and a strong sword wielder. Make
sure the swords or fights law isn't in effect and then you're ready! You only
need to defeat Famfrit to win, but the others can get in your way. Use your
archer to hit Famfrit from a distance, and use Marche to get in really close and
do some powerful attacks... I hope you have them! You should have gotten some
good weapons at the shop! Famfrit's attacks are really powerful. He has very
high defense and the counter attack, so lets hope your units have high defense
also! His demi attack drains half HP, but it thankfully misses a lot. If your
characters are in bad shape and you need to cure an enemy in order to cure
your unit, do so! Your units health is _very_ important! If you follow these
steps, you can eventually defeat Famfrit.
---------

MAJOR SPOILERS! MAJOR SPOILERS! MAJOR SPOILERS!
After you _finally_ beat Famfrit, we'll see a cut to Mewt and his dad. They
are in a huge room, and Mewt looks upset. Mewt will mention about the snowball
with a rock in it that was thrown at him back at school and his dad has no idea
what he is talking about. Then Mewt will say that he is a prince! He will become
very determined and then call for his mom. Mewt will say that he wants to make
laws stronger. Listen to this because it'll affect you. We'll now see Marche
again and he is talking to himself. He says that maybe if he destroys all the
crystals he'll be able to return home.
END SPOILERS!

Save and enter Cadoan.

You'll walk by two people talking about how the laws were strengthened. Marche
will continue walking and hear some more people talking about the laws.
Someone will come up and talk to Marche, saying to him that soon, laws will be
nothing but a memory. He'll overhear some more people talking about nullifying a
law. Marche will question that and then he and the other man will talk a little
more for a while. Save again if you didn't before and go back to Cadodan for an

Ezel: Hermetic lv. 10

Marche will come in at night and see the man he was talking to earlier. A
bunch of people will corner him and tell him he can't run forever. They will
yell a bit more then the lady will tell the other men to capture him. It turns
out that this guy is Ezel, and Marche says he has to save him. So the battle
begins!

------
Fight!
------
Before you actually start, check the laws! Remember that there are _TWO_ laws
a day now, which can cause problems. Anyway, choose a White and Black Mage and
an Archer for the battle. You can only bring in five in this one so choose
wisely! You're at a disadvantage here now because you start at the bottom of the
hill. Meaning you'll have to spend a turn or two climbing up if before you
actually begin to battle. Ezel will actually help you, although he is pretty
weak (or the guys or pretty strong I can't tell). Use your best sword dealers to
take out the level eight units, and the rest should just but taken out with
Montblanc and your Archer. After you strike the first blow (I think), Marche and
Ezel will talk a bit.

When it is Marche's turn, run up to the left side of Olivar and hit her. When
you can, USE FAMFRIT! He can easily take out at least two people, and make all
the others drop to their knees. Just repeat these strategies until they are all
dead. You might have to use a couple of Potions and Phoenix Downs, but nothing
more.
---------

After the battle, Ezel and Marche will take a while. Ezel will say he has to run
because some other people are chasing him. Suddenly a bunch of men will come
down riding on something (couldn't tell who it was). The main man, who turns out
to be Mewt's father, starts speaking to Ezel. Marche will be shocked at finding
out that Mewt's father is the judgemaster. Cid will ask Ezel to come with him so
that they can talk about the "antilaws". Cid will suddenly pull out a card and
it'll flash and cover Ezel. Ezel will say that that is an advanced card, and
that only the judgemaster is allowed to use them. Suddenly, Ezel will pull out
another card, and call it an "antilaw card". He will use it and him and Marche
will disappear. Cid will be surprised at learning that Ezel can stop an
advanced law and then order everyone back to the palace.

There will be a cut to Ezel and Marche at the pub, talking about the antilaw
card. Marche will be impressed and then they will talk some more about making
laws suddenly without asking the people. Ezel will then tell Marche about his
store, which is for trading law cards. THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PLACE! The
screen will blacken and the mission results screen will pop up. You will now get
to place Aisenfield onto the map. Go to a pub and select Diamond Rain.

Your characters should be around level nine or ten by now. If not, good luck on
this mission :) If one of your Bagnaas knows Air Render, USE IT because it'll
help to damage the enemies from a distance. Famfrit is also really helpful here,
because it causes massive damage. Take out the Ice Flan by using Marche's Fire,
and focus your strong attackers on the Lamia. The Ice Flan can cause some type
of major blizzard that can easily one-hit KO your units, and the two Icedrakes
are VERY powerful. Make sure your white mage can last a long time, because
you'll be using it A LOT here. Conz, the level 9 Icedrake, has Counter on him,
so try to use Black Mage powers to defeat him. The counter can do around 60
damage!

Try to use as many combos as possible, because they never miss and hit
for high damage. Also attempt to gather around three enemies close to each
other, so the Black Mages can hit all at the same time. Have patience and don't
break any laws and you'll defeat this mission.

After the battle, Marche will say that he wishes the "diamonds" were actually
crystals. Suddenly he'll see a little spark fall into the bushes. He'll walk
over and then he'll see another spark fall. He'll say they disappeared, and then
he'll say hat maybe the rain has something to do with the crystals... You not
get to place "Roda Volcano" onto the map. When you're ready, go to the pub and

Marche will walk in and mention how hot it is. He'll wonder how he'll be able to
get anything done when suddenly there will be an earthquake. It will stop and
then he'll see the black warp like the one in Twisted Flow. He'll get excited
and mention that there must be a crystal. He'll be warped into a room with a
pink crystal and butterflies. He'll be surprised at the butterflies and take a
few steps forward. He'll say that this place isn't at all like the last one and
guess that maybe the crystal is different from the others. He'll be determined
to destroy it and take a few steps forward. He'll think it's funny how there
isn't a totema guard here and then something will appear behind him. Then
another thing will appear. Then they will start to appear everywhere!

------
Fight!
------
You can only bring four (!) people in here, so in addition to Marche and
Montblanc, bring in a White Mage and an Archer. MAKE SURE your guys are level 12
or higher! You're facing eight powerful Ultima Crystals and you need all
thehealth, defense, magic, etc. you can get! The good news is that the Crystals
are
low in the HP category. The bad news? Some attacks you do deal a super-dooper
jumbo killer amount of one damage. You should have gotten a really good bow from
last mission, and if you are smart, you would've equipped that. You can deal
about 35 damage with it from a distance, so always move away from them and fire.
It's hard to tell whether your facing the front or back or sides so don't worry
about that. The crystals themselves have some good attacks. The use Logos a lot,
which weakens your attack AND charms you (ugh!) so bring lots of bandaids with
you. On the positive side, their regular Fight move does around 15 damage only.

Your Black Mage (I used Montblanc) should do Blizzard and it does about 30
damage. Keep your White Mage away from harm, and DON'T keep him near ANYONE who
is charmed. Since White Mages usually have low HP, I usually bring around a lot
of potions and Phoenix Downs since you'll be using them a bunch. If ANY of your
units are KOed, don't waste a turn attacking! You need all four units active if
you want a chance at defeating these guys! Once you heal someone, put at least a
square of distance between them or else the Crystals will use Logos and charm
BOTH units! The Crystals can't move (JOY) so if you are weak in health, you can
retreat to a corner or something without worrying if a crystal will follow you.
I've never seen a Crystal dodge a move, so I'm also guessing that it is
impossible for them to dodge. This battle, while long, can be easy if you bring
the right materials and are at the proper levels.

MAJOR SPOILERS! MAJOR SPOILERS! MAJOR SPOILERS!
Marche will stare at the crystal for a while and talk, and he wil wonder whether
the pink crystal is allied to one of the races. He'll guess Nu Mou totema, and
then the crystal will shatter and a voice will call out. Suddenly, Mewt will
appear and he'll ask Marche why he is making him remember these things. He'll
tell him to stop. Marche will be shocked and then Mewt will say that his mom
isn't dead. He'll then ask who is trying to wreck his world and he'll tell
Marche to get out of his world. He'll then disappear and Marche will find
himself back at the volcano. He'll be all confused about Prince Mewt and "my
world". He'll then suddenly realize something: Ivalice the country is a
reflection of Mewts desires!

He'll slowly put everything together, and then he'll realize another thing: He's
living inside Mewts dream! He'll then again realize, unfortunately, that if he
destroys the crystals, he's destroying Mewts dream world! Marche will bow his
head and the screen will blacken...

You should be at around levels 12 and 13 by the time you are here, so this
should be a decent battle. You should bring out, in addition to Marche, a Black
Mage, an archer, and a white mage. The enemies have decent HP, and their attacks
are pretty good. You don't need to constantly worry about being KOed or
anything, but don't slack off or you can get easily hurt. Their attacks can do
around 50 damage. If you have Famfrit ready, don't use him since he is not
needed for this battle. The other totema (forgot its name) should be used since
it deals a decent amount of magic damage to all. Phoenix Downs should be brought
here just in case you need them. Remember to use the poition exp trick on your
units' first turn, because except for your archer, you won't be able to reach
that many enemy units. One of the units, Martha, has the ability to absorb your
damage so use your archer to defeat her.

Marche will enter the keep and he'll wonder if the emerald crystal talked about
in the mission objection is another one of the crystals he's seen before. He'll
then hear some other people asking him about the emerald and they'll talk for a
bit. The person you're talking to will introduce himself as Babus, the personal
mage to Prince Mewt. Babus will then speak of a person Mewt mentioned who means
Mewt ill. He'll then ask Marche if he knows anything about the person (of course
not... heh heh...). Marche will then shake his head and say he had no idea that
Mewt wanted to change the world like this. Then Babus will figure it out that
it's Marche who means Mewt ill and he'll order an attack on Marche!

BATTLE!
You only have to defeat Babus here so have your strongest three focus only on
him. This is a super-easy battle, and to tell you the truth, I didn't find out
what anyone except Babus does, because I defeated him so quickly, the others
never even had a chance to attack! You should bring out a soldier, Black Mage,
White Mage, and archer. It is unlikely that any of you will be able to attack
the first turn, except for the archer and Marche, so aim both your attacks onto
Babus. There will be some conversation after a couple of moves. After that Babus
will attack. He knows stillness, which can stop time (freeze your unit in its
tracks). A good thing about Babus is that he is low on defense, so you attacks
should deal around 60 points to him.

Save your Totemas here, because you can defeat this battle easily without them.
This battle should be short and sweet, and no healing items should be required.

Marche will enter the cave and then a flame will appear directly over his head.
Marche will find it funny that he is looking at a ghost but he isn't scared at
all. The ghost will move back a bit and Marche will follow. Suddenly, the black
warp will appear! Marche will be warped into a strange room similar to the one
where he fought Famfrit. The crystal will glow and a totema will appear out of
it and absorb the ghost! The totema will call Marche an intruder and then Marche
will tell the totema he came to destroy the crystal and won't leave until he
does (pretty stupid thing to say to a totema). The totema will summon three more
monsters and then introduce himself as Adrammalech. He'll say that he will
protect the world thread by his strength and destroy anyone who tries to disrupt
it!

~~~~~~
Fight!
~~~~~~
Before you actually start the battle, MAKE SURE ALL OF YOUR CHARACTERS HAVE THE
ITEM OPTION EQUIPPED ONTO THEM! You'll be using dozens of items here, and your
hopeless if a unit can't use an item. Send in a White Mage, a Black Mage, and an
archer. And then stare in horror at Adrammalech's attack damage. Yeah it hovers
somewhere between 100-110. So basically, two hits and your dead. Another thing
is that this attack can hit multiple enemies at once!!! A positive thing about
Adrammalech is that he has no ability like Counter, Block Arrows, Return Fire,
etc. I guess Square-Enix realized the difficulty of this guy, because you only
have to defeat Adrammalech to win. The others should be destoryed though. They
are extremely powerful also. Adrammalech's HP is 261, and his defense is 287, so
unless your characters are around levels 14 and 15, you're going to have a hard
time scoring _any_ damage on him! The other three units' HP range is from 170 to
12.

Since the battle arena is VERY small (pretty much just a narrow hallway), you
are going to have some difficulty keeping your units away from harm. Shrink to a
corner if you need to and always keep your white mage at a safe place. Bring
plenty of Phoenix Downs and X-Potions also; you'll be using them constantly.
Also, use a potion, Hi-Potion, or X-Potion whenever one of your units' HP falls
below 100! Otherwise, you'll be taken out in one hit. If your powerful
characters only have around 110 HP, go back and train them if needed. You should
first approach Adrammalech and do your strongest attack (combo, fight, ability,
whatever) on him. If Adrammalech KOed one of your units already (yes he can do
that), then use a Phoenix Down onto them instead. You need ALL of your units
here.

You archer should always focus on Adrammalech, except if another enemy unit can
die by one more hit. You can also attack the others if they are the only ones in
your attack range. Black Magic is very important also because it can hit
multiple enemies from a distance although it is pretty weak (only around 15
points of damage) against the enemies. Remember to always use the potion trick;
it will be really helpful for you to level up during the battle. Like stated
eariler, the other enemies are very powerful and can hit for around 80 points of
damage. They'll use things like fire and ice breath the most, which misses a lot
(it is still very powerful, and they will also just do a normal fight if you're
right next to them. You need to be very patient during this battle because it
can be frustrating and difficult.

After the battle Adrammalech will split into three ghosts and disappear. Marche
will figure out the ghost must've been part of the crystal's power. He will
guess that the crystals are more than just pure magic, he'll guess that they are
some kind of incredible energy... that could've created all totema and races!
The crystal will then explode and Marche will be warped back to the cave.
Suddenly Babus will appear. Marche will freak out and then Babus will mention
that the air is different in the cave. He'll deduce that Marche has been acting
against the prince's wishes. There will then be a voice heard, screaming for
"Mama". Marche will look around and then the black warp will appear. Marche will
say that it was a seam left over and then Mewt will appear. He'll call out
Babus's name.

Babus will be confused and Mewt will then ask where everyone is. Mewt will then
disappear and Babus will talk to Marche. He'll say lets just pretend that there
are two worlds and then he'll ask how much the "other world" is worth to Marche.
He'll ask what Marche has there that he doesn't have here. Marche will fall
silent and Babus asks Marche why he would make the prince suffer over nothing.
Babus will state his farewell and disappear.

Now you must blace Baguba Port on the map. Before you head to Baguba Port for
your next mission, LEVEL UP A LOT! YOUR UNITS WILL BE GONE FOR GOOD ONCE THEY
ARE KOed IN THE NEXT MISSION!

The first time you enter Baguba Port, you'll trigger a cutscene where you'll
meet Montblanc's brother Nono. You'll talk a while and then you'll hear that
Nono got hit by a ship. Marche will say that he has to go to where the people
who hit him are, which is Jagd Dorsa when Montblanc will interrupt, saying he
hasn't explained about jagds. He'll say that a jagd is a lawless zone, where
there isn't a penalty for breaking the law. Marche will say that sounds great,
but Montblanc will say no. He'll explain that death comes easily at jagds.
Marche will not understand and Montblanc will explain that no one ever dies in
engages because of a judge there. Marche will still want to go so they'll head
of to Jagd Dorsa. You'll now get to place Jagd Dorsa onto the map. Save and head
over there.

Marche will be in the center of a deserted town full of bandits and a thief will
tell him to leave if he wants to live. Marche will refuse (stupid thing to do).

BATTLE!
First, YOU MUST REALIZE THAT ONCE YOUR CHARACTERS DIE, THEY'RE GONE FOR __GOOD__
That includes Montblanc also! You WILL WANT to have saved before you enter this
battle and you'll want to have all your totemas ready. The faster this battle
goes, the better. If one of your good characters is KOed, use a Phoenix Down and
make sure they're alive before the end or just turn your Game Boy off without
saving! Begin by placing on of your characters on the bottom right and bottom
left squares because there are two enemy units down there. Send out a Black and
White Mage and an Archer for the battle. Once your all ready, begin!

You should be at around level 15 for this battle, or you'll have a tough time.
All of the enemy units are high in attack and they have high speed and are
likely to attack first. Your first goal is to take out the assassin. She is very
powerful, and can have your units down in a few hits. Make sure you have some
strong attacks when you are fighitng the Toughskin, becuase as its name
suggests, its defense is incredibly high. Your Black Mage should be attacking
groups of enemies. Try to get four very close to each other, because then you
can hit all at once. You should also try to do this to you, because then you
White Mage can heal four of your units. This comes at a price though, because
the enemy units can do some strong attacks.

The monsters down below are not as big a threat as at the top, so make sure the
two characters you send down there aren't very strong. Keep the strong ones up
at the top. Once the assassin is out of the picture, turn to Toby. He has some
powerful attacks with him and some decent HP. Remember to USE PHEONIX
DOWNSWHENEVER A CHARACTER IS KOed. It can't be said enough. Toby's regular
attack is
both powerful and strikes twice, coming to a total of about 100 damage! Have
major patience and if you follow the strategies given, it shouldn't take you
more than a couple of tries to defeat this clan.
*******************

Now you will have to palce Kudik Peaks onto the map. Head back to Baguba Port
for a cinema scene. Nono will get very excited and he'll then offer his reward
he got to Nono so that Nono can repear his airship. Nono will reveal then that
he was thinking of making his ship into a Merchant Ship. Montblanc will think
that sounds like a pretty good idea and then Nono will tell Marche to look out
for him with rare items.

YOU. Ironic isn't it?

Fight!
~~~~~~
Three of your units should be an archer, Black Mage, and White Mage. You'll also
want to make sure you have an HP damaging Totema around. If you have a Bagnaa in
you party, it should have enough JP already to summon one. I used it and it took
out the Black Mage and the Time Mage, as well as highly damaging others. Your
first target should be the Black Mage, since his magic is very powerful. After
that, turn your attention onto Largo the Paladin. She knows how to revive a KO,
and tha tis vrey dangerous. Next should be Sigmund. His regular attack is quite
damaging. Your archer should never get within three squares of a unit because
they have hard hitting attacks. Swena can heal so you should try to eliminate
her quickly. Sigmund knows Strikeback, which is like counter. Gilbert has
Reflex, so he can dodge every fight attack you have. You'll have to use your
Black Mage to take him out.

When you enter the Sands, Shara will appear. Right after, Ritz will appear
behind you. Ritz will assure Marche that they are not after his clan and they
will say they are here for the same thing you are. Ritz will call out for the
enemy units and they will appear.

------
Fight!------
You can only bring in four units, but that's okay since Ritz and Shara are
helping you. They are pretty powerful, at level 18 and 19. Shara will probably
start first. Her arrows can take out some enemies with one hit. As for you, you
probably want to be around levels 16 or 17. Bring out, as usual, an Archer,
White Mage, and Black Mage. The archer should take care of the weaker enemies,
while the Black Mage should take care of the Time Mage and Gadgeteer. Team
Marche up with Ritz and Shara to defeat the units easily. You'll have to watch
your White Mage. Use a Pheonix Down on it if it is KOed. Righte before Ritz
goes, you'll talk a while. Right before Marche goes, you'll talk some more.
Marche will ask why Ritz wants to stay, and Ritz will get very surprised and
stutter. If you make sure Ritz and Shara stay alive, this battle is incredibly
simple.

MAJOR SPOILERS! MAJOR SPOILERS! MAJOR SPOILERS!
Marche will say that he hopes Ritz and Shara don't get bounties for helping
Marche. They will respond by saying they'd turn you in if that happened. Marche
will bow his head and leave, but Ritz will stop him and warn him that she might
join sides with Mewt. Shara will try to tell Ritz to help Marche. She'll explain
to Ritz that she and Marche both have families in the other world. Ritz will
then reveal that she doesn't want to lose her hair... her "non-white" hair. She
will say that she was born with pure white hair, and that she has to dye it
every day in the other world. Ritz will get very sad over talking to Shara and
then screen will fade to Mewt. He'll be very upset and ask why Clan Nutsy hasn't
been captured yet. Mewt will say to hurry, or the world will shatter... Mewt
will call for his mom and say that Marche is being mean to him.

Now place Muscadet on the map. Head to it to trigger a cutscene.

Marche will be sitting at the pub, saying that if there is a totema for each
race, he only has two crystals left. Then Ezel will come in and they'll talk a
little to each other about how things are doing in each other's lives. Ezel will
explain that judges are searching clans one by one looking for Marche. They'll
say their goodbyes and the screen will fade. Save and enter Muscadet again to

Fight!
------
First off, MAKE SURE YOU BUY A LOT OF X-POTIONS! They are not needed for _this_
battle, but this is a two battle mission. You can only bring in three units, in
addition to Marche and Montblanc. The usual mages and archer are a must have
here. This battle can be a bit of a problem since you are outnumbered five to
seven by powerful units. Go for Homer first since he is a high level and can do
some serious damage. Totemas are a must here, because they are so powerful. The
lower level units (the level 15s) aren't that big of a threat so save them for
last. You'll want to do your most powerful black mage attacks on Wilder. The
Templars know Bonecrush, which is a powerful reaction ability so you should
attack from a distance.

The units in the far back aren't very poweful, but except for the level 15s,
take them out soon. You'll most likely be crowded around the center of the
arena, where the two Templars are. That's good, because they are a danger to
you. Use strong attacks, revive whenever you die, and heal when needed for a
quick victory. But the mission isn't over...

MAJOR SPOILERS! MAJOR SPOILERS! MAJOR SPOILERS!
Cid will appear and he will talk to the judge. Cid will order all of Clan Nutsy
to go to prison, but Marche will protest, saying the others had nothing to do
with what happened. Cid will say yes they did by helping Marche. The screen will
fade out, and Marche will be in prison with Cid and Babus. Cid will ask Marche
if he has destroyed the crystals, and Marche will say yes. He will also say that
he has defeated three totemas. Marche will explain why he was destorying the
crystals. Babus will remember this and tell Cid about it. Marche will talk some
more and then Cid will reveal that destroying the crystals will destroy Ivalice.
Cid will ask Marche if there is no other way that he could return home. March
will say he doesn't know and Cid will inform him that he must abandon the
mission.

Cid will talk about all Marche has here and talk about Mewt, but Marche will say
that this isn't right, that it is just an illusion. He will talk more and will
be interrupted by a seam above the wall. Babus will blame the seam on Marche and
then they will warp to the cave with the crystal. Marche will say that he only
has to destroy the fruits to destroy the crystal and then Cid will inform him
that he is alone now. Then Marche will make some wonderful speech and Babus and
Cid won't buy it. Then, you'll enter a battle!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCOURING TIME PART TWO: EXODUS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

VS

Babus: Runeseeker lv. 21
Exodus Fruit: Avatar lv. 18 (8 of them)

Your fighting Babus here. He is very powerful, although he does not need to be
defeated to clear the battle. You must attack all the fruit trees, sort of like
when you fought the crystals. DO NOT try to go around and destroy the crystals
as long as Babus lives. He is too poweful. Babus will most likely start off the
battle by using Demi (reduce HP by one-half). Heal instantly. His other attacks
can kill you in one shot if you don't. If Babus uses Explode and it hits, it is
basically all over for you, so just cross your fingers when "Heavy Fire Damage"
appears at the top of the screen. Sometimes, Explode will hit and only deal
around 110 damage, so if you did what I said before and got those X-Potions, you
can heal constantly until Babus' magic runs out.

If Marche is not an archer, you'll have to attack from short distances, which
can be a pain. Use combos often, and otherwise just stick to the sword. Babus
really only uses explode, so unless it misses, you aren't going to have much
chances to attack him. You'll sometimes get a chance to attack twice in a row,
so be thankful. Babus also knows Counter, so you'll have to deal with that if
you attack from a close range. Once Babus is dead, just go around destroying the
fruits to clear the mission.

EASY EXPERIENCE GAIN! READ!
First, MARCHE MUST KNOW FIRST AID! If he does, then once you defeat Babus go
around and destroy all of the little trees except for ONE! Leave that one and
proceed to use First Aid on Marche. You'll gain ten EXP every time, which means
SUPER-EASY leveling up.

died, his dad stopped caring. Then he will disappear. Cid will be shocked at
what just happened and then it'll fade into white light. Marche, Cid, and Babus
will be back at the prison, and Cid will say that it was him and he does
remember. Babus will be confused, and Cid will talk some more about him and
Mewt. Cid will announce that the judges are now seperate from the palace. He
will also order Marche and his clan to be free.

Marhce will thank Cid, but Cid will then thank Marche. Cid will walk out and the
screen will fade.

Go to Cyril and go to the pub now.

You'll overhear a conversation about what happened with the palace and the
judges. The two will talk some more. The screen will fade to the palace. Cid and
Mewt and Babus will be there. Cid will talk to Mewt, saying don't hesitate if he
needs anything. Babus will beg Cid to stay, and Mewt will order him to be quiet.
Mewt will say some bad things about his dad and his mom and a new character will
walk in. Cid will leave and Mewt and his mom will talk. The new characters turns

BATTLE!
Bring in a Black and White Mage, an Archer, and a Thief for an easy battle. Make
sure the thief you bring in knows Steal: Armor since that can greatly drop
defense. Your enemies are pretty easy, and since your clan should have hit
around level 18 by now, you shouldn't have that much trouble. Your White Mage
needs to be around your weakest characters at all times, but if another
character kneels, then move to them instantly. Your Black Mage should've learned
some more powerful moves, and you hopefully have mythril weapons for him/her.
Also, try as hard as you can to get your enemies bunched up, so the Black Mage
can hurt all of them at once. Don't forget about the Bagnaa who is at the top of
the hill. His attacks are strong. Bring with you Pheonix Downs (lots of them)
and X-Potions because your enemies have strong attacks.

You should try to take out the Bishop soon, because it knows Cura which can heal
around 90 HP to each enemy unit. The two fighers should be your next goal,
because their attacks are very powerful. The thieves are also powerful, but
aren't that big of a threat compared to the others. Use a totema only if you
must, because you need to save it for later. Have fun with this one.

Fight!

5 is the limit on the amount of units you can take in here. Along with Marche,
the regular Black and White Mages and an Archer with you. A thief is not a bad
choice either since they can steal and bring down attack and defense by doing
it. Okay... time to complain about the number you're up against. The units are
    STRONG and totemas are a MUST HAVE for this battle. The White Monk knows are
    powerful Earth move that goes in a straight line, which you'll want to
watch
    out
    for. I suggest you also take him out first. It is unlikely that any of your
    units, even your archer, will be able to attack on the first turn and that
is
    a
    serious disatvantage (you start at the bottom  of  a  steep  hill).  Use
the
    potion
    trick instead and you'll hopefully level up.

With the totema, this should be a quick battle but in case you don't have it,
bring lots of Pheonix Downs. Even with the totema, this can be tough due to the
fact that the enemy units have 150+ HP and totemas only take away 100 or so.
Make sure you have some good abilities stored up also. You'll want to revive all
your characters, due to the shortage you are given. If the battle is something
like three against two your favor and the enemies are kneeling, you don't have
to use the Downs.

Marche will look at one of the fallen bagnaas and he'll demmand to know about
the boy here before the engagement happened. The bagnaa told Marche that he said
he would sell info about you- the fugitive. Marche will ask for any other
information but the bagnaa will say no. Marche will dismiss him, and then he'll
wonder what it means with Doned here.

Thank Square-Enix for only making you defeat Llednar. Again, the usual Mages
(Black and White) and Archer are a must here. Also, do what I usually tell you
to do during defeat the boss battles. One thing here... don't attack Llednar at
all (I'll explain later). Instead, focus your attacks on the regular enemy
untis. Llednar is VERY powerful. He knows Abyss, which damages your units
(around 70) and poisons them. If you are poisoned, you'll want to make sure that
your White Mage knows Esuna, so he can heal great amounts of your units at a
time. Um... one little thing about Llednar. There a little tiny itsey bitsey
problem about him and his defense... you sort of can't hurt him. At all. Period.
Zero damage. So what to do? Just focus your attacks on the enemy units and take
them out.

Your White Mage should also know Curaga, the super-powerful cure move that cures
your units by around 90-100 HP. With this move, you can stay alive FAR longer.
Alright, you are very close to the end of the battle? Why? Cause soon after you
do your second turns, Llednar will raise his sword again, but Cid will ask him

Mateus: Totema lv. 24

Vampire lv. 21
Vampire lv. 22

Okay, you know all of those people I told you to bring out in the first part of
the mission (refer to it if you don't remember), bring them out again. And MAKE
SURE you have Curaga, Esuna, Joint-combos (so you can do a co-op combo), and a
hell of allota HP, ATK, and DEF. This is a very difficult battle, even if your
characters are levels 22, 23, and 24 (they should be around that by now). Your
arena is very small, and that has it good and bad points. It's good because you
can attack on your first turn (some of your units), and bad because there isn't
a good place to retreat when you are in pain. Okay, the enemy units... they are
very powerful. The vampires can warp a long way and they have an area damage
attack which deals around 60-70 points of damage AND poisons your units.

You are going to need your White Mage active at ALL times due to this, so keep
it sheltered by keeping it near a poweful unit (unless that unit is surrounded
by vampires or Mateus). Use Pheonix Downs whenever a unit dies; you need all of
your units active in this mission if you want any chance of survival. Unless you
have absolutely no other choice, DON'T DO ANY ATTACK THAT'LL DAMAGE YOUR UNITS!
The enemies do enough of that. If any of your units are below 100 HP, HEAL THEM!
All attacks except the enemies "Fight" attack are likely to deal over 100
damage. Mateus knows an attack that'll anger you greatly: Breath of God. You may
remember this one from Famfrit, but then it only dealt 40 or 50 damage. Well it
now deals 150-170 damage and it is an area damage attack, so it can hurt up to
five untis at once.

If you have any totemas, USE THEM! You need these so badly, it's not even funny.
Any totema you have should be used. Alright, the strategy to destroy Mateus. No,
it isn't "Deploy three units on the boss, the rest on the other enemies." It's
"deploy six units on the enemies, attack Mateus only when the enemies are dead,
or when she gets in your way". The vampires are a huge frustration, and they are
the ones that deal most of the damage. The quicker you get rid of them, the
better. Only problem is, all of the enemey untis, especially Mateus, are very,
very strong. Mateus has a whopping 412 HP and 211 MP. Not to mention its attack
stat is 437 and its defense stat is 393. Any staff holder is going to have a
hard time touching Mateus with any damage over 10.

Also, the vampires have around 250 HP, so it isn't going to be any easy thing
getting rid of them either. Your Black Mage needs to know at least level two of
the three elements it has (Fire, Thunder, and Ice). Mateus also knows Star
Cross, which is an arena atatck and can damage all your units with, thankfully,
only about 30-40 damage. I doubt your White Mage will even have a free turn
since it'll be running around either reviving, healing, or nullifying status
effects. You are at a weakness when you heal someone. When you heal someone, you
are basically gambling. You know that you have to be right next to someone in
order to heal them. But when you do, only half thier HP. If the zombies use
zombify, HEAL IT!

Zombify can really mess you up. There is one good thing about it though. If any
zombified character is KOed it will, like any other zombie, revive in three
turns. So if you wait three turns then the zombie will become revived and you'll
get be able to heal them when they're already at full health. Good luck on this
mission. You will really need a good amount of it, and even if you have a good
amount, this mission can take you many, many tries.

Okay you've destroyed the final crystal, so now you've beaten the game! Now run
outside and say, "HA! PWNINATED YOU STOOPID CRYSTALS! EVERYONE! WORSHIP ME! FOR
I HAVE COMPLETED FINAL FANTASY TACTICS ADVANCE! MUHAHAHAH!" and continue
laughing until an angry neighbor tells you to shut up and look at the screen,
where you'll find the world hasn't changed back yet. Dammit, you were so
convinced.

MAJOR SPOILERS! MAJOR SPOILERS! MAJOR SPOILERS!
The final crystal will shatter and Marche will wonder why the world didn't
change back. He'll woner if there is another crystal and Cid will say no. The a
disembodied voice will say that the world is still wanted. A seam will appear
and the queen will show up. She'll explain that as long as people desire this
world, it'll still exist. Marche will ask the queen who she is and Cid will
answer, saying she's the queen. Marche will recognize her as Mewt's mother. The
Queen will explain that Mewt still wants this world so the world remains. She'll
also explain that Marche is not yet ready to say goodbye. The the queen will
disappear and Marche and Cid will return to the Sands. Cid will ask what Marche
is going to do next.

Marche will respond by saying he'll go see Mewt. Cid will ask how Marche will
get to Mewt if Mewt won't leave the palace. Marche will shake his head and Cid
will explain that he cannot help Marche. Marche will say it's okay and Cid will
wish him luck. Then Marche will nod and they'll part.
END SPOILERS

Go to Muscadet and you'll se a cinema scene. Marche will overhear some people
talking about how the palace is going to be packed in a couple of days. Marche
will walk over to Montblanc and ask what they are talking about. Montblanc will
respond by saying it's Gift Day. Marche will be confused and Montblanc will say
the "Audience Day" is the official name. Marche will ask if people can go into
the palace during that day and Montblanc will say yes. Then Montblanc will add
that it is only people with connections that can enter the palace. Marche will
ask what kind of connections and Montblanc will tell Marche that if his gift is
good enough, he can still get in. Marche will say he has to try and Montblanc
will tell Marche that he'll ask Nono to help.

Montblanc will explain that Nono is really good with his hands and can make a
fine gift. Marche will thank Montblanc and they'll walk into the pub.

Marche will be walking in the woods and will wonder how much materite he needs.
He'll get a lot and comment on how Nono will make something great. Then the
screen will zoom up to some enemy units, and they'll comment on how good the
streetkid's info was. They'll spot Marche carrying all the materiate and Marche
will realize that they want his materiate. And he'll realize that the streetear
is Doned!

------
Fight!
------
You're up against six tough opponents. If you got the Steal: Weapon ability from
last mission (it's random), congragulations this battles a hell of a lot easier.
Also, Marche and any other human that you have should easily have at least ten
judge points so it's time to unleash Mateus. She is very powerful, and should
take out at least one person and make all others kneel. Still, you should bring
out a White and Black Mage out just in case you don't have enough JP. Also use
the Nu Mou totema, which can drain a great deal of magic. This can be very
helpful, since it prevents the enemy units from using their own abilities. The
level 23 Assassin holds a Masamune, a poweful weapon so STEAL IT IF YOU HAVE
STEAL: WEAPON!

The White Mage knows Curaga, so TAKE HER OUT A.S.A.P! Sloprain is one of the
attacks the enemey units know, and they also know Shining Air, which damages and
blinds. DON'T USE MAGIC ON THE ELEMENTALIST! She knows Abosorb MP, so any magic
will heal her. Take out those specific characters first (White Mage and
Elementalist) and the rest of the battle should be really easy.
---------

Marche will be walking around and call for Doned. Doned will appear behind
Marche and push him down. Doned will reveal something and Marche will recognize
iu. It turns out to be materiate and Marche will demand to have it back. Doned
    will say how he knows all about Marche's plans about using the  materiate
to
    make
    a gift for Mewt. Doned will be taunting Marche and Marche will demand to
have
    to
    materiate back. Doned will back away and throw the materiate  down,
breaking
    it.
    Marche will be surprised at this action. He'll ask what's gotten into Doned,
    because he's been selling info about Marche and breaking his materiate.
Doned
    will say that he never wants to go back to the real world. Doned will inform
    Marche that he'll do anything to stop him.

Doned will then tell Marche that he [Marche] has a reason to go back, that he
can play with his friends. Marche will fall silent and Doned will comment that
he [Doned] has nothing waiting for him back in the real world. Doned will then
turn and run, and Marche will talk (to no one in particular) saying that Doned
has something he wants more than anything.

Suddenly, a map town will appear and place itself down. It is Bervenia Palace.

Montblanc will tell Marche that he gets to relax now and Marche will say it's
hard when the palace has a bounty over his head. Montblanc will try to comfort
Marche by saying no one knows who he is. They'll walk across the bridge and
Marche will say how amazed he is that Nono did such a good job even when there
was almost no materiate. Marche will say that Nono's "lugaborg" will get them
into the palace for sure. They'll walk towards the door and the screen will
fade. The next cinema shows Marche in an empty room. Marche will wonder why
everything is taking so long because everyone else has already left. Montblanc
will say that maybe something is wrong.
He'll say that maybe there was trouble during an audience and then he starts to
say "or..." but then a bunch of people will walk in and Montblanc will finish
his sentence by saying they might've figured out who Marche is. The enemy units
will reveal that they recieved a tip from a concerned citizen. It's, you guessed
it, Doned.

Fight!
~~~~~~
5 is the limit to the number of units you can bring in this tiny battle arena.
Okay these guys are tough, so you defenitely want to bring in a White Mage. Make
sure the W. Mage knows Curaga since it is such a powerful healing move. The
regular Black Mage and Archer are a must. Leave out your weakest character
(duh). If, by chance, you have any totemas left from your last battle, use them,
since it'll shorten the battle by about a third. Except for Marche, no unit will
be able to attack from a one-square range on your first turn. You should be at a
higher level than these guys (I'd say around 25 and 26), so the battle shouldn't
be that be of a deal especially if you did what I said before and summoned a
totema. A positive thing about the first turn this time is that almost none of
them will be able to attack either.

DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT attack the Templar from a one-square range. He knows
the reflex move bonecrusher, which can cause up to 110 damage! Use your Black
Mage or Archer for him. The two Gladiators know strikeback, which isn't as
powerful as bonecrusher, but you should still watch out for it. It can deal
around 100 damage. Another thing you should know about strikeback is that it
prevents you from attacking from a one-square distance. If you try, they'll
block it. The Mog Knight and the Alchemist don't have any special abilities, so
there is no need to worry about them. The level 22 Gladiator knows Beatdown, and
that can do some serious damage, so I suggest you do a move that can raise your
enemies defense. The other Gladiator can do a whirlwind move that damages all
surrounding units for 80-90 damage, so keep you units either close to enemies or
away from each other.

The Mog Knight is able to nullify all status effects, so don't waste time doing
a move like sleep or poison on him. Make sure your White Mage is alive, since
the two Gladiators have powerful moves. Until the Gladiators are dead (try to do
that as soon as possible), have your White Mage simply run around and heal. If a
couple of your units are damaged by the whirlwind attack, you should be able to
cure all of them at once since they are already close together. The battle arena
can be frustrating, with the couches and table in the middle, so battle near the
back, where there's more room.
---------

The screen will fade when you win and Marche will start  towards  the  door
when
three more enemy units will come in. Marche will be defensless when suddenly
Babus will appear and use time stop on the three enemy units. Marche will be
incredibly confused and Babus will announce that he will take Marche to Mewt.
Marche will still be confused, but Babus will explain that he didn't come to
help Marche. He'll explain that he wants to know what the prince is thinking and
that he needs Marche's help. Babus will say that he wants to know about the
"other world" and that he doesn't want to ask, but he knows that he can only ask
Marche.

Marche will step forward and the two will vaish. Cut to Price Mewt pacing back
and forth in front of the throne. Babus will appear and Mewt will ask where he
was.  Babus will tell Mewt that he has a visitor and Mewt will think it's his
mom. Marche will appear and call out Mewt's name. Mewt will be surprised at
seeing Marche and he'll tell Babus that Marche isn't his mom (wow, smart kid)
and that Babus betrayed him just like Judgemaster Cid did. Marche will defend
Babus, saying that Babus wants what's best for Marche. Mewt will counter by
saying that Babus wouldn't bring Marche here if he did. Mewt will inform Marche
that he [Mewt] was the one who ordered your arrest.

Marche will tell Mewt that Babus wants to know if this world is really an
escape, a dream, for Mewt. Babus will explain to Mewt that if this is really a
dream world, it wouldn't be best for Mewt. Mewt will tell Babus to be quiet and
Babus will tell Mewt that he is smart and that he should understand why and why
he should and shouldn't live in a world like this. Mewt will order Babus to be
quiet, that Babus doesn't understand. Babus will admit to this, and he'll
explain that's why he brought Marche here. Mewt will ask Marche why doesn't he
jsut go home, because he wants to stay here, in the dream world forever. Marche
will say that somewhere in his heart, he also doesn't want to return, and that's
why he didn't return when the final crystal was destroyed.

Mewt will say that if he goes back, he'll be picked on, and his dad'll go back
to how he was, and that his mom will be dead. Mewt will call out to his mom,
asking why she left him and his dad, and then Mewt's mom will appear. She'll hug
Mewt and Marche will step forward, telling Mewt that she isn't really his
mother. Mewt's mom will ask Marche why he troubles Mewt, and Marche will respond
back. Mewt's mom will try to comfot Mewt, but Marche will demmand that Mewt
makes his own decision. Mewt will say that he doesn't want to leave, that he
wants to stay. Then the music will change and Mewt and his mom will disappear.
Babus will step forward and then Llednar will appear. Babus will tell him to
step aside, saying that if he is loyal to the prince, he won't let Mewt and his
mother escape.
Llednar will say some weird thing about that he's him and he wants to be here.
Marche will order Babus to leave, and that he should deal with this on his own.
Babus will tell Marche that he sent for Cid, and that it won't be long before he
arrives. Babus will tell Marche to fight well until Cid arrives. Then Babus will
disappear and Llednar will tell Marche that he's interfering with matters that
don't concern him.

MAJOR SPOILERS! MAJOR SPOILERS! MAJOR SPOILERS!
Cid will appear after five turns and Llednar will comment on lucky timing. Then
he'll disappear and you'll clear the mission. Cid will ask Marche where Mewt is

The next scene is after Marche tells the story to Cid. Marche will ask who
Llednar is and Cid will walk toward the windown. He'll reveal that Llednar is
(you ready for this?)

Mewt!
Marche will be incredibly confused an Cid will explain that he is rather a
distillation of an aspect of Mewt. He'll add that it's the most violent,
dangerous aspect. Then Marche will ask why Mewt would make such a thing and Cid
will answer the Llednar is just like the totemas: He was created to protect Mewt
and the crystals. Cid will walk toward Marche and tell him that he will also go
and search for Mewt. Marche will say that he'll leave the searching the Cid and
Babus, and that he will go talk to Ritz and Doned. He says they have to also be
convinced and then Cid will tell Marche that he'll let Marche know when he finds
Mewt and his mother.

Marche will thank Cid and Cid will disapear. Then Marche will say that there is
one other that needs convincing: himself.

When you select the mission, you'll automatically go to a cinema scene with
Montblanc and Marche talking about the next mission. Marche will say that they
need to find Mythrill Ore and Montblanc will ask Marche why he always picks the
tough jobs. Marche will say that he is trying to make a name for their clan, and
Montblanc will agree. Then Marche will admit that he lied, and he just wants
Doned's attention. Marche will admit that he didn't think Doned would come if he
just asked him, so he's trying to lure him in. Marche will say that Doned won't
be able to resist interfering if he hears Marche's looking for Mythrill.
Montblanc will commet on how Marche's changed since they met and that Marche's
much older.

Montblanc will say he means that as a compliment, and Marche will say that he
didn't really know what was going on and he still doesn't.

When you arrive at the cave Marche will be walking around looking for Mythrill
and someone will shout at him to stop. Three people will appear and they'll
accuse Marche of stealing Mythrill Ore. Marche will say that he just wanted to
know if there was any here, but the others won't believe him. Marche will figure
out that Doned told them, and then three more enemy units will appear.

------
Fight!
------
You're at an advantage here sinc eyou are in the middle of the arena. There are
three enemies on each side, so send three on one side, and three on the other.
The Mog Knight knows last haste, so try to take it out without it ever kneeling.
The Sage knows reflex, and that makes it immune to all "Fight" attacks so use
Black Magic to defeat it. The Juggler is able to catch, so don't throw anything
at it. The Blue Mage has Damage > MP and Immunity, while the Animist can block
your arrows. Finally, the White Monk knows the simple reflex move counter,
although it can hurt a bit. The arena is basically a cave of ice, with a middle,
a hill, and a downhill. You start in the middle, three units start downhill, and
the other three are up.

The Blue Mage knows Roulette, and that is a Target Arena attack. What it does is
it randomly decides a unit (it can be yours or an enemy unit) and does a One-Hit
KO. It can actually be quite helpful, since you probably have so many Pheonix
Downs. Your attacks do around 60-70 points of damage if you're at the
recommended level (26). Don't use your totemas, since they aren't needed. You
should have a level three Black Mage move by now, something like Fiagra, so use
that because it causes around 120 points of damage. Be careful of the Sage,
since he knows Bio which damages and poisons. Also, the Jugglers regular attack
causes around 100 points of damage so take him out as soon as possible. The Blue
Mage also has an attack that can reduce your HP by half, which is a target area
attack so take her out as soon as possible also. Other than that, there are no
other real tips I can give you.
---------

Marche will be looking for Doned in the cave. He'll call to him and then Doned
will reveal himslef. Doned will realize that this was a trick. Doned will tell
Marche he already knows what he's going to say, that Marche will tell him to
come back. Doned will refuse and tell Marche he has everything, but Doned has
nothing. Marche will tell Doned that isn't true and Doned will inform Marche
that he isn't sick, that he can run around and have snowball fights. Then Doned
will say that he has lots of things in the dream world. Doned will say he has
friends here, and he can someday engage. Marche will tell Doned he doesn't have
everything, and Doned will ask him what he doesn't have. Marche will say that he
didn't want anything.

Marche will tell Doned that he [Doned] always said that he wanted this and that
and the Marche always had to put up with it. Marche tells Doned that their mom
is so busy looking after Doned, that Marche gets nothing and that Doned gets all
the attention. Marche will say yet again that he doesn't have everything. Doned
will say it is too much fun to leave and that he doesn't want to go back to his
wheelchair. Marche will say he doesn't think he'll lose anything, that he'll be
able to run when he goes back. Then some really dramatic moment will happen and
the screen will fade.

Now place Deti Plains on the map. Go to the pub in Musacdet and you'll see Doned
and Marche talking. Doned will ask if Marche has any idea where Mewt went.
Marche will say no, that Cid said Mewt would never leave the palace so they have
no idea where they went. Doned will suggest if Ritz knows and Marche will tell
him that everyone is too busy with clan wars to care. Doned will sigh and say
they just have to wait. Then a bagnaa will appear and ask for Marche. The bagnaa
will tell Marche that he has a message for him from Judgemaster Cid. Then Marche
will realize that Cid found Mewt.

The bagnaa will tell Marche that the queen and prince were both found in
Ambervale and that Cid wants to meet Marche on Deti Plains. Marche will tell the
bagnaa that he'll leave right away and the bagnaa will leave. Then Doned will
tell Marche that Ambervale is the royal valley. Marche will be surprised that
Doned's heard of it and Doned will tell Marche that it's supposed to be the most
beautiful place in Ivalice. Marche will walk away and Doned will tell him to be
careful. Then Marche will turn to leave and the screen will fade.

Lilith lv. 26
Thundrake lv. 27

Eh... this is going to be a tough battle. Your enemies are all very strong and
can deal around 80-100 points of damage to you. The Lilith is especially
dangerous. She knows Poison Frog, which poisons you and turns you into a (no...
wait for it!) frog. Bring along about twenty Maiden Kisses for this. You start
at a handy-dandy disatvantage because you're at the bottom of a hill. There is a
rive flowing through the middle of the arena and then a higher level that is
pretty plain. As for abilities, there aren't that many. The Coeurl knows Block
Arrows and Reveal while the Jawbreaker knows Block Arrows and Weapon Atk+
(raises Weapon Atk). The Lilith knows no extra abilities and neither does the
Big Malboro. The Thundrake, however, knows Geomancy.

Your archer might be able to attack on the first turn, but any short-range
attacker probably won't. Be careful of the Coeurl also, since it knows Petrify.
Remember, if all of your characters are petrified, it's Game Over. You should go
for the Lilith first and then the Coeurl. After that, go for the Thundrake,
since it is so powerful. All the units have 200 something HP. If you put your
archer in the square in the upper-right, it might be able to attack the Lilith
on the first turn. There's a pretty big chance that the Coeurl will move down a
bit, so you can attack on the second turn. Use your most poweful Red, White,
Blue, and Black Magic to heal and damage. The battle will probably end up near
the downs stairs area because that's where you start, but try to shift up to
upper level because there is a lot more room.

The Thundrake won't attack the first turn (usually) so that's good. Don't use
your totemas here; save them later, when you'll really need them.
---------

After the battle Cid will appear, and he'll be surprised Marche made it so
quickly. Marche will say he has nothing better to do and then he'll ask Cid if
he's met them already. Cid will say no, and that there is something he needs to
do first. He'll ask Marche if he could do something for him, which is go to
Siena Gorge and find some amber. Marche will be confused and Cid will explain
that it's a request from Ezel. He needs it to make a powerful antilaw and Cid
will explain that the anitlaw may be needed in Ambervale. Marche will ask if
he's sure it's okay, since he's the judgemaster and Cid will tell him he's ready
to take the consequences. The two will part and the screen will lower down to
Ritz and Shara. Shara will ask Ritz if they should follow Marche and Ritz will
fall silent.

You must now place Siena Gorge on the map.

Fight!

Nice plot twist. You knew it'd come to this, didn't you? :) White Mage, Black
Mage, Archer, Thief. Okay two words: High levels. Really they are very powerful,
and I admit, I wasn't at the recommended level when I got here. You'll probably
be around level 27 or 28, which is okay, but wait until you hit levels 29 and 30
before fighting. Just like you probably though, Clan Ritz is loaded with extra
abilities. Ritz can catch and she has Magic Pow+ which... you know. She also has
the weapon Femme Fatale. STEAL THIS! Shara has auto-regen, which allows her to
start getting back health each turn when she's hit.

The Fencer has no extra abilities (good, good) but the Summoner has half MP. The
Elementalist can absorb your Color Magic. You are at a disatvantage here, since
you start on the very bottom of a huge hill. In front of your starting position
is a river and a pond below it. You'll have to climb to the top to fight Clan
Ritz. Use a totema here if you must; the quicker this battle ends the better. By
your second turn, you will have probably reached the top. Before Marche moves,
you'll have a little conversation, and then he'll move. High powered Mage
techniques come in handy here (you should have some by now!).

Okay here's the deal: the fencer can deal around 150 damage with her REGULAR
attack. o_0  The elementalist knows Shining Air, which is wind damage and blind.
Ritz also has the super-evil attack doublecast. It allows her to summon two
spells in one turn. You MUST GO FOR RITZ ONLY! The sooner this battle ends, the
better. I know this is tempting but, like I said before, use totemas only if you
must. The next battle is very difficult compared to this already difficult
battle, and you'll need them there. If you have Aim: Legs use it on Ritz. As
long as she can't move, the battle will go easier.

Pray that none of your attacks miss Ritz when you're up close, because her skill
is powerful (another reason to steal her weapon!). Have the thief steal
EVERYONE'S weapon actually, because they are pretty much defenseless without it.
We're talking 20 points of damage. If you use poweful attacks and snatch up the
enemies' weapons, this battle will go a lot easier.
---------

Marche will tell Ritz that he doubts she'll come with Marche if he asks. Ritz
will give Marche permission to pass, but her mind is still made up. Marche will
bid goodbye to Ritz and turn to leave. Then he'll stop and ask Ritz if she'll
hate him for bringing the real world back. Ritz will say no, and she also will
tell Marche that she doesn't think what Marche's doing is wrong. She just wants
to stay. Marche will nod and leave. Then Ritz will tell Shara that Marche's
really going to do it. Ritz will add that the "old" Marche wouldn't have a
chance, but the "new" one will. Ritz will then wonder why she hasn't changed and
Shara will tell Ritz to come on, that the world hasn't changed yet. The screen
will fade...

Ambervale will automatically be placed on the map. When you go to Ambervale, the
game will ask if you want to save. YES, YOU DO! Enter, and get ready for the
final set of battles!

When you select Ambervale, nothing will happen, but when you try to leave,
ENGAGE!

NOTE: Before you enter Ambervale, make sure Holy isn't forbidden! You'll be
      healing a lot here!

Marche will walk in and he'll comment on how beautiful Ambervale really is. Cid
will explain that is was built for prayer, and that it is more of a chapel than
a palace. You'll walk forward and you'll see Babus lying on the ground. Marche
will run over and ask what happened. Cid will say that he isn't dead, just
unconcious. Then Llednar will appear (crap, and I thought we got away) and Cid
will tell Llednar that he and Marche are here to see Mewt and the Queen. Llednar
will tell Cid that even though he's the judgemaster, he cannot pass. Cid will
tell Marche that it's his call, and Marche will say that he's going in. Cid will
then tell Marche he'll help and he'll take out the powerful antilaw card.

Cid will comment on how glad he thought to bring it, and then he'll shout out
that he nullifies all laws protecting Llednar (excellent!). The card will flash
and an invisible barriar around Llednar will shatter. Llednar will be amazed at
this and Cid will tell Llednar that he nullified the "Fortune" law put on
Llednar. Llednar will say how foul this is, and the battle will start!


/\/\/\/\.....BATTLE ONE!...../\/\/\/\
You can only bring in three people in addition to Marche, so make sure one's a
Black Mage and another's a White Mage. The remaining one is your choice, but
make him/her powerful. I recommend a thief to bring along, due to the fact that
it can steal all weapons and weigh the odds greatly in your favor. Surprisingly,
the enemy units don't have a super amount of powerful extra abilities. Llednar
doesn't have any extras (wow...), but the Assassin has Return Fire. The Ninja
has Last Haste and Double Sword, which allows the ninja to make two strikes!
Ack! The gunner has no extra abilities but the Alchemist has Mag Pow+. The
Illusionist can absorb magic, and he also has Half MP. The battle arena is quite
plain. It is perfect size with no obstacles in your way. Marche starts around in
the middle, but your other units are in the way back.

The enemy units start near the door. Thankfully, you only have to defeat the
boss to win. Unfortunately, your enemy units are so powerful it isn't funny at
all. The Assassin causes around 160 points of damage, and Llednar himself still
has his old abilities, although they are much more powerful now. His abyss
causes around 100 points of damage while still poisoning. There is a very high
chance that the enemy units will take out Marche first, so get to him as soon as
you can. The Illusionist in the way back can do a Wild Tornado, which is a
target arena attack that does around 30 points of damage. He also knows
Stardust, which is a really cool looking attack although  Your White Mage will
be running around trying to cure everyone.


If your characters are both poisoned and have sustained damage, HEAL THEM FIRST!
Heal their poison next. You cannot heal Babus so don't waste time going over
there to try. Black Magic seems to do nothing to Lednar, so don't try. REVIVE
ANY CHARACTER THAT FALLS! You need all of them if yo uplan on winning. Totemas
should be used only when needed. Although they make the battle go a lot quicker,
you're fighting two more after this one!
---------

Llednar will say that he feels strange, and that he must win... but then he will
turn to stone and crumble. Cool. Marche will call out to Babus and the next
scene, Marche will be kneeling over Babus. Babus will start to stir and Marche
will ask him if he's alright. Babus will ask where the prince is and Cid will
respond by saying that he isn't here. Marche will say that Mewt is inside and
Babus will verify that. Marche will run over to Babus and tell him that he can't
walk in his condition. Babus will say that he seems to have taken more damage
than he thought and Cid will tell him to stay. Babus will start to protest and
Cid will tell him to be quiet. Babus will apologize and then Cid will say that
he should be apologizing (I still think it should be Babus) and he'll say that
if he got here sooner, Babus wouldn't have been injured.

Babus will say that he is fine, and that they must hurry to the prince. Babus
will turn to Marche and tell him to please help Mewt. Marche will say that he's
sure Mewt will listen this time and then he'll tell Cid to come on. They'll
enter the palace... In the next scene you'll see the queen in front of a huge
statue. She'll comment on how Llednar is gone and Marche will demand to see
Mewt. The queen will say how Mewts now lost another friend and Marche will say
that he hasn't lost anything- that he only thinks he has. The queen will say
that this world is an illusion (oh NOW she gets it) and that you can hold it in
your hand and still be holding nothing. The queen will ask Marche if he's
accepted this and then she'll answer her own question by thinking that he
hasn't. She'll say that here is has a happy family, power, friends...

Marche will say that he did want all those things but he felt like he'd become
someone else when he arrived in the country of Ivalice. Then he'll say that he
hadn't and that there is no "real him" out there. He'll say that he's right
here. Marche will say that Mewt understands and that's why he's torn. He will
ask the queen to let Marche talk to him, that he wants to go back home together.
The queen will remind Mewt that she's on his side and she'll tell him to say
what he wants to happen and she'll make it so. A disembodied voice will speak,
and Marche will call out to Mewt, asking where he is. Then Mewt will appear
curled up in the giant statue's hands. The queen will ask Mewt if he wants her
to leave and Mewt will say no.

Marche will be confused and then the queen will tell Marche to please leave.
Then she'll transform into some warrior and summon two monsters. Cid will ask
the queen if she's a part of Mewt also and the queen will say that she's the
fulfiller of wishes. She'll say how Mewt's dearest wish is to stay here and that
there's another who wishes the same. Marche will ask if it's him and then he'll
say that he doesn't deny what the fulfiller says but the world is just a dream,
and he's done with dreaming.

                      /\/\/\/\.....BATTLE TWO!...../\/\/\/\
                            ENGAGE WITH: QUEEN REMEDI

Heh, this is a living hell. Famrit and Addremalech are two tough enemy units and
the queen will drive you insane. Strangely enough, if you check their abilities
they have NOTHING! At all. Period. You will be able to bring out an additional
five units so that should signal that this will be a hell of a battle since
you're fighting only three. You need to start off by doing some kind of defense
spell on your units if you have one. Remdi will attack and she'll probably just
attack regularly. Ouch. You should be able to go (this is asumming all your
characters are around levels 29 and 30) and attack Remedi for the first time.
Even your strongest attacks will only deal around 60 damage to her. You should
use totemas if you have them. Don't use them all since the final battle will
require some, but use only one or two (you hopefully have around 5 or 6 ready to
summon by now).

The two totemas keep all their old attacks. For exapmle, Famfrit still has
Breath of God, except this time it's a lot stronger, dealing around 120 points.
Addremmalech will use Firestream and strangely, it'll only deal around 60 damage
to your units. You MUST have Life with you since sometimes, you'll have to
revive units from a distance. You probably already figured this out, but DO NOT
BOTHER AT ALL TO ATTACK ADDREMMALECH AND FAMFRIT! The queen is should be your
only priority and if you do, you can end the battle a lot faster. If you have an
ACCURATE attack that can disable, immobilize, or put Remedi to sleep USE IT! NO
matter how many times you say it, it can't be said enough!

Something that might surprise you, Addrammelech and Famfrit's regular "Fight"
attacks don't deal much damage at all. Something around 35 or so. Aside from
those tips, there is no additional info I can give you.
---------

After you defeat Queen Remedi she'll mutter Mewt's name and then Mewt will
appear. Marche will call out to Mewt and say that he's here to see him.
Judgemaster Cid will run forward to Mewt and Mewt will say that if he goes back,
they'll pick on him. He'll tell is father that he's embarrassing him and then
he'll tell his mom to not leave. Marche will tell Mewt that he can help him,
that he can go home with him. Mewt will say that part of him understands, that
part of him wants to go home. Then he'll say that he still wants things to stay
like this. Then Remedi will stand up and walk below the statue. She'll turn and
face Marche and will say that she's the wish-gatherer, that she's the world-
maker. Then she'll say that desire is the thread that binds the worlds together.

Cid will back up and she'll summon some weird power and turn into a floating
blue fairy thingymbob. Cid will say that this is no longer Remedi. It's the pure
essence of every wish that makes up the world. Marche will mutter "every wish"
and then he'll realize that if he defeats the fairy dude they can go home. The
fairy dude will call upond two Mateus's (hey don't you think that's a little
unfair?), some cool music will play, and the final battle will begin.

                     /\/\/\/\.....FINAL BATTLE!...../\/\/\/\
                              ENGAGE WITH: LI-GRIM

Lalala... it has been all fun and games up until now. You thought the last
battle was hard (no? ....shut up!), then wait till you fight this one. Picture
your battle against the real Mateus. How long did it take you? Probably a really
long time. Well now you have to face two level 28 (okay thanks Square-Enix)
Mateus's. They are VERY powerful, and still use all the same old moves
(especially Star Cross; thankfully, it only does around 30-45 points of damage).
You should be around levels 32 and 33 by now which is a good level for this
battle. Okay, again this is strange: The Li-Grim doesn't have any special
abilities but she does have totemas 'glore. You know what sucks about totemas
'glore? Every totema.

You'll need to have about 20 X-Potions and Pheonix Downs. Use ANY totemas you
might have left. Damage ones are good, and magic-sapping ones are nice. Also,
use a move that raises any type of defense or attack on the first turn since
you'll be needing those. Keep your White Mage alive. I don't care how you do it,
just as long as he can heal, your battle will go a lot faster. Remedi will
pretty much only use totemas. You know what sucks? Her damaging totemas will do
amazing amounts of damage. We're talking 300 points here! You'll have to pray
she doesn't use totemas like that if you want a chance at surviving. To weaken
the chance of her doing this, use magic depleting moves. The Nu Mou and Viera
totemas sap magic power from enemies, so use those also if you have them.

Like you probably guessed, don't focus on the two Mateus's. Instead focus on
Remedi. She has an incredible damage attack called Alpha which causes... duh,
incredible damage. Around 340 points or so. Fortunately, it isn't a target all
attack so you can revive the characters. Watch out of Mateu's Spellbind, which
causes around 160 damage AND reduces speed. Crap. Powerful Black Mage attacks
should be used constantly here, as well as any other Color Magic. If you survive
long enough, Marche will call out to Mewt and Mewt will talk to Marche, saying
that he wants to go. Smart kid :) Back to Remedi, she has the power to change
the laws so that can REALLY mess you up so make sure you have some good law
cards. Other than that, all I can say is good luck.

-=-=-=-=-=-<><><><><><=-=-=-=-=-=><><><><><>-=-=-=-=-=-<><><><><><=-=-=-=-=-=

When you finally defeat the damn Li-Grim (hey, I messed up my game so I COULDN'T
leave Ambervale at all and I couldn't go back and train; have some sympathy)
Mewt will stand up and mutter "Mama" The Li-Grim will light up, rise into the
air, and explode. Again, damn Li-Grim. Then Mewt will disappear and Marche will
call out Mewt's name. The screen will blacken...

You'll see Ritz and Shara talking and then snow will fall.  Shara will comment
on how odd it is that snow's falling here, and then Ritz will realize that
Marche must've completed his quest, that the world's trying to go back to the
way it was. Shara will ask Ritz if she's mad and Ritz will say no. She'll just
say she doesn't want to lose her hair and Shara will comment on how vieras have
white hair. Ritz will say that she thinks that all vieras are beautiful. Shara
will say that white hair isn't bad at all, and that Ritz should be proud of it.
She'll say that Ritz is special in that she has white hair. Ritz will comment on
how hard it is trying to be special. Shara will also say that she should laugh
more often and then mayber her mother will be happy.

Ritz will comment on that maybe she's right. The screen will go back to outside
Ambervale. Babus will ask where prince Mewt is, and Marche will shake his head
and tell Babus that he disappeared. Babus will be shocked at learning this news
and Cid will tell Babus to keep calm. He will say that the wishes disappeared,
so he did also. He'll also say that Marche wanted to search for him, but he
wouldn't allow it. Marche will comment on how this world still exists, so that
Mewt must still be in the world. Mewt will appear with the Gran Grimoire and
Mewt will apoligize for making everyone worry. Babus will say Mewt's name and
Mewt will say that he had to say goodbye to his mom (what! After she just tried
to kill us? Crazy kid!). He'll say that she told Mewt to look after his father
and Cid will say that he probably needs it.

Mewt will tell Marche that they should go home, and Marche will tell Mewt that
even if he leaves, his mom is still in his heart, and that'll never change. Mewt
will open the book and then Mewt will wonder if going back to the real world
will be as sudden as coming to the dream world. Marche will say that there
probably won't be any time to say goodbye, but Montblanc will speak up and tell
Marche to leave it to him. Marche will thank Montblanc, and he'll tell him that
he would've never made it this far without him. They'll shake hands and the Gran
Grimoire will flash. Mewt will tell Babus that he might forget him back in the
real world, and that Babus did so much for him. Babus will shake his head and
he'll tell Mewt that he'll remember him [Mewt].

Mewt will mutter Babus's name and then thank him. Then Marche will wonder if the
country of Ivalice will vanish when they go back to the real world. Cid will say
that that's a good question, and that if they wish it, the world will change.
But if the people who belong to the country of Ivalice wish, their world will
still remain. Then he'll say that they might never return, and Mewt will say
he's right. Everyone will say goodbye to Ivalice, and Babus and Montblanc, and
the the Gran Grimoire will flash again. Then it'll close and the screen will
fade...

You'll see a view of Doned at the pub with a bunch of other clan members. Doned
will stand up and a moogle will ask him what's wrong. Doned will say that he has
to go home, and then he'll say goodbye to everyone. He'll walk out of the pub,
and then one by one, the people in the pub will start to disappear.

You'll see a cut to a clan war. The "good" clan will take out an enemy, and then
the enemy will vanish, and the units of the "good" clan will also...

Cut to the town of Ivalice. You'll see Ritz walking with someone. Her hair is
now white. The other person will comment on how her hair is as white as snow,
and then she'll ask if Ritz is going to dye it anymore. Ritz will respond by
saying maybe, if she changes her mind. She'll say that green would be a good
color. The other person will say how gross that is and Ritz would say that it'd
be cool. Then a man will run up to Cid and he'll tell Cid that he used to work
for him. Cid will recognize him as Biggs, and he'll tell him that he looks well.
Biggs will comment on how there is a big project coming up, and that he thought
that Cid would be the best man.

There will be a cut to a kid running up to Doned, who is in a wheelchair again.
The kid will ask Doned how to defeat Final Fantasy (^_^), because he's stuck on
Adremmalech. Doned will recommend Doublesword and Powerbreak (hey, I don't think
you can get Doublesword that early in the game... and Doned was IN the game!).
There will be a cut to Marche and Mewt walking and then the bullies will run up
behind Mewt and throw a snowball at them. They'll fall to the groudn and Marche
will as Mewt if he's okay. Mewt will say that he's fine and the bullies will
tell Marche that he's real kind. Then one of them will add that he's kind... of
dumb (yeah, that sucked...). Marche will stand up and he'll say that his name
isn't "new kid" and that it's "Marche" and he'll tell the bullies not to forget
that.

The bullies will be taken completely by surprise because of this action and then
Marche and Mewt will bend down and gather snow. They'll throw snowballs at the
bullies, and then Marche will tell Mewt that they should go home. They'll talk
to the bullies, saying they'll see them at school tomorrow. They'll walk away,
the screen will rise, and the credits will roll.

Dolce: Black Mage lv. 7
Skimble: Soldier lv. 6
Eugene: White Monk lv. 5
Zeeman: White Mage lv.5

Well they have a Black and White Mage... meaning you'll have to have some good
units fighting this battle. Send your three strongest units out to attack Dolce;
the other three need to go after the white mage. Once the White Mage is down, go
to Dolce, and only attack the others if they interfere with you. You're at the
bottom of a hill, putting you at a disatavantage. No worries. Just use the quick
EXP gain (use a potion even if you don't need it) while your waiting. The
enemies don't have very strong attacks, so you don't need to worry about keeping
your distance either.

Mog Knight lv. 16
Time Mage lv. 15
Juggler lv. 14
Thief lv. 14
White Monk lv. 14
Warrior lv. 15

Easy battle, even if you're around levels 16 or 17. Simply defeat the Mog Knight
to win. The Mog Knight knows Last Haste which, when kneeling, speeds the unit
up. The Time Mage knows nothing other than Time Magic and the Thief knows only
Steal and Call. The juggler also knows Last Haste, in addition  to
Shieldbearer.
The two Bagnaas know nothing other than their main abilities. The Jugglers
Dagger move can damage you and disable you, so beware of that. The warrior's Air
Render does around 45 points of damage. The majority of your attacks should be
able to bring the enemies down to kneeling stats if not KOing them, so this
battle should last only one-two turns.

Dragoon lv. 4
Diaghilev: Alchemist lv. 5
Archer lv. 3
Gladiator lv. 4
Thief lv. 3

There are many enemies here, and they're pretty powerful. It'll be hard
fighting your way through them, so make sure you characters are at least level
28. Make sure one of your characers is a Black Mage, and another an Archer, and
    one more a White Mage. For the remaining units,  just  make  sure  they
have
    decent
    attacks and armor. It would actually be good to have multiple archers, so
you
    can hit Diaghilev a lot from a distance. I suggest getting on one side of
the
    river, and letting Diaghilev come near the other side. Then you can
continue
    to
    hit him for around ten points until he falls. As for the others, always make
    sure you aren't facing your back or side to the enemy and use Pheonex Downs
    whenever a unit is KOed.

Just stay patient and don't break any laws and this battle should be easy.

Swampking Kanan: 18000 gil

-Ex-palace guard (AWOL)-Raiding local towns from a camp in the Uladon Bog
COST: 3600 gil
LOCATION: Uladon Bog
REWARDS: 18000 gil, 40 AP, 35 CP

OBJECTION: Defeat the boss!

VS
Kanan: Templar lv. 19
Dragoon lv. 18
Summoner lv. 18
Bishop lv. 18
Archer lv. 18

As long as you are above level 20, this should be an easy battle. Just focus on
Kanan, since the battle will only last about two or three turns if you do. Kanan
is loaded with abilities. He has Sacred Tech, Dragon Tech, Bonecrusher, and
Weapon Atk+. Keep away from him and use powerful long range attacks to avoid
bonecrusher, since it deals 3 times the normal damage that Kanan would deal! The
Dragoon knows Last Berserk and Doublehand, which are two good abilities. The
summoner's abilities are based on magic: Absorb MP and Half MP, two dangerous
abilities. The Bishop can defend as well as knowing Weapon Def+ (you should know
what that does by now!). Finally, the Archer can concentrate.

You're at a disatvantage here due to the fact that you start far away from the
enemy units. You are in the corner of a swamp. There is a bunch of water to the
right of you, down a drop, and there are waterfalls at the top of the arena. The
battle will probably meet where the enemy units start, but stay there since
there isn't really any "wide" space in this arena. The attacks of the enemy are
all basically short-range, so you can retreat and not have to worry about
getting hurt anymore if you are already in bad condition.

Rayne: Assassin lv. 26
Red Mage lv. 24
Gunner lv. 25
Sniper lv. 24

You notice how all the difficult Wanted! missions are in a jagd? This one costs
a lot, and it gives you some great items in addition to a hefty amount of gil,
but it really isn't all that special. The battle arena is like all the other
jagds. It is a square with a couple things sticking out here and there, and
barrels and rocks scattered around the edges. The buildings are the real
obstacles here, but remember if you push a unit off one it gives you extra
damage. You'll start off in the corner, while the enemies will be spread out
over the rest of the arena. Head toward the middle when you start, since there
only thing that resembles a buliding is a 4-square, 10h thing in the exact
middle that shouldn't give you much trouble.

Now for abilities. Killer Rayne knows Corner as well as Aim, and she has the
ability Auto-Regen, which activates when she's hit and heals about 20 HP each
turn after. Her powerful Assassin abilities consist of Shadowbind, Last Breath,
Nightmare, Auge, Oblivion, and the powerful, dreadful Ultima Masher. The Red
Mage knows only Red Magic, but she does have Magic Pow+. The Red Magic consists
of the weak healing move Cure, as well as Sleep, Poison, and *gasp!* Doublecast.
The Gunner is able to use items as well as knowing Last Quicken. The four
Gunmanship abilities it knows are Confushot, Charmshot, Blindshot, and
Silenshot. Charmshot is the only worry here, due to the fact that it forces you
to attack only your allies (remember, attacking the unit breaks the spell).

Finally, the Sniper is able to use items, and it also knows Concentrate. The
powerful Sharpshoot abilities that it knows are Doubleshot, which allows it to
attack with two consecutive arrows; Beso Toxico, which posions in addition to
causing major damage; Death Sickle, which is quite accurate and dooms your unit
to die in three turns; Doom Archer, which causes MP and HP damage; and finally,
Aim: Weapon, which shatters your weapon. Okay, luckily, you only have to defeat
the boss. Unluckily, Ultima Masher is a very powerful attack that can easily
defeat you enemies in one hit. You should be able to defeat Killer Rayne before
she is able to use Ultima Masher though if you focus only on her. Focusing on
her ensures that you win in one turn, making this an easy battle.

Assassin lv. 14
Archer lv. 15
Fighter lv. 15
Gladiator lv. 16
Lodion: Illusionist lv. 16
Dragoon lv. 16

Crap, a Jagd battle. Which means make sure your characters are all alive by the
time the battle ends. I can't say that enough, keep them alive. Good news about
the Jagd is that you can end battles quickly by doing things that held you back
before. The people here are weak (you should be around level 18 or so), and they
have almost no abilities. The Assassin knows Return Fire, which instantly blocks
arrows and fires them right back at you, so don't use arrows to hurt her. The
Archer in the way back doesn't know any additional abilities, but you'll
probably never get to fighting him. The Fighter in front of Loion doesn't know
anything other than Fighter Tech. The Gladiator, however, knows Weapon Def+
adding to his 255 weapon defense.

The Illusionist knows only one extra ability, which is Half MP. Finally, the
only extra abilitiy the Dragoon has is Dragonheart. The battle arena is quite
big, but both sides start out bunched together on the left side. The battle will
probably remain there, becuase that's where Lodion is. Their attacks are okay,
not dealing a super amount of damage. If you just use your strongest attacks
against the Illusionist (don't worry about the others), you can end this battle
in about two turns.

Archer lv. 20
Hunter lv. 20
Beastmaster lv. 21
Blue Mage lv. 21
Icedrake lv. 20
Thundrake lv. 21

This battle is pretty easy. You only have to be around level 23 or so and you've
got a guaranteed win. The only problem is you're up against six units instead of
the usual four or five. The battle arena is okay. It's just a plain square, with
a rock covering the occasional square. There is also main pond in the center,
and little batches of water scattered throughout the level. Your clan will start
in the far upper-right corner of the level, and then enemy clan will begin in
the far lower-right corner. Now for abilities. The level 20 Archer knows only
Aim, and has only three attacks: Cupid, Faster, and Blackout. None of these are
super-damaging, so you don't have to worry about him. The level 20 Hunter has
only the Action ability Hunt.

His attacks are Advice, Aim: Vitals, and Addle. The Beastmaster knows the Action
abilities Control and White Magic, and his support ability is Half MP. The
Control agilities are Goblin, Dragon, and Panther, while his White Magic
abilities consist of Cura, Shell, and Protect. The Blue Mage's action ability is
Blue Magic, and it has the support ability Immunity. His attacks are Mighty
Guard, Guard-Off, Dragon Force, and Angel Whisper. The Icedrake has only one
action ability, which is Icewyrm. It also has Counter. The Icewyrm attack is Ice
Breath (it is the only attack it has). Aside from its action ability Dragon
Bolt, the Thundrake knows only Geomancy. Its Dragon Bolt attack (has only one)
consists of Bolt Breath.

At the start, it is unlikely you'll be able to do any attacks other than long-
range ones, so stick to the potion trick instead. The enemies all have long
range moves (well, most of them do) so if they get to attack first, it is likely
they'll hit you with something. The Icedrake's Ice Breath attack does around 80-
90 damage to your units, and the Thundrake's Bolt Breath does about the same.
You won't need totemas at all during this battle, so don't use them if you have
one.

Goblin lv. 12

Bomb lv. 11
Malboro lv. 11
Firewyrm lv. 11

This sucks for the enemies... I was at level 49 when I got this mission. Oh
well. Anyway, the layout of this battlefield is a long path on the far left, and
then a HUGE hill taking up most of the arena. You'll start at the top of the
huge hill and the enemies will be scattered about the hill. To get down to the
bottom of the hill quickly, equip Fairy Boots. The Goblin knows Punch, and his
only attack is Goblin Punch, which is weak. There are VERY rare points where it
can be strong though, because it does random damage. It also knows Counter, but
its actual counter isn't that strong. The level eleven Icedrake only knows a
single action abillity: Icewyrm. Its only attack is Ice Breath, a long range,
somewhat powerful attack. The Bomb is weak also. It has no R-abilities or S-
abilities, and only one A-ability.

It knows Blowup, which is a suicide attack that does some pretty good damage,
and Flame Attack which is a... well, flame attack! The Malboro knows Bad Breath
and Goo, but nothing else. Finally, the Firewyrm knows two things and NOTHING
else: Guard-Off and Fire Breath. Okay first, you're going to want to make sure
that Dmg2: Animal isn't banned or you're stuck. You'll want to go for the
Malboro first, because Bad Breath causes random status ailments that can really
mess up your clan. Bring along White Mages that know Esuna, or some type of
attack that instantly nullifies status ailments. Besides the Malboro, the others
aren't much of a threat. The two Wyrms have strong "Fight" attacks and high
defense, so it might be a little tough to take them out.

Dragoon lv. 11
Fighter lv. 11
Fencer lv. 10
Archer lv. 10
Archer lv. 10

The arena of this mission is somewhat like chapter one of The Hero Gaol. You're
battling in an old fortress, and the fortresses height gets higher and higher.
You'll start out near the bottom of the fort, where there is a stream running
through. Enemies will be around the fort, with one of them being at the very
top. The level eleven Dragoon knows Weapon Def+, and it has Jump and Bangaa Cry.
Jump is the more dangerous of the two, but neither of them are super-dangerous.
The level eleven Fighter knows Doublehand, and it has Rush and two long range
attacks: Air Render and Far Fist. Air Render does more damage than Far Fist, but
it only hits one unit. Far Fist is a target area attack that hits for weak
damage.

The Fencer has no raction or support abilities, but she has many Lunge Techs.
Swarmstrike, Featherblow, Shallowtail, Piercethrough, and Nighthawk. Nightahawk
and Swarmstrike are the two most dangerous. Nighthawk deals medium damage, but
has super long range, while Swarmstrike will damage and poison. The human Archer
knows Maintenance, and his Aim abilities are Cupid, Take Aim, Faster, and
Blackout. Beware of Cupid; it'll charm your units and that's always a bad thing.
The viera Archer knows Concentrate, and also Boost, Cupid, Take Aim, and
Blackout. Make sure techniques are forbidden when you enter this battle. It'll
disable the Fencer, which means one less enemy you'll have to deal with.

You should also bring the missle law card, to disable the Archers. That'll
simply mean that the Fighter and Dragoon are your only worries. Go for the
Fighter first, due to his long range attacks. Then get the Dragoon. You can take
out the next three in any order, due to the fact that they won't really hurt you
that much.

Firewyrm lv. 22
Icedrake lv. 21
Gerland: Thundrake lv. 20
Bomb lv. 21

Thankfully, this is a small battle arena. That's good (I hate large ones;
enemiems are too spread out). You start on one end of a little hallway while all
of the enemies are grouped together on the other end. The Antlion knows Weapon
Def.+, and LV3 Def-less and Sandstorm. LV3 Def-less is a pretty dangerous attack
that you should watch out for. The level 20 Red Panther  knows Counter and
Reveal, and its attacks are Poison Claw and Rend. Poison Claw um... poisons your
unit so be careful of that attack. The Firewyrm knows Weapon Atk+, and it
already has a powerful Weapon Attack of 328, so beware of its "Fight" move. It
has Guard-Off and Fire Breath. The Icedrake has a powerful Counter and Weapon
Def+.

Its attaks consist of Mighty Guard which greatly increases status, and Ice
Breath. The Thundrake knows Geomancy, and Dragon Force and Bolt Breath. Finally,
the Bomb knows two weak attacks: Blowup and Flame Attack. Gerland is a pretty
nice threat to your clan, so take him out first. Use powerful Color Magic to
defeat him. You should also use a summoner to cast Carbuncle on your clan. Once
that's cast, you'll be immune to magic. Also, make sure your Summoner knows some
powerful atacks. Due to the fact that the enemies are all close together, your
summons could damage a lot of them at once. If you know Doublecast, it's even
better!

Defender lv. 21

You will fight this battle on what looks like a happy, tropical island in the
day. Oh, but we're fighting it at night. That sucks. Anyway, you'll start in the
back corner, while the enemies will start off right in front of you. To the
right of both clans, there is a HUGE spot to battle, but I suggest sticking to
where you are. There's plenty of space anyway. Anyway, the main dude is Lord
Ghost, who is pretty tough. He knows Block Arrows and Weapon Atk+. His powerful
attacks consist of LV? S-Flare, Miasma, and Zombify. The White Mage knows Absorb
MP and Turbo MP. Turbo MP doubles the amount of MP required for moves, but it
also greatly increases the attack and accuracy of magic attacks. She knows Cura,
which heals plenty of HP, Shell, and Protect.

The Time Mage knows Last Quicken as a reaction ability. Last Quicken allows the
Time Mage to take the next turn whenever he becomes critical. That can be
irritating, so take it out in one turn if you can. It also knows Shieldbearer.
The Time Magic it knows is Haste, Quicken, and Slow. Haste makes a unit faseter,
Quicken makes a unit take the next turn, and Slow slows down a unit. Both
Defenders know  Hibernate and Mow Down, and the one on the left also knows Aura.
You'll want to go for Lord Ghost boy first, due to his power. Bring along a
Paladin who knows Holy Blade to take him out in a single hit. Or you can use
Burial or Exorcise, but they have bad accuracy.

Go for the Time Mage next, because his time moves can really piss you off.
After, go for the White Mage. Finally, the two Defenders. Everyone but Lord
Ghost has no real weakness, so there isn't really any additional help I can give
you. Don't use up all your magic though, just in case Lord Ghost is revived.

Mog Knight lv. 7

Yay, six dudes to fight. Anyway, here you'll get the other twin sword, Ayvuir
Blue. But you'll have to fight your way through some pretty weak guys to do it.
If you read The Hero Gaol in order, then you should be over level 20 right now.
If you went right to this mission after finishing the first chapter, you should
be at about level 10. No matter what, this is a pretty easy battle to fight.
Anyway, you're fighting on a bumpy V. As you get closer to the corner of the V,
it becomes more bumpy. Okay, now for the wonderful abilities. The Gunner knows
Concentrate, and has many Gunmanship moves. Confushot, Charmshot, Blindshot, and
Silenshot. Charmshot is the most dangerous out of those, so avoid it at all
costs.

The Black Mage is very weak, knowing only Fire, Thunder, and Blizzard. Even
though it's a Black Mage, he's one of the least of your worries. The Time Mage
knows Last Quicken, a very annoying reaction that allows the Mage to take the
next turn the moment it becomes critical (kneeling). His attacks are Haste,
Slow, Silence, and Quarter. The Animist knows Sheep Count, which puts units to
sleep, 100% Wool, Tail Wag, and the most annoying Cuisine, which restores all
lost HP. Take the Animist out in one hit or it'll restore all HP. The level
seven Mog Knight has a ton of things. Mog Attack, Mog Lance, Mog Rush, Mog
Shield, and Mog Aid. Finally, the level nine Mog Knight is easily the most
powerful.

It knows two action abilities: Charge and Gunmanship. It also knows Last Haste
and Geomancy. The two Charge abilities are Mog Guard and Mog Lance, while his
Gunmanship abilities are Fireshot, Boltshot, and Iceshot. You'll want to go for
the Mog Knight (level nine) first, due to his power. If you enter the battle
when Missle is forbidden, you'll greatly decrease the Mog Knight's power and
completely disable the Gunner. If you bring along a Color Magic law card, the
Black Mage will be disabled also, leaving you with only Mog Knight abilities and
the Animist.

This is an easy battle. You'll want to be at a recommended level of 9 before

Archer, White Mage, Black Mage, and three other strong units. Ludora is the one
you'll want to attack first, although it also knows counter, so your Black Mage
and Archer should take care of it. The others are no problem. Just do some
powerful attacks and they are down. It shouldn't take you more than a couple of
turns. Have your strongest unit move out towards the back, where the stronger
enemies lie instead of taking care of the one in front (let your two weakest
units take care of Ludora).

At the start, just bring out each character one at a time, and then start toward
the first couple of bombs. There are two in the back corner, and you should
take care of those last. They have a highly damaging attack when their HP is
low, so make sure you either do one hit KOs or take off half their HP at a time.

Tonberry lv. 18
Tonberry lv. 19
Masterberry lv. 20

Three fat dudes are your enemies here. Surprisingly, you are allowed to bring in
six units against their three so, as you probably already figured out by now,
send out two units on each one. The battle arena is basically a square with many
obstacles in it (mainly houses). It's large, and the enemy units start out
spread apart. You'll start out on the bottom (south), and one enemy will each
take up the north, east, and west sides. The Tonberry (level 18) knows two
attacks, and one is pure evil. It knows karma, and then it knows knife, which
reduces your unit's HP by... nine tenths! The level 19 Tonberry is the exact
same as the level 18, and the Masterberry also knows knife (damn...), but it
knows Voodoo as well.

If you keep your units spread out among the three, this battle shouldn't take
more than three turns. Remember to heal if they use knife (you'll be doing that
often; unfortunately, Knife is quite accurate). Once you have at least one of
the berries dead shift to another, but you don't have to divide it 3 on each.
Oh, and PRAY that the Tonberries don't use karma on you. It will do 999 damage
to your unit :(

You'll love this law: It only forbids law cards. Heh, that'd be cool if you used
a law card to nullify the law, but we're getting off track here. The battle
arena is perfect (why can't all battle arenas be like this?). It is basically a
big square with absolutely no obstacles. Both clans start in the middle, so you
should be able to attack on the first turn. You can only bring in five units, so
bring in your strongest five (no, really?). They enemy units are loaded with
abilitiesw. The Dragoon has, in addition to Dragon Tech, Sacred Tech, Strikeback
(so NO one-square range moves), and Shieldbearer. The Paladin to the left of the
Dragoon knows White Magic and Half MP, so take him out quickly so he can't heal.
The Defender knows Sacred Tech and Shieldbearer, but the Sage has no extras
except for items.

Finally, the Illusionist knows, in addition to Phantasm Skill, Blue Magic and
Half MP. You'll basically want to use all of your strongest attacks here, since
that's what they are going to do. It should be a rough battle, since there are
no laws (there's a judge though, in case you wanted to know). Since everyone
starts off close together, you can do a Color Magic attack and hurt them easily.
Their attacks will only deal around 70 damage to you, and you'll only need a
couple of Pheonix Downs. This tourney is one of the easier ones, but take my
word for it: they get harder.

You can only bring in four people for this tourney. The enemy units are strong
and you should be at around level 26 before entering. A White Mage is a must
have here, as well as a Black Mage with any powerful black magic. Archers are
also recommended. They have a lot of abilties also that have to do with magic.
The Blue Mage has Absorb MP and Half MP, so don't use any Black Magic on her.
The Black Mage knows Return Magic, so when you do a magic attack to him, he'll
do magic right back. Only attack if it is very powerful and you know you can
take him out or if you can withstand the counter blow with lots of HP left. He
also knows Geomancy.

The White Mage has the same extra abilities as the Blue Mage: Absorb MP and Half
MP. The Red Mage knows, like the White and Blue, Absorb and Half MP. You aren't
going to be able to use magic on the Red, White, and Blue (haha) mages and
you'll have to use caution when using it on the Black Mage. I suggest you get
your own absorb MP abilities for your units, since that is basically all they
do. Um... the laws also prevent you from using No Color magic, so you have to
use... Color magic. Crap, that means only the Black Mage can attack. Alright,
seeing as how this is going to be impossible, you might have to bend the laws a
little bit.

That is all the strategy I can give you, because Black Magic is the only allowed
thing. You can risk some yellow cards, but always use Color Magic to finish the
units off. Good luck.

Um... what's wrong with this picture? You'll notice that the tournament grounds

due to the fact that NO ONE can attack in the water. Unless you have Feather
Boots, which allow you to walk on water. Luckily, the enemy units also can't
attack in the water. There is a TINY patch of land in the middle of the arena,
which is about as big as the land will get, so fight there. There are also
patchs of land on each side which, if you didn't notice, was the place that you
and your enemy units started on. There is also the tiny area that the judge is
on, and a couple of one-square little areas that are best suited for people with
long range attacks, like Mages and Archers.

Okay first off Target All is forbidden (go figure) and Law Cards are also
forbidden, so you can't ban Target All. Okay, now for the abilities. The
Gladiator knows both Spellblade Tech and Monk Tech, as well as Doublehand. The
Spellblade Techniques are Wild Swing and Ice Sword, while the Monk Techs consist
of Air Render and Earth Render, two long range attacks but they are still
nothing to worry about. The White Mage knows both White Magic and Summon Magic
as well as Shieldbearer. Its White Magic consists of the two powerful attacks
that are Curaga and Esuna, while it also has a minor attack of Shell. The Archer
has both Archer and Sniper abilities, as well as Concentrate. Its Archer
abilities are Aim: Legs which immobilizes your character, Cupid which charms
your units to attack others, and Take Aim which is never-miss damage.

Its only Sniper ability is Doubleshot, which allows it to fire two consecutive
arrows. Finally, the Dragoon has both Dragon Techs and Sacred Techs, as well as
Weapon Def+. The Dragon Techs it ahs are Jump and Lancet, two attacks which you
should be used to by now. The Sacred Techs are Warcry and Cheer. You should go
for the White Mage first, due to Curaga and Esuna and its powerful summoner
abilities. Your second goal should be the Archer, although you can do the rest
in any order (Archer included) since none of them are that powerful. If you have
a Heavy Damage Target Area attack, it could end the battle quickly, so use it if
you have them.

Archer lv. 26
Warrior lv. 27
Fencer lv. 27

Don't surrender when they give you the chance. These guys are basically your
lunch. Sure they aren't as pathetic as levels 14 and 15 but they are around the
27s, where as you should be around the 30s. The archer in front of you has an
extra ability, "Concentrate" while the Warrior to the left of you has the extra
ability, "Monkey Grip". The Fencer has, in addition to Lunge Tech, Spirit Magic
and Shieldbearer. Finally, the Gladiator has Strikeback, which blocks any one-
square range attack (it blocks it, don't even try) and hits the unit back. It
also has the Support ability Doublehand. Their attacks are decent though. They
deal around 90 points of damage, so you might have to use a Pheonix Down or two.
Besides that, this should be one of the easier battles in the game.

VS
Alchemist lv. 27
Black Mage lv. 27
Time Mage lv. 28
White Mage lv. 25

Okay, this is your second battle of the Clan Leagues. And again, it is an easy
battle. The highest level is 28, and you should be around 33 and 34 with
(hopefully) a secret character or two. Since it is a wandering clan, I can't
describe the layout of the battle arena, but here's their abilities: The
Alchemist knows Abosrb MP (crap) and Magic Pow+. It has a ****load of attacks
also. Meteor, Rasp, Flare, Poison, and Toad (this turns you into a frog that
does a super-incredible-mecha amount of one damage, as well as dropping your
defese pretty much all the way). The Black Mage knows Geomancy, and its attacks
are Fira, Firaga, Thundara, Thundaga, Blizzara, and Blizzaga. The latter of the
three are very dangerous, and you should try as hard as you can to stay out of
the Black Mage's attack range until he falls.

The Time Mage knows both Last Quicken and Turbo MP. Its attacks are the regular
Time Mage attacks: Hsate (speeds enemy units up), Slow (slows your units down A
LOT), Stop (stops one of your units in its tracks), Silence (silences your
unit), and Demi (really annoying; halves the HP of one of your units). Finally,
the White Mage's abilities are Last Hast and Turbo MP. It, fortunately, doesn't
know anything that can revive a unit, but it does have Cura, Curaga, Esuna,
Shell, and Protect. Cura, Shell, and Protect aren't that bad, but Curaga and
Esuna are dangerous due to the fact that Esuna heals all stats changes and
Curaga is a very powerful healing move. I'd go for the Black Mage first, and
then the Time Mage. Use your own magic and powerful attacks against the units
for good results.

Make sure that none of your units are KOed, otherwise, the battle will go a lot
longer.

VS
Sniper lv. 32
Summoner lv. 29
Fencer lv. 31
White Mage lv. 30

They were the former champions, so as you would except, it's no super easy
battle like the last two. Again, random locations so I can't tell you the battle
arena. The Sniper's abilities consist of Block Arrows and Concentrate. His
attacks are few, but powerful. Beso Toxico damages and poisons, and its damage
rests around 110. She also has Doom Archer, and Aim: Wallet. You should be
relieved if Aim: Wallet is used since you should have at least a million gil by
now. The Summoner has Magic Pow+, and it can summon Ifrit, Ramuh, Shiva, and
Madeen (be thankful she doesn't have Doublecast!). The Fencer has no extra
abilities, but her attacks consist of Checkmate, which dooms a unit in three
turns, Featherblow, which is an aimed attack, Shallowtail, which reduces speed,
Piercethrough, which attacks for two squares in front of the unit and goes
through any obstacle, and Nighthawk.

The White Mage knows both White Magic and Spirit Magic. Its White Mage abilities
consist of Cura, Esuna, Shell, and Protect. Nothing major, but Cura and Esuna
can cause problems for you. Her Spirit Magic abilitiy (she only has one) is
Sliprain. You'll want to use powerful target area attacks often here, but don't
use arrows on the Sniper (remember, she has Block Arrows). It might be good if
you taught one of your units Return Magic, so whenever the Summoner attacked,
you could attack right back. When you get to the White Mage, take her out since
she can heal lots of HP. The Summoner should go next, and then the Sniper. Leave
the Fencer for last, simply because its attacks aren't that strong.

VS
Gunner lv. 33
Thief lv. 31
Gunner lv. 29
Animist lv. 31

So here it is. The fourth match for the Clan League missions. Okay, again,
random battle arena. These guys, surprisingly, don't present a lot more of a
challenge than the last clan you fought. The level 33 Gunner knows Damage>MP and
Concentrate, and his attacks consist of Fireshot, a shot that burns you,
Blotshot, a lightning shot, Iceshot, an ice shot, and Stopshot, which stops one
of your units in its tracks. The Thief has the Item ability, as well as Counter
and Doublehand. He also has Steal: Helm, Steal: Gil, Steal: EXP, and Steal: JP.
The level 29 Gunner knows Concentrate, as well as Confushot (confuses your
units), Charmshot (charms your units to attack only your clan), Blindshot
(blinds your units), and Silenshot (silences your units). Confushot, Charmshot,
and Blindshot are the only three major things that you need to watch out for.

The Animist knows Shieldbearer, and its attacks consist of Cusine, Tail Wag,
Chocobo Rush (a stampeded of Chocobos straight down a portion of the arena; does
around 30 damage), Frogsong (turns you into a frog... augh), and Catnip. Go for
the level 33 Gunner first, because of its strong attacks. The Animist should go
second due to Chocobo Rush and Frogsong. Go for the level 29 Gunner after that,
due to Charmshot. The Thief should go last, since its attacks aren't that
threatening. They all have decent attack stats and moderate defense. If you are
at at least level 33, this is a very easy battle.

Assassin lv. 28
Summoner lv. 28
Sniper lv. 29
Elementalist lv. 28

Um... what's wrong with this picture? Anyone care to explain why they are weaker
here than when you first fought them? That's just messed up but oh well! The
only thing forbidden is Law Cards so basically, you have no laws here which is
great. You can only bring out four but all you have to do is defeat the boss,
which is great. The Assassin knows Concentrate, and its attacks consist of
Shadowbind, Last Breath, Aphonia, Nightmare, and Auge. The Summoner has both
Summon magic and Red Magic, as well as Shieldbearer. Luckily, she doesn't know
Doublecast, although Ifrit, Ramuh, and Shive are strong without it. Her Red Mage
attacks consist of the inaucurate Sleep move, and Poison. The Sniper (who is the
boss) has a lot of good abilities.

She knows Concentrate, and her attacks consist of Doubleshot, which is like
Doublesword, Beso Toxico, which causes major damage as well as poisoning the
unit, Death Sickle, which curses your units to die in three turns, Doom Arhcer,
which damages both HP and MP, and Aim: Weapon, which shatters your weapon. The
Elementalist knows Spirit Magic, and it can absorb magic as well as knowing
Magic Pow+. Its attacks consist of White Flame, Shining Air, Evil Gaze, Heavy
Dust, and Sliprain. Only focus on the Sniper, since her HP is around 200 and she
can die in a turn or so. After that, you win. If the others get in your way,
attack them but don't send a unit off to attack an enemy unit that isn't the
boss.

I can tell you that, first, bring out your whole clan. Go for the two red
dog-type things first. Use your strongest attacks and use Montblancs Black
Mage powers to easily defeat them. It is another good idea to use some combos.
Use Christine's bow to take them out from a distance and use Roland's White Mage
powers constantly. The goblin is easy. Just use simple attacks to defeat him.
Once they're all dead, you've cleared the mission!

Pragera: Floateye lv. 4
Ningilth: Red Panther lv. 3
Kamsotz: Red Panther lv. 3
Gelato: Black Mage lv. 6

If you've been doing a lot of missions, this is an EASY battle. Slowly move your
units out, and wait if you can't attack. Make sure you've brought a White Mage,
just in case you need it. It is likely that you won't be able to attack on your
first turn, but on your second, start dealing major damage. Try to take out
Gelato first, because he is a Black Mage. The Red Panthers aren't that big of a
threat, unless you're at a low level. Pragera has 46 HP, and a combo from Marche
can on hit KO him. Use Montblanc to take out two enemies at a time. This battle
should be very easy, so you shouldn't have to worry about using healing items.
Once you've defeated all the enemies, simply destory the two blue orbs to clear
the mission.

All except Virr are at level four now, and your characers should be level 6+
making this an easy battle. Use Montblanc's Fire ability to take out the Ice
Flans, and use Marche and a bagnaa to take out the Lost Ones. You should have
brought in a White Mage, just in case. One your first turn, you'll rarely be
able to reach anybody, so just move up close to the Professor.  The Lost Ones
aren't very powerful, so just use sipmle attacks. This battle is really easy if
you don't overdo it.

Sewels: Bomb lv. 9
Chimar: Bomb lv. 10

Femakk: Firewyrm lv. 9

I recommend being at least level twelve for this battle. Bring out, in addition
to Marche, a black mage, a white mage, an archer and two other powerful units.
The units are slow, so you should have the first move. Go for Viktranki, since
he is pretty powerful. The Archer should be attacking the enemies in the back,
so they are weak when you get to them. A Totema is recommended for the battle
because it can seriously decrease your enemies health. The enemy units have low
HP, and they are fond of fire damage. Your Black Mage should use Blizzard, since
it is pretty powerful against the enemy units. The Firewyrms can attack with
around 80 (!) HP, so take them out as soon as you can. Keep your White Mage
active and out of harm, and bring along plenty of healing items.

You must assist Clan Ritz in this one. You can only bring in two additional
units in... addition to Marche. This battle super-easy since Ritz and Shara are
lv. 13 and lv. 12. Take out the Juggler first, since it knows Stop Time which
can freeze your units in their tracks. Ritz and Shara are powerful enough, and
should take out the majority of the enemies for you. The two sprites should be
your next goal, because they are weak. You'll want to bring in a unit that knows
Exorcise also, because you can use it on the zombies. Otherwise, they'll revive
themselves after three turns. Still, if you save them for last they should both
be dead.

The enemies are strong, and you should be at about level nine or up before you
challenge them. You should be able to hit Farbazos on your first turn, so do
that. The other enemies are quick, and have some strong attacks so make sure
your units have some high defense. The Sprite is very weak, so use a soldier to
hit it for a one-hit KO. The Goblin is so-so in attack and defense and it should
take you only one-two hits to defeat it. As for the rest of the enemies, just
use Montblanc. Keep your White Mage alive at all times in case you need him, and
keep him away from serious harm.

Heh... this mission first appeared when I was around levels 38-40... so unfair.
Anyway, you only need to be around level 7 or 8 to clear this mission. The
battle arena is like any normal city. It is a square with pots located next to
all the buildings, and there are buildings scattered about although the highest
located is 15h. The enemies have almost no abilities. The level 6 Floateye knows
Counter, and its only move is Stare. The Ahriman's only ability is Circle. The
Beastmaster knows both control and White Magic though. The Control moves he
knows consist of Floateye and Undead, and the White Mage moves consist of Cure,
Shell, and Protect. Finally, the level 5 Floateye knows Stare and Devil Gaze
(now do you see why this mission is called Staring Eyes?).

Go for the Beastmaster first due to its White Mage abilities. After it is dead,
the others are basically left defensless. Take out the level 5 Floateye next and
then the Ahriman. Finally, go for the levle 6 Floateye. Use powerful target area
attacks to secure a victory within your first or second turn.

You should be at a recommended level of around 23 or 24 by now, so this battle
should be very easy. The Red Panther who's at level 21 knows Reveal (and Rake,
its default). BOTH Antlions can counter while the Sprite has Weapon Def+ which
raises Weapon Defense. The level 19 Red Panther also knows Reveal, while the
Jawbreaker has no abilities. Stick to long range attacks for the farther ones,
and use your strongest units to fight the Red Panthers, which you should try to
take out first due to their power. Go for the Antlions next, and then the
Jawbreaker. The Sprite is very weak, so you should save it for last since it
isn't that big of a threat.

but the other two don't have any extra abilities. The Coeurl can reveal, but
other than that, no extra abilities. The Cream knows Germancy, but nothing other
than that. The Coeurl is very strong, so use your most powerful units to take it
out. It should be taken out first, since it can really cause some damage. Focus
your attacks on the Red Panther that is at level 16 next, and then the one at
level 15. Your fourth target should be the Red Panther at level 13, and finally
the Cream at level 14. Aside from the Coeurl, the attacks are pretty weak unless
you are aound level 14 or so. If you are, I suggest leveling up a bit.

Thief lv. 19
Hunter lv. 20
Archer lv. 20
Hunter lv. 21
Thief lv. 20
Gunner lv. 21

This is a strange battle arena. It is shaped like a circle, but it has odd walls
that are somewhat like that of an old castle (you can still walk on them), and
many brick buildings scattered about. You'll start at the very top and the
enemies will most likely start near the bottom. The fight should end up
somewhere in the middle of the arena. Okay, this fight should be pretty simple
as long as you are at level 21 (at least; I was at level 33 when I first fought
this... bleh) Okay now for abilties. You're fighting six units here so this is
going to take a while. The level 19 Thief knows both Thief abilities and Ninja
abilities, as well as the dreaded Double Sword, which allows him to strike twice
with two different swords!

His Steal abilities consist of Steal: Armor, Steal: Access. (stands for
accessories), and Steal: Gil. He has only one Ninja Skill attack but it is very
powerful: it's Oblivion. The level 20 Hunter has both Hunt and Fighter Techs,
but nothing else. The Hunt abilities consist of Sonic Boom, Aim: Vitals, and
Addle. The Figheter moves consist of Rush, Blitz, and Beatdown (remember this
attack can be very powerful, but it is all or nothing). The viera Archer knows
both Aim and Corner techniques, as well as the support move Concentrate. The Aim
techniques consist of Aim: Legs, Aim: Arm, and Cupid. The Aim: Legs and Aim: Arm
combination is very dangerous, so beware of that. Also, Cupid charms your units,
so watch out for that attack.

The level 21 Hunter knows both Hunt moves and Battle Tech moves, and the support
abilitiy Concentrate. The Hunt moves it knows are Sonic Boom and Aim: Vitals
while the Soldier abilities are all Breaks: Powerbreak, Mindbreak, Magicbreak,
and Speedbreak. The level 20 thief knows Steal and Stunt moves, as well as the
Reaction ability Damage > MP, which makes all MP damage moves HP damage moves.
The Steal abilities is knows are Steal: Shield, Steal: Access., Steal: Helm, and
Steal: Gil. Nothing to worry about, but if he steals your shield and helm, it
can bring your defense down a TON. The Stunt abilties consist of Dagger, which
damages and disables, and Smile. And finally, the level 21 Gunner. It is able to
use items and it knows the Support ability Concentrate.

The Gunmanship abilities it has consist of Confushot, Charmshot, Blindshot,
Silenshot, and Stopshot. Charmshot and Stopshot are very dangerous to your
units, and Confushot can also mess you up. Now for a strategy. Since these guys
are basically all equal in power, it seriously doesn't matter in what order you
defeat them. If you want a quick battle you could use a totema, since you should
be at a high enough level so that the totema takes them all out in a single hit.
If you don't have a totema or don't wish to use one, group the enemy units
together down in the middle so you can attack five at once and use a powerful
target area attack. Remember that some critical hits can knock units off
buildings, causing additional damage.

This battle can last a long time due to the fact that you are fighting six
enemies, so I strongly suggest that you DO use a totema, like the human one
which is the most powerful. If you have Double Sword, this battle can go a lot
faster as you have guaranteed one-hit KOs. Otherwise, use strong abilities. If
you have a move like Bonecrusher or Counter, it can also speed up the battle
(Bonecrusher especially). Try to have a unit with Full-Life, since having all of
your units alive speeds up the battle a lot.

at level 15. But you CAN'T LET HER FALL! Use all healing magic to keep her
alive. The Red Panther doesn't have any extra abilities except reveal, and the
Firewyrm, Titania, Sprite, and Malboro have nothing extra. Go for the sprite
first, since it is so weak. Use strong Black Magic here, and strong fighting
attacks. Don't use fire against the Red Panther and Firewyrm, since they absorb
it. Use any type of ice attack.

as your units are above level 8, and they should have hit ten by the time this
mission comes around! Their HP doesn't go above 80 except for Dammuna. Move all
your characters out at first and use long distance attacks to take down quite a
bit of their HP. Once you get up close, your attacks should be able to KO most
of them in one hit! As I said before, very easy.

Sniper lv. 28
Defender lv. 25
Gunner lv. 26
Red Mage lv. 27
Time Mage lv. 28

First off, I'd like to tell you about the battle arena. You are at a major
disatvantage since you start at the bottom of a steep hill. It is basically a
bunch of bumps (small ones) that slowly get taller as you get further north.
There are no major obstacles in your way, except for some trees around the edges
of the area. There are a lot of enemies here, which is quite frustrating since
the battle can go long. Your enemy units are around the near 30s (mostly 26 and
27), so you should be around the early 30s before you fight them. Now for their
abilities. The Ninja at the fron knows Last Haste and Double Sword, which allows
him to strike twice when he does "Fight". It can be very dangerous, so take him
out as soon as possible. He has a TON of attack moves however.

They are Wood Veil, Fire Veil, Earth Veil, Metal Veil, and Water Veil, which are
pretty good. The Sniper above him knows Auto-Regan, and her attack moves are as
follows: Doubleshot, Doom Archer, Aim: Armor (it knocks your armor off), Aim:
Weapon (it forces you to drop your weapon), Aim: Wallet (not that much of a
threat; it makes you lose gil, but barely any. The Defender to the left of the
Sniper doesn't know that many attack moves. He knows both Defend and Monk Tech
moves, and his abilities are Last Berserk and Shieldbeaer. Beware of his Far
Fist and Earth Render attack, since they are powerful target area moves. He also
knows Aura and Mow Down, two things you'll learn to hate. The Gunner below you
has pratically no abilities.

He knows Last Quicken, which speeds him up when he is kneeling, but aside from
that all you need to watch out for is his Blindshot. The Red Mage is very
dangerous. She knows both Red Magic abilities and Fencer abilities, as well as
Absorb MP and Magic Pow+. Her Red Magic consists of Sleep and Poison (sleep
isn't that accurate and you wake up after you're hit, so don't worry about
that). She knows Doublecast, which is the real threat. Doublecast allows her to
cast to spells in one turn, so take her out soon. She also knows Checkmate,
which dooms your character to die after three turns, and Nighthawk. Finally,
I'll tell you about the Time Mage. He has both Time Magic and Alchemy Skills. He
also knows the abilities Last Haste and Immunity.

Beware of his Demi attack, since it halves your units' HP, and also his slow
attack. He also knows Meteor, a powerful attack. What you want to do is first go
for the Ninja. Hopefully, you have a Heavy Damage attack that targets more than
one, since it'll come in handy. You'll want to send out at least two of your
strongest units on the Red Mage, since she is possibly the most dangerous. The
others (the Time Mage, Sniper, Defender, and Gunner), aren't that big of a
threat compared to the other two, but you should still beware of their attacks
(the Sniper especially).

AFTER BATTLE...
Go to Ezel's card shop to see a cut scene. Marche will say hello to Ezel and
Ezel will talk about how nice the timing is. He'll say he's been wanting to talk
to Marche for a while and that he needs his help. Marche will guess that he
wants Marche to gather ingredients for your antilaw cards and Ezel will say no,
it's not like that. He'll reveal that he wants Marche to be a mediator with him.
Marche will be shocked by this and Ezel will explain that the resistance and the
palace have agreed to hold talks and Marche will say that he can't imagine
either of them in the same room, let along talking. Ezel will say that no matter
how amazing it is, they're willing to talk and they need a mediator. Ezel will
say that he tried to weasel out [My clan name is Weasel :)] but they insisted.

Marche will ask Ezel if they talked him into it and Ezel will nod. Then Marche
will ask Ezel where he comes into the picture, and he'll ask Ezel if he's enough
of a mediator by himself. Ezel wills ay that some people are against the talks
and they need a guard to make sure no one interferes (sense something here?).
Marche will say he understands, and then he'll start to say that it doesn't
sound that bad, but then he'll stop and Ezel will ask him what's wrong. Marche
will explain that the palace still has a bounty on his head and that if he goes,
they'll imprison him for sure. Ezel will say that there's no chance because they
made Ezel the mediator, and he's at least the second most wanted man in the
country.

Marche will fall silent and Ezel will tell him not to worry so much, and that if
things begin to go wrong, just get out of there. Marche will slowly calm down
and Ezel will say that he'll put up a request at the pub, just to make it
official. Marche will say that Ezel has nerves of steel and the screen will
fade...

VS
Defender  lv. 24
Defender lv. 25
Templar lv. 23
Templar lv. 24

First off, the Templar in the way back has SaveTheQueen, a VERY poweful weapon,
so steal it if you have Steal: Weapon. Also the Temlar in the back has
Bonecrusher and Half MP, so don't attack from a one-square range. The other
Templar has Weapon Atk+ which raises weapon defense, while the Defender in the
front has Last Berserk, where the unit goes on a rage when it's kneeling. The
final unit has Weapon Def+ which raises weapon defense (no, really?). A White
Mage is CRUICIAL here, and so is a Black Mage. Archer is optional, but I
strongly suggest you bring one in, although if your units are around levels 25
and 26, you'll do fine without one.

Since your units and the enemy units start on the way opposite sides of the
room, short-range attacks will not be possible on the first turn. Even some
long-range attacks won't be possible. The battle arena is basically a hallway
with a stone blocking four squares in the center. This isn't a problem, since it
is so small. You still have plently of room to maneuver. Your battle will
probably meet in the middle, so fight there. If you need to heal, run to the
opposite side of the stone where no one will probably be and heal. You should
have Cruaga by now and you should be at a good enough level so that it heals
around 200 HP.

Use your Black Mage to take out groups of units at one time. Save your totemas,
since they are not needed here. The level 24 Defender knows Earth Render, a
straight line attack that can deal around 70 damage. The Templar on the left
knows jump, a powerful long range move, and the Templar at the top can speed
time. Group combos are useful here, but other than that, just use your strongest
moves within the law to easily clear this mission.

The mission objective will be "Destroy all targets" but there are no targets in
plain view. They are all the way across from you, and they are two stone
statues. The battle arena is quite bumpy, but there aren't really any obstacles
to get in your way. There are small squares of water and some torches, but other
than that you should have no problem getting to the statues. The Ruin Ward thats
right in front of you blocks arrows, so stick to a strong one-square range
attacker. The level 13 Ruin Ward that has a sword in its back has no extra
abilities on him, but the Titania-looking Ruin Ward next to it knows Weapon Atk+
(she already has a Weaon Atk of 203). The red snake Ruin Ward knows Weapon Def+,
and it already has a Weapon Def of 202.

Don't bother trying to attack the enemies; just stick to heading up the ledges
until you get to the statue. An archer should be able to take them out in one
hit, as well as a Color Magic attacker. They should go down in one hit.

  |START____| |_|


As you can see, you'll have to use about a turn traveling to their location.
You'll probably meet in the middle, where you should just stay instead of trying
to get to a bigger area. The Archer has both Aim and Battle Tech, and he also
has concentrate. His Aim attacks are Aim: Legs and Aim: Arm. If he uses both on
one unit, they are basically KOed, since they can do nothing. His soldier
abilities consist of Mug and Provoke. The Thief (human) has a lot of abilities.
He has both Steal abilities and Black Magic abilities. He can also absorb magic,
as well as he knows Geomancy. His thief attacks are Steal: Gil, Steal: EXP, and
Steal: JP, while his Black Mage attacks consist only of Blizzara and the
powerful Blizzaga.

The level 29 moogle thief knows both Steal abilities and Gunmanship abilities.
His reaction ability is Last Haste, and his support ability is Concentrate. His
thief abilities are Steal: Armor, Steal: Shield, and Steal: Weapon. Of course,
if he does all this, you have no way of attacking or defending yourself for the
battle so it really messes you up. His Gunmanship abilities are Blindshot and
Stopshot. The Animist knows both Call abilities and Stunt abilities, as well as
Shieldbearer. Its Animist abilities are Cuisine, Chocobo Rush, and Frogsong.
Chocobo Rush and Frogsong are the only dangerous ones out of the three. He also
has Firebomb and Ball as his Juggler abilities. The Jelly that was created out
of the sketchbook (weird) has Counter.

His powerful attacks consist of Acid, Sacrifice, Fira, and Firaga. I'd go and
defeat the Jelly first due to his powerful attacks, and then turn your attention
to the human thief. Next should be the Archer, and then the Animist. Your final
goal should be the moogle thief. Remember that the Jelly is very weak against
ice attacks, so use black magic to defeat it. The thief seems to dodge
everything (really), so always attack from behind when you have the chance. His
"Fight" move is pretty good, but if you have counter you can deal a nice amount
of damage back to him. The Archer has decent attack, but Disable is the main
thing that is annoying about him.

OMGWTFLOLBBQIMO here it is! The Showdown! Against the weakest clan in the world!
Well, at least compared to you. The battle arena is too messed up to draw, but
you start around the middle and there is a big open space south and to the left,
and a big open space north. I'd head south since you'll need room for this
battle. The Mog Knight knows both Charge and Gunmanship, as well as Geomancy.
The Charge moves consist of Mog Guard, Mog Lance, and Mog Aid (very original,
aren't they?). The Gunmanship moves are Fireshot, Boltshot, and Iceshot. The
Gunmanship abilities don't do much extra damage than the regular gun shot, so
don't worry. The Summoner knows Half MP, and her summon moves are Unicorn, which
heals; Ramuh, Shive, Kirin, and Carbuncle (be thankful that she's missing
Doublecast).

The Paladin knows Monkey Grip, and it can use items. It knows Nurse, Drop
Weapon, and two powerful holy attacks: Saint Cross, which is a target area holy
attack and Holy Blade, which attacks only one unit, but causes major damage.The
Dragoon knows Weapon Atk+, and its attacks consist of Jump, Lancet, Fire Breath,
Bolt Breath, and Ice Breath. Jump is the only one there you need to watch out
for but luckily, it's innacurate. The Assassin knows Shieldbearer, and it also
knows Last Breath, Agua, Rockseal, Oblivion, and Return Fire (blocks all arrows
shoots an arrow back instead). The Alchemist knows Magic Pow+,  and it knows
Astra, Meteor, Rasp, Flare, Poison, and the dreaded attack that turns you into a
frog: Toad (heh).

Okay the Paladin should be your first goal, and then go for the Summoner. Use
powerful Target Area or All attacks to get them both at once. The Alchemist
should go next due to its power. Beware of Meteor from the Alchemist, since it
is a powerful heavy damage attack. Go for the Assassin next and then the
Dragoon. Finally, go for the Mog Knight. This should be an easy battle if you
keep all your units alive.

Rush is one of them and Nume performs it. It is powerful, so take Nume out. Your
at an advantage here, because you begin at the top of the hill. The first enemy
unit you should take out is the Black Mage. Its magic is VERY strong and can be
performed from a distance. I'm serious about the Black Mage. The damage is
around 70! Your archer should focus on the gunner, while your most powerful unit
needs to be focused on the following enemy units in turn: Black Mage, Gunner,
Ninja, Red Mage, Blue Mage, and Thief if not yet KOed. Don't use your totemas
unless all the enemy units will die in a hit by it AND if you have all your
units alive.

Remember, on the way to the recommended enemy units, use the potion
trick and attack anything in your way.

Your enemies are few, but powerful. Likewise, you can only bring in five people
for this mission. Choose a soldier, a Black Mage, a White Mage, and two other
powerful units that you have. You might want to bring out an archer, if you have
one level 9 or higher, so you can do some good long distance attacks. You will
most likely not be able to reach anyone on the first move so just use potions.
The Lamia like to do Hand Slaps, and they delay the next turn AND are pretty
powerful, so either have good defense or make sure it misses! Since your White
Mage probably has low HP, keep it close to a strong unit, so it can be
protected, and heal when needed. Your black mage (preferably Montblanc) should
use fire and ice to attack the Lamia. Have patience, this may be a difficult
battle.

You simply have to destroy the two targets near the top of the right side of the
arena. Problem is there are a bunch of difficult enemies to get in your way but
don't bother fighting them. If you do for the experience keep their abilities in
mind. The Ruin Ward (gargoyle looking thing) can counter for major damage. The
flame Ruin Ward has no additional abilities (yay). The Titania-type Ruin Ward
has Weapon Atk+ adding to her already high Weapon Atk stat. The floating-eyeball
type Ruin Ward also has Weapon Atk+ which adds to its 330 Weapon Atk stat. The
two targets are actually the odd statues. A hit from a bow can do them in.
Remember the Floating Eyeball Ruin Ward knows Roulette, the random death move
(he took himself out when I did the mission... loser) which is sometimes good
and sometimes bad...

Other than that, you just need to avoid the Garoyle looking Ruin Ward because
his attacks are the most damaging. Bring along an X-Potion or two just in case.

Black Mage lv. 26
Time Mage lv. 25
Gadgeteer lv. 26
White Mage lv. 28

Ooooh... scary mission name ;) Okay this battle arena is VERY bumpy. It has
rises in falls in it at the south end, and it slowly gets higher (with the
occasional bump down) as you near north. The highest point is 15H, and that
isn't a very big area. I suggest you battle where the height is 10H and 11H.
Okay now for the abilities. You're fighting an evil amount of six here, so there
are a lot of different attacks to describe... crap. The Elementalist has both
Spirt Magic and Red Magic, and she can also absorb magic and she has Magic Pow+.
Her Spirit Magic consists of Fire Whip, Evil Gaze and Sliprain (this attack
damages and really slows your unit down). Her Red Mage abilities consist of
Sleep and (NOOOOOOOO!!!) Doublecast.

Since Doublecast allows her to cast two spells in one turn, this can make her
very dangerous, so take her out as soon as you get the chance. She has about 220
HP, so if you are at the recommended level of around 31, it should only take you
a turn. The Bishop knows Half MP, but aside from that he knows nothing except
his standard action ability attacks, which are a lot. He knows Cura, Dispel,
Holy, Water, Aero, and Break. Cura can get really annyoing, since it can cause
you to waste a turn or so going back to kill an enemy that was already severley
damaged, so take him out after the Elementalist. The Black Mage is dangerous
also. It has two action abilities, which are Black Magic and Blue Magic, and its
reaction ability is Return Magic. It also knows Turbo MP.

The Black Magic he has is Fire, Fira, and the powerful Firaga. The Blue Mage
abilities it knows are Stare, Night, and LV? S-Flare. LV? S-Flare is VERY
damaging, and you need to pray that he avoids using it. The Time Mage knows only
Time Magic and Shieldbearer. Its Time Magic consists of Slow, Stop, Silence, and
Demi. The two major things there are Stop and Demi, since stop halts your
characters so it can't do anything at all and Demi halves a unit's HP. Slow is
pretty bad also, because it reduces your unit's speed by a TON! The Gadgeteer
knows Pandora and Damage > MP. Damage > MP makes all MP damage HP damage. Its
only attack is Silver Disc. Finally, the White Mage has both White Magic and
Alchemy Skills. It also has the support ability Turbo MP.

The White Magic is simply Cura and Esuna, although those are two dangerous
attacks. The Alchemist skills are also very dangerous: They are Death and
Poison. Your first goal, as stated before, should be the Elementalist. Next go
for the Black Mage. The one after that should be the Bishop, then the Time Mage,
the White Mage, and the Gageteer. Don't be afraid to use totemas here. Magic-
sapping totemas are very helpful, due to the powerful magical attacks the enemy
clan has. If you have Doublesword, this battle will be very simple. If not, just
use powerful Color Magic to damage (summons are also recommended).

missions, so this shouldn't be of any major challenge to you. A second plus is
that there is four enemy units to your six. (I hope you bring out six!) A Black
Mage that knows any type of fire move is good here, and you should always bring
along a White Mage. The arena has a river here, and you will start on the bottom
section of a hill. There enemy units should be quite close to you though, so
attacking them your first turn shouldn't be a problem. Taking an archer with you

You're fighting five people here. The battle arena is pretty unique, so I'll
just show you a map:

 ----------------------------
|                           |
|      ENEMIES SPREAD OUT   |
|         ----------        |
|         |   3    |        |
|         | square |        |
|         |  pit   |   START|
|----------        ----------

The enemies are really spread out, all the way to the other side of the starting
point, so it can take some time getting there. You'll likely meet up in the
middle of the arena, where you should simply stay due to the nice amount of room
you have. There are almost no obstacles in the middle, except for the cactuses
on each side. The enemies have some good attacks also. The Firewyrm's ONLY
ability (including Action, Reaction, and Combat Combo) is Fire Breath although
it is strong. The Icedrake has only one attack ability, Icewyrm, and the two
attacks that branch from that are Mighty Guard and Ice Breath. The Dragoon
(level 21) has Dragon Tech and Shieldbearer. Its Dragon Tech abilities are
Lancet, Fire Breath, Bolt Breath, and Ice Breath (three breath attacks?
*shudder*).

The Thundrake has Dragonbolt only, and the two attacks branching off of that are
Dragon Force and Bolt Breath. The level 22 Dragoon has Dragon Tech and Last
Berserk, and its two Dragon Tech moves are Jump, which jumps onto the unit and
causes some heavy damage (luckily it is innacurate) and Lancet. You luckily have
to defeat only the boss to complete this mission, and that is the level 21
Dragoon. Focus your attacks only on him if you want the battle to end quickly.
Since he'll probably start far away (the enemy locations are random although
they've always started out far apart for me). If you have a heavy damage move,
you can use that and instantly KO the Dragoon, but only if the character doing
the move is at a high level.

The Dragoon boss doesn't have a good range of movement, so it might take you two
turns if your units don't have a good range either. If any of your units know
Double Sword, and they have a high attack, you can also end the battle quicly.

-----NOTE---- You now get to place a new location on the map: Ozmonfield.

VS
Meow: Coeurl lv. 35

Woah, who carries around a Coeurl as a pet? And what Coeurls go "meow"? Anyway,
Meow has some pretty good attacks. He is able to block all arrows, and he has
the Support ability Reveal. His attacks are Hastebreak and Blaster. Those are
okay attacks, and Blaster is the more dangerous out of the two. You can only
bring along four units, but that is more than enough here. I suggest one of your
units is an Alchemist that knows Death. Death is an incredibly useful move that
causes an instant KO and it is quite accurate. If you don't have an Alchemist
then bring along some units with heavy damage attacks. You should at least have
one heavy damage attack by now. Meow should only take about a turn to defeat due
to the fact that it has around 360 HP.

You can only send three units into battle, so make it your three highest levels.
It really doesn't matter though, since you are only fighting a level seven. She
knows counter, and its powerful, but you should be able to easily defeat her. No
Black or White Mage skills are required here, just do regular fight attacks. It
should only take about four turns (three if your lucky).

VS
White Mage lv. 8
Warose: Thief lv. 9
Warrior lv. 6

Most of you have probably let an area be taken after you having to free it
dozens of times. If you ever want to see missions 69-87, you'll need to start
collecting turf from the dispatch missions. Eventually the Area Freed! rumor
will appear and you can do these missions. Okay, these guys are very easy. The
White Mage has only White Magic, and no action or reaction abilities. He has a
White Staff, which is a terrible item so you don't have to worry about his
"Fight" move. He can be annoying due to the fact that he can cure HP and status.
The Thief knows the reaction ability Counter but other than that, all he knows
is Steal. He has a Survival Vest, which is a decent item early in the game, so
steal it if you can.

The Warrior is very weak, only at level six. He has decent armor and a decent
weapon though, but due to his weak status, he isn't much of a threat. He also
knows the reactoin ability Counter. Go for the units in the order that I just
listed them. If you are above level ten, then it doesn't matter in what order
since you are likely going to take them all out in one hit. But the White Mage
will keep running around and healing, so eliminate him first if you can't deal
one-hit KOs.

VS
Raven: Paladin lv. 9
Black Mage lv. 8

Okay, if you're at a level of nine to thirteen, Raven is freaking hell for you.
His holy magic attacks are a pain, usually eliminating your units within a
single hit. If you are at a high level though, Raven is meat for you. He knows
Counter and Monkey Grip. If you are at levels 9-13 like I said before, don't
attack Raven from close up, because his counter is strong. He has a Diamond
Sword, which is good so you should try to steal it if you have to ability. The
Black Mage isn't as bad as Raven, but he is still a pretty big pain. He knows
both Black Magic AND Blue Magic, as well as the reaction ability Return Magic.
If you are using a powerful magic spell against the Mage, be prepared to eat up
the same spell.

His regular "Fight" move isn't that strong, but you still have to worry about
his long range magic attacks. Go for Raven first, because he can eliminate your
characters easily. If the Black Mage is causing a big problem, put Raven to
sleep, or stop time or something. Just make sure you get him out of the way.

This little clan of three is strong, but they have one MAJOR weakness: They are
all Mages. If you bring along a Color Magic law card, then you'll completely
disable them, except for the Red Mage, who knows Spirit Magic. To make it so
that the Red Mage can't cast Spirit Magic on you, bring along a Summoner. Give
her Carbuncle, which casts reflect on all of your units. If you do that, and ban
Color Magic, your enemies are TOTALLY disabled. If you steal their weapons,
you're pratically invincible!

This Borzoi match has you fighting a level fifteen, then two level twelves. If
you're at least level sixteen, you'll have no problem against these guys. The
Sniper knows both Sharpshoot abilities and Aim abilities, and it also knows
Concentrate, which increases hit rate. The Time Mage knows Time Magic and White
Magic. Time Magic can be very dangerous, and White Magic is plain annoying due
to the fact that it constantly heals. The Black Mage has an Angel Ring. This
item is incredibly rare and if you wear it, it'll bestow Auto-Life and cure a
bunch of different status ailments. Bring along a thief with Steal: Access. to
take it from the Black Mage. You'll get it, and prevent the Black Mage from
instantly reviving!

Gukko: Fighter lv. 15

White Monk lv. 11
White Mage lv. 13

Okay, in this final Borzoi match, you're fighting Gukko, the leader. He is
tough, and so are his three allies. Make sure you have all of your clan members
equip Fairy Shoes, because you'll start way up high in the arena and there isn't
much room. With Fairy Shoes, you can instantly teleport to the bottom. Gukko has
Far Fist, which is a long range, target area attack so make sure you don't cramp
all your units together. He also has the dreaded ability Double Sword, and his
two swords are the Atmos Blade and Kwigon Blade. If you have any units that are
weak in HP or defense, he can take them out in one hit. Gukko is definitely the
first guy you'll want to eliminate on the battlefield. The Sniper has both
Sniper abilities and Fencer abilities.

She also knows Concentrate, which increases hit rate. The White Monk has Monk
Tech as his action abilitiy, but no second A-ability or R or S-abilities. The
White Mage knows White Magic and Shieldbeaer, and he has a Cure Staff. Cure
Staffs heal units instead of damaging them when units are hit, so even if you
have a move that takes away all of his MP, he'll still have the ability to heal.
Put the White Mage to sleep or stop him while you are focusing on Gukko.
Otherwise, he'll keep healing Gukko and you'll eventually die. The White Mage is
your second target after Gukko. Good job, Clan Borzoi is out of business.

Yeah, make sure you bring along a law card that makes fire illegal. Beware of
the first level 10 Bombo and the level 9 and 14 Bombs; they all know Counter, so
stay away from them. All you need is a Black Mage with Blizzara and Blizzaga. If
you bring that Mage along, you'll instantly KO the Bombs using those moves. This
is quite an easy battle, even if you are around levels eleven and twelve.

Mog Knight lv. 13
Mog Knight lv. 12

This is quite an easy battle. You'll fight two very weak Mog Knights here. The
level 13 one knows both Mog Knight abilities and Juggler abilities, as well as
Damage>MP and Concetrate. Damage>MP means as long as the Mog Knight has at least
one magic point, he'll lose only MP. That means you'll have to take out all of
his MP and then attack him in the same turn. I suggest using either a magic
totema or simply a unit with powerful moves to take out his MP, and then use
Quicken on your most powerful unit so he/she can kill the Mog Knight. The level
twelve Mog Knight is easier because he doesn't know Damage>MP. He does know
Charge and Gunmanship, and the Support ability Concentrate.

want the battle to go quickly, you should level up your characters to twenty-one

nothing else except for the level nineteen Lilith,which knows Weapon Atk+. Make
sure you bring someone with Astra or someone with Esuna. The Liliths have some

instantly nullify a status ailment. And Esuna can cure all status ailments, too!

Bring along someone that knows Reflect, or a Summoner that knows Carbuncle, and
cast the moves on your unit. It'll make them immune to any magical attacks. Or
you could ban ice, but I suggest banning missle. Since all the Mog Knights know
Gunmanship, they'll be reduced to using only Charge. All the Mog Knights know
Geomancy, and Kraken knows Weapon Atk+. If anyone in your clan knows
Fiagra/Thundaga, then use it on Kraken for a one-hit KO.

or White Monk, use long distance attacks. Also bring a law card that bans status
ailments and use it AFTER you put Lich to sleep. This'll prevent the Mog Knights

Cachusha since they are all powerful. To make it easy, stop them or put them to

have both Corner and Sharpshoot. Celia also knows Concentrate, and Redy knows
Shieldbearer. To take care of both Assassins (you should go for them first),
don't use physical attacks.

Instead, stick with long-distance magic. If you have an instant KO move, you can
get up a little closer and use that. Once the Assassins are gone, just focus on
Silverlock. Be careful; he knows Bonecrusher, which counters with 1.5x the

Full-Life, Esuna and Curaga. Those are basically the only three spells it needs
to know and you'll be fine. You need Esuna because of Bad Breath; it causes a
number of random status ailments, and can be VERY annoying.

That's a pretty nice deal. Anyway, this is the final Foreign Fiend mission and
you're up against a VERY powerful Dread Lord. A Dread Lord is basically a
powerful vampire. One of the quickest ways to take the Dread Lord out is to
bring out a Paladin that knows Holy Blade. Use it on the Dread Lord and it'll
cause massive damage. If you don't have a Paladin (how could you not?) then use
Demi until it gets to where you can take it out in a couple of hits.

Archademon lv. 34

Unlike all the other missions in this game that are pathetically easy, this
mission is TOUGH. One thing that really sucks is that if you fail this mission,
sorry but you won't get another chance. You should be around levels 44 and 45
before attempting this if you want a solid chance. Gukko has aparently returned,
as a vampire who is pretty powerful. He knows the reaction Block Arrows, so you
can't use Archers, and he also knows Weapon Atk+. The two Apandas (basically
Ahrimans) know Weapon Atk+, and one of them knows Roulette, which is probably
the most annoying thing in the world. The two Archademons are tough, and they
both know Counter. Use powerful magic from a distance to stop them. Okay here,
you'll want to bring out a Time Mage.

Stop all of the units to make things a LOT easier. Go for the Ahriman with
Roulete first, and then proceed to take out the other Ahriman, and then the two
Archademons. Save Gukko for last because he is able to revive every three turns
(he's a vampire now, remember?). Use powerful holy magic on him to shut him up.
Good job, you rule Ivalice now.

Ogma: World Wyrm lv. 46 (!)

Holy crap, the World Wyrm can talk. Okay sorry. This is a big-time, very fun
battle. You can bring in four people to fight this powerful, level 46 World
Wyrm. He doesn't know any extra abilities except Geomancy. The battle arena is
filled with lava. You start out at the bottom, on rock and the outer edges of
the arena are all rock. All down the middle is lava, so bring a lot of things
that allow you to float. Hopefully, you have any type of secret character by now
(Semi or non-semi, doesn't matter) so you can use them to deal massive damage.
The Omga has an insane amount of HP (561) so it's going to be a long battle.
Also, his attacks deal around 230 damage to your characters, AND they're long
range. A move that can disable Omga is recommended here.

A totema isn't needed here if any of your characters have a "Heavy Damage"
attack, or any attack that does over 110 damage basically. If worst comes to
worst, use one, but don't do it the moment you start your battle. Bolt Breath
and his regular "Fight" attack are the only moves World Wyrm seems to use, so
very long range attacks are reommended here also. You might have to revive
characters a couple of times, but aside from that this is an easy battle.

Black Mage lv. 31
Thief lv. 32

Wow... that moogle is so mean... yeah this is a trap. God, how cruel. I can't
stand it... oh yeah the guide. First the enemies. The Mog Knight is at a nice
level of 34, so make sure you're around levels 33 or 34 before fighting. In
addition to Charge, the Mog Knight has Call and Counter. Its attacks consist of
Mog Attack, Mog Rush (All or nothing attack), and Mog Aid. It also has 100% Wool
(that's an attack), Tail Wag, and Friend. Don't take the nice, cute names for
granted though; this guy is dangerous, and you should take him out as soon as
possible. The Time Mage has many abilities. It knows Time Magic, Black Magic,
Return Magic (if you do a magic attack at it, it'll do the same one right back),
and Geomancy.

His attacks consist of Haste, Slow, Silence, and Demi. Demi is the only major
threat of these three, due to the fact that your HP is reduced by half. The
Juggler knows, in addition to Stunt, Call and Last Haste. Its attacks consist of
Hurl, which attacks with a thrown items, Ring, Ball, and Smile. It also knows
the attacks 100% Wool and Tail Wag. The Black Mage knows, in addition to Black
Magic, Call and Return Magic. Its attack are super strong. They consist of
Firaga, Thundaga, and Blizzaga which can all deal 100+ damage (not to mention
it's a target area attack!). It also knows Chocobo Rush, Frogsong, and Friend.
Chocobo Rush and Frogsong are very dangerous attacks, so you sohould watch out
for them.

Now for a strategy. Your first target should definitely be the Mog Knight, due
to the power of its attacks. It should only take about a turn to defeat them if
you have the right equipment and are at a high level. You should go for the
Black Mage next, because of its three Black Magic attacks. I'm assuming you have
a Heavy Damage attack, because you should've gotten one at this point in the
game. Next go for the Time Mage, since its Black Magic attacks are also very
powerful. The Juggler should go last, since it isn't that powerful at all. If
you are at the right levels and have some strong moves, this is a very easy
battle.

This is a difficult match due to the power of the clan you're fighting. I
suggest you wait until you are at a level of at least 37 or so. You can try
lower if you have some Heavy and Ultima damage attacks though. The battle arena
is quite strange.

The enemies are all spread out in the middle of the arena. Except for two flower
patches and some cones on the edges of the arena, there aren't any obstacles.
There's a big space in the middle which should be more than enough to fight this
group [watch out of the tiny pond of water (looks like an L) covering three
squares]. The group has some nice abilities. The Fes Boss has White Magic, Last
Haste, and Shieldbearer. It has, fortunately, no moves that revive a character
but it does have Curaga, Esuna, and two others that aren't really a threat
(Shell and Protect). Curaga is really the only one you have to worry about, but
Esuna can be annoying also if you are using moves to affect the enemy's stats.

The Kagle Boss has powerful abilities. In addition to Weapon Def+, it has Drain,
which sucks out HP of you unit and heals the attacker; Blind, which blinds the
unit; Water, which does some decent damage; Aero, and Giga Flare, which is a
heavy damage attack that can be very dangerous. Finally, it has Bio, which is
also a dangerous attack. The Hel Boss has Half MP, and her powerful Summon Magic
consists of Unicorn, Kirin, Carbuncle, and Madeen (be very thankful she doesn't
know Doublecast!). The Ba Boss is also very dangerous. It has the support
ability of Weapon Def+, and its attacks are Drop Weapon, which forces you to
drop your weapon and waste a turn getting it back out; Saint Cross, which is a
target area holy damage attack; and Holy Blade, which is a very powerful holy
damage attack.

The Gelm Boss knows Doublehand, and its Monk Techs consist of Whirlwind, Air
Render, Earth Render, Far Fist, and Chakra. You'll most definetily need six of
your most powerful units here and they should have high attack and defense. The
enemy units have a good move range so they can get up to attacking you quickly.
You'll REALLY want the move Double Sword here, which allows you to weild two
swords at once. If you have that and a Paladin with SaveTheQueen and Excalibur,
it'll REALLY weigh the odds in your favor! Beware of Bio, since it damages for
MAJOR hit points and poisons. Full-life is a MUST here. Also, if you have any
attacks that doom a unit, use it! Go for the Paladin first, due to the Holy
Blade attack. It can deal around 250 damage to you, which can be more than
enough to KO sometimes.

If you stay alive and let the Doom attacks take care of the enemies, this battle
may not turn out to be so hard!

good abilities up her... uh... forget it. Anyway, Block Arrows is one of them
and Weapon Atk+ is another. She also has Twister and Kiss which seems to be her
only two attacks. The battle arena is nothing special it is a square with a
bunch of wooden decks scattered around it and some flagpoles around the edges.
The Inverlilth will be in the north, at the center of the area and you'll start
down at the center of the south area. Surprisingly, you can bring out four
people here (I thought it would only be two or three people), so take out your
strongest.

on the left knows Weapon Atk+ and the Jelly behind it has Counter and Weapon

block your arrows and knows Weapon Atk+. The Jelly on the right knows Weapon

Um... what's wrong with this picture. Seriously, that kid's an idiot trying to

size for fighting only just one enemy uint. There are no obstacles except for
two trees on each side in the midde of the arena. The Jawbreaker also doesn't
have that many abilities; only two, which are Block Arrows and Weapon Atk+. You
can bring in four units to fight the Jawbreaker, but that's more than enough.
Your characters should be strong enough by now to take out the enemy in one
turn, maybe even less. His attacks are strong at least. They deal around 125
points of damage, so you guys should be kneeling, but since he only gets one
turn before your units go, you can take him out the second turn if he hasn't
gone yet.

No offense to whoever requested this mission, but what kind of a guy has a

note, how are we supposed to give Carrot back if we're fighting in a JAGD? Oh
well. Anyway, our buddy Carrot here is the only enemy you'll have to fight.
That's good too, since Carrot has around 530 HP and is very powerful. It knows
the Action ability Stentch, and it has Counter and Weapon Def+. It knows Bad
Breath and Goo, which are its only attacks. Bad Breath is VERY dangerous, since
it causes multiple random status ailments. Due to the fact that Carrot has some
high er... EVERYTHING, you'll want to bring along a character that knows Double
Sword and Demi. Use Demi on Carrot first to half his HP, then use Double Sword
to finish him off.

It's also a good idea to do a multi-character combo. Those things can cause some
major damage. Anyway, Carrot can be very easy if you bring along characters that
excel in attack and defense.

Assassin lv. 41
Assassin lv. 39
Ninja lv. 38

This is easily one of the hardest clans you're ever going to have to fight.
Sucks that it's in a jagd doesn't it? Good thing is, you only have to defeat
Hanzou. But you're going to have to fight your way through everyone else, and
they are very, very strong. They are also all very fast so you'll probably have
to wait for all of them to move and attack before you can go. You really need to
bring along lots of healing items here, due to the fact that they all have very
strong attacks. Hanzou has the Reaction ability Auto-Regen and the Support
ability Turbo MP, which makes his magic attacks very strong. He has two powerful
Action abilities: Ninja Skill and Phantasm Skill. His only Ninja Skill consists
of Throw, but he has many Phantasm Skills.

He knows Prominence, Tempest, Freezeblink, Deluge, Soil Evidence, and Wild
Tornado. The level 41 Ninja has the super-dangerous Support abilitiy Double
Sword. He also has Ninja Skills and Blue Mage Skills. His only Ninja Skill is,
like Hanzos, Throw but he he has many Blue Mage skills. Blowup, Night, Twister,
Poison Claw, Stare, and Immunity are the Blue Magic attacks that he knows.
Blowup is a suicide attack, but it causes major damage and Night targets every
unit in the arena and puts them all to sleep, so it can be helpful and it can be
hell. Also, Twister is very dangerous because it's a Target Area attack that
halves HP.

Now for the level 41 Assassin. She knows Return Fire, so don't bother trying to
shoot arrows at her. She also has two Action abilities: Corner and Sharpshoot.
Her Corner abilities are Rockseal and Oblivion, and her Sniper abilities are
Aim: Armor, Aim: Weapon, and Aim: Wallet. If you have valuable weapons and armor
on your characters, take this Assassin out as soon as you get the chance to. The
level 39 Assassin also knows Corner and Sharpshoot. Her Corner abilities are
Shadowbind, Last Breath, Nightmare, and Ague. Her Sniper abilities are
Doubleshot, Beso Toxico, and Death Sickle. Doubleshot allows her to fire two
arrows, Beso Toxico is a high damaging attack that poisons, and Death Sickle
dooms your character.

Finally, the level 38 Ninja. He knows Counter and Double Sword, which means he
can counter with two sword slashes. If you have an attack that can destroy the
Ninja's weapons, do so. He only has Ninja Skills, and they are Wood Veil, Fire
Veil, Unspell, and Oblivion. Bring along characters with very high damaging
attacks, or instant KO attacks. Alchemists and Summoners with Doublecast are
good. You shouldn't focus on any of the units other than Honzou, unless you want
the experience points. Hanzo is way in the back of the area, so it might take a
turn or two to get to him. Use Quicken on your units to reach him faster. If you
know Double Sword, you might be able to take him out in a turn.

Gagat: Bladesmith lv. 49

Whew! Level 49! That is VERY strong. Luckily, you are only fighting Gagat and
you can bring out four clan members. You MUST have a very high damaging attack
here, or an instant KO move. I suggest bringing along characters who know Death
or Last Breath, which instantly KOs and does major damage respectively. Also, a
powerful Summoner with Doublecast isn't bad, since you can cast two summons on
Gagat. Once again, a good character to bring along would be a Paladin with
Double Sword. If you equip strong weapons on the Paladin, each hit can deal
around 175 damage! Okay, the Bladesmith knows two Action abilities: Spellblade
Tech and Dragon Tech. He also knows Counter, which is bad due to the fact that
he's so powerful. If you can steal his weapon or destroy it, do so to reduce his
power.

He has the Support ability Doublehand. His Spellblade Techs consist of Fire
Sword, Bolt Sword, and Ice Sword. His only Dragon Tech is a powerful one:
Lancet. Okay so if you bring along any of the characters that I suggested, this
battle instantly becomes a whole lot easier. If you have a Time Mage that knows
Quicken, use it on your strongest character so they can go and damage Gagat.
Gagat is fast so it's likely that he'll go after your first unit does. If his
weapon is already destroyed, you don't need to worry about him that mcuh.

you), Aim: Arm (disables you), and Cupid. The White Mage knows only White Magic,
and his three moves are Cure, Esuna (the only real danger), and Protect. The
Thief knows Counter, and his moves are Steal: Shield, Steal: Gil, Steal: EXP,
and Steal: JP. The Black Mage has no additional abilities, and it has only Fire,
Thunder, and Blizzard.

Finally, the Warrior knows Monkey Grip, and his attacking abilities consist of
Powerbreak, Mindbreak, Body Slam, and Greased Bolt. You'll want to go for the
Black Mage first, and then the Warrior, since they both have some good attacks.
The Archer should go next, and then the White Mage. Save the thief for last,
since he is no real threat.

Firewyrm lv. 19
Thundrake lv. 20
Thundrake lv 21

There are five Wyrms here, and you should be at least level 25, so this battle
should be very simple (not for me, I fought in a Jagd!). The Icedrake has no
extra abilities and only two attacks: Mighty Guard and Ice Breath, which is a
powerful ice attack. The Firewyrm knows Weapon Atk+, and its attacks consist of
Guard-Off and Fire Breath. The other Firewyrm (the one at level 19) also has
Weaopn Atk+, but its only attack is Guard-Off. The first of the two Thundrakes,
the one at level 20, knows Geomancy, has only two attacks: Dragon Force and Bolt
Breath. The second of the two (the one at level 21), also knows Geomancy and has
only Dragon Force as an attack. You should go for the two Firewryms first. Try
to get them near each other, then do an attack like Blizzaga.

Watch out for their regular attack, since it is very powerful. Getting rid of
the Firewyrms should take, at the max, two turns. Then focus you attacks on the
Icedrake, by using things such as Firaga. Turn your attention to the Thundrakes
last, since there isn't any specific move that'll greatly weaken them. Taking
out the Thundrakes should take about two turns each. If you keep your units
alive, you can end the battle quickly and easily.

Juggler lv. 22

If you want, you can be a nice guy and trade silvril for 10,000 gil. That's what
I'd do (but I didn't so I could write this). If you just take it, then you'll be
forced to engage! Okay if you decided to be really cruel and ambush the old nu
mou, here's how to beat them. First off, the Sage knows Weapon Def+ and his
attacks are Water, Aero, Raise (it heals HP AND revives), Giga Flare (Heavy
damage, target area attack), Bio, and Reflex. The Fencer's attacks consist of
both Luge Techs and Spirit Magic. SHe also has Magic Pow+. The four she has are
Shallowtail, Piercethrough, Nighthawk, and Reflex. Her Spirit Magic attacks are
Earth Heal and White Flame. The Illusionist can absorb your magic, and she also
has Half MP.

Her target all attacks are Star Cross, Stardust, Soil Evidence, and Wild
Tornado. The Juggler knows Return Fire and Concentrate, and its attacks consist
of Hurl, which throws an item at you, Ring, Firebomb, Ball, Dagger, which
damages and disables, and Smile. You should be at least level 25 when you fight
these guys so the battle should be quick. Go for the Illusionist first, since
the target all attacks she has can be dangerous. Your next goal should be the
Sage, due to Raise and Giga Flare. The next two can be defeated in any order
since none of them have too much power. Try to get them close together so you
can do some good target area damage on them. Their HP is moderate, so if you are
above at least level 26, some of your attacks will be able to one-hit KO them.

Well you can let the guy go and get 2000 gil to clear the mission, but hey,
stealing's a bad thing so I just fought him and you should too. It's not like
it's gonna be hard. Heh. The guy that stole the scoop is a Thief. Go figure. His
attacks consist of Steal: Gil, Steal: EXP, and Steal: JP. He also has the
ability to use items and counter. The Fencer knows no Reaction or Support
abilities, but her attacks are strong: Shallowtail, which slows you down,
Piercethrough, which has a two-square range and can go through any obstacle, and
Nighthawk, which is simply a damaging attack. The Soldier has Weapon Def+, and
it also has First Aid (which heals the user, but not by much), Mug (it steals
gil and damages), and Provoke.

The White Monk knows Counter, and he also has Earth Render, Chakra, Revive (the
name says it all, unfortunately), and Holy Sign (this is powerful). Finally, the
moggle thief (also at level 20), can use items, but konws no Reaction or Support
abilities. It has Steal: Shield, Steal: Access. (that steals accessorys), Steal:
Helm, and Steal: Gil. The White Monk needs to go first due to revive and Holy
Sign. After that, go for the Soldier, and then the Fencer. I'd go for the human
thief first, since it is more powerful than the moogle, but then again, the
moogle can steal your shield and your helm, which seriously drops defense. Get
bunches of the enemies in groups to attack. If you have heavy damage, use it!
Don't use totemas here if you have them, since they aren't needed.

Ummm... what's with the jumping boxes? Yeah weird but hey, this is Final
Fantasy. Anyway, it's an encounter mission so I can't describe the battle arena.
These guys are relatively easy if you are around at least level 20. The level 19
Hunter knows Weapon Atk+, and its Hunt attacks are Sonic Boom, AIm: Vitals, and
Addle. The Beastmaster knows Geomancy, and the two control techniques it knows
are Bomb and Malboro. The level 18 Malboro knows Counter and its two attacks
consist of Bad Breath and Goo. The level 17 Malboro knows the same things
(Counter, Bad Breath, and Goo). The Mystery Boxes have nothing because
they're... well, a freakin box what do you expect? Go for the Hunter first,
since he seems to be the most powerful one.

Save the Mystery Boxes for last due to the fact that they are, again, a stupid
box. After you defeat the Hunter, go for the Beastmaster. It has two powerful
attacks that you need to watch out for. It doesn't really matter in what order
you defeat the two Malboros, just go to whoever is closest at first. You don't
need totemas here; everybody can be easily defeated without them if you just
keep all your characters alive and use strong attacks and abilities, especially
heavy damage and target area ones.

Blade Biter lv. 25
Antlion lv. 21
Bomb lv. 22

You can give a blue flower to the clan, but I doubt you'll have one so you will
probably be forced to fight. Okay... You can bring in a whopping amount of two
people! But I guess that's okay since Ritz and Shara and two other of Clan
Ritz's members are helping... fine that comes to six, sue me. The Blade Biter is
the most dangerous, and I suggest you eliminate it first. It has the Block
Arrows ability and Weapon + which increases his weapon power. The Bomb knows
counter, but it only hits for around 30 points of damage. The Antlion also knows
Counter and Weapon Def+. Those are the only three enemies you're against, and if
you take out the Blade Biter first, it becomes as easy as one of the early
missions (around the single diget missions).

The Blade Biter's main attack is Crush, which hits for around 110 points of
damage. A white mage is not needed here, since Clan Ritz has one. I suggest a
Black Mage in addition to Marche is good, since a regular fight attack against
the Blade Biter does a whopping point of damage. Ritz, Shara, and the other two
clan members will do most of the work for you. Ritz knows heavy dust, which can
damage and make units unable to move, and she'll use that often. Ritz also knows
Absorb MP, so you can heal her with your Black Mage if she's in trouble. Aside
from those tips, just use your best moves to easily win.

If I were you, I'd buy the skin and then realize how stupid that was due to the
fact that you instantly fail the mission. So instead, choose to destroy the dude
for hurting endangered animals (idiot). Okay, due to the fact that this is an
encounter mission, I can't describe the battle arena. I'll just skip right to
the abilities. The level 17 Hunter knows Auto-Regen and Weapon Atk+, two good
abilities. His hunt moves consist of Sonic Boom and Advice (nothing else). The
human Archer is able to block all arrows and he knows Concentrate. He has three
good moves which consist of Aim: Legs (immobilizes you), Aim: Arm (disables you)
and Cupid (charms your units to attack only their allies). If he uses both Aim:
Legs and Aim: Arm on you, you're as good as dead, so pray that he doesn't.

The level 14 Hunter also knows Auto-Regen and Weapon Atk+. His attacks are also
the same as the other Hunter: Sonic Boom and Advice. The viera Archer can block
arrows and she knows Concentrate. Her moves are also the same as the human's
moves: Aim: Legs, Aim: Arm, and Cupid. The level 13 Gunner knows Last Haste as
well as Concentrate. Its Gunmanship abilities consist of Confushot, Charmshot,
Blindshot, and Silenshot. Charmshot is the only big thing out of the four, the
others you don't need to worry about as much. Finally, the level 15 Gunner knows
the exact same moves and abilities as the level 13 Gunner. I'd go for the Hunter
(level 17) first since it is the most powerful. After he's dead go for the human
Archer.

Next, go for the level 14 Hunter, and then the viera Archer. Finally, go for the
level 15 and 13 Gunners (in that order). None of them have any attacks you need
to dreadfully worry about, so just stick to your strongest attacks to win.

Sprite lv. 17
Grendade lv. 12
Ice Flan lv. 13

This is an easy battle, but make sure Dmg2: Animal isn't activated since you're
fighting three animal units. The Sprite has Counter in addition to Trick, and
its Trick moves consist of only White Wind. The Grenade knows, in addition to
Boom!, Weapon Atk+. The two Boom! attacks are Blowup, which KOs the user but
causes major damage, and Chill. Finally, the Ice Flan knows only Chill, and its
two chill attacks are Acid and Blizzard. Their HP vairies dramatically, but the
Sprite is at the highest level and has around 90 HP, so it should only take a
turn to defeat her. She's fast, so she'll probably go first. The Grendade has
decent speed, but its attacks aren't that great. It can heal itself with Chill
though, so be careful.

The Ice Flan's Blizzard move is decent, but remember that it's a target area.
Also keep in mind that the Ice Flan almost always dies in one hit from a fire
attack, so use those if you have them.

Joy for you having to defeat only the boss here. This is quite a simple battle.
You should be around level 18 minimum when this appears and everyone you're
facing is a much lower level. There's Weaver, who knows Weapon Atk. + and has
Fighter Techs consisting of Beatdown, Air Render, Far Fist, and Backdraft.
Beatdown can be dangerous, so make sure your units have strong defense. The
other Fighter knows only the action abliity Fighter Tech, and his three attacks
are Rush, Wild Swing, and Blitz. The Archer has the reacton ablity Block Arrows,
and he has some good attacks. Boost, Aim: Legs, Aim: Arm, and Take Aim. Avoid
him, and if you have a unit that can block arrows, bring it out due to the fact
that he can disable you completely.

The Gladiator knows Beatdown and three Sword moves: Fire Sword, Bolt Sword, and
Ice Sword. Finally, the Black Mage has the support abliity Geomancy, and it
knows all level one and two Fire, Thunder, and Ice moves (so it knows Fira,
Thundara, and Blizzara in addition to Fire, Thunder, and Ice). Since you only
have to defeat Weaver, this should be a very easy battle. Get a couple of units
to surround him and then use a group comob on him to take him out in one hit. If
you don't have multiple units with combos (although you should by now) just use
regular "Fight" attacks to defeat him.

Soldier lv. 14

You can try to explain but I think you'll have to fight anyway. I dunno. Maybe
you have to have a high negotiation level. Anyway, I suggest you fight for the
AP and EXP. It is a REALLY easy battle anyway. You are against five low level
people and your units should have hit around level 20 by now. The majority of
you attacks can do around 90 points of damage, so this battle can last a turn if
you are strong enough. (I was at level 25 when I did this, but it appeared when
I was around level 22.) I can't tell you what the battle arena looks like
because you will be traveling. I can tell you the abilities of the enemy units.
The warrior has nothing additional except for Monkey Grip. The Animist can Block
Arrows, so don't send your archer to attack him.

The gunner can concentrate, and so can the archer. The soldier has Weapon Def+
which will raise Weapon Defense (duh). An archer should be here, as well as a
Black Mage, but I doubt a White Mage will be needed. Bring one out anyway, just
for emergencies. Color magic is highly recommended, since it can one-hit KO
multiple enemy units at once. Aside from that, there isn't really anything else
I can say except for don't slack and obey the law.

You can join Clan Baham, but'll it will change your clan title. I refused this
offer due to the fact that "Clan Weasel" is the best clan name there is.
Besides, theres AP and EXP to be earned! If you want to change your clan title
then select "Join Clan Baham". Otherwise, Engage! This should be one of your
first Encounter missions you see. When you select it, make sure you are at or
above level 10 [I was at level 23 so that sort of dropped their chances :)].
Anywayy, you should still have some strong attacks at level ten. Black Mage
powers like Fire, Ice, and Thunder are good, but if you have any higher level B.
Mage powers at that point, they are good also.

The level 9 Soldier knows Weapon Atk+ (raises Weapon Atk) while the Archer knows
Concentrate. The Black Mage knows nothing other than Black Magic and the Thief
can't do anything but Steal. The White Mage also can't do anything but White
Magic. Since you should be a couple levels higher than them and since they have
almost no extra abilities, this battle will be super easy.

This is what happens once you clear all 300 missions:

Head to Bervenia Palace. Cid will be looking out of a window, and a Ninja will
knock. He'll tell Cid that he's reporting. Cid will ask if he found any proof of
corruption and the Ninja will shake his head and comment that whoever was
responsible is very good at covering up. He'll say that it's hard to catch a
judge who doesn't want to be found. Cid will say that the split from the palace
is a two-edged sword and that it's his responsibility. The Ninja will mumble
Cid's name and Cid will walk a few steps. He'll say that if their resources are
at their limits and the Ninja will interrupt and comment on the clans. Cid will
say that the clans are the ones most affected by the corrupt judges' actions.
He'll then comment that the clans should be willing to help.

The Ninja will ask Cid if they could trust the clans, and then he'll say that
it's a possibility that the judges might bribe them. Cid will tell the Ninja not
to worry because there is one clan that they can trust (can you guess?). The
screen will fade... Then go to the pub and select "Cleanup Time", which will be
there. Complete it...

Glad to know that there are more than 300 missions. Okay, when you start, you'll
see a judge talking to a human. The judge will tell the human that he bestows
him with "justice" which is the red card immunity (the little medal). Suddenly,
a voice will ask what the judge is doing, and that the judge pleged to defend
the law. Cid will walk out, and the judge will tell Cid that he's done nothing.
He'll say that he was just passing judgement on the human near him. Cid will ask
the human if it's true, and the human is... Marche! Marche will say that he was
about to give him immunity to red cards. Cid will tell the judge that giving out
immunity on your own is illegal. Marche will say that he was asked to root out
corruption, and the request came from an official at the JudgeWatch board. The
judge will finally figure out that Marche and Cid were in this trap together.
Smart guy -_-

Cid will say that it's true, and that his checkers were unable to catch judges
like the one who was giving out justice. He'll say that he had to go to clans
for assistance and the judge will get really pissed. Cid will say that he will
take the "curses" as an admission of guilt and will remind the judge that he'll
be punished. The judge will blow his whistle and a bunch of units will appear.
Cid will ask the judge if that's his answer and then Cid will take out a sword.
Cid will then tell Marche that he'll be fighting alongside him. The judge will
laugh, and tell Cid that he hopes he can follow the law. Cid will tell him that
of course he can, and that he expects to be judged fairly.

------
Fight!
------
These guys are all at level 36 (except for one at 37). You've completed all 300
missions, so you should be at what is easily level 50. Judgemaster Cid is at
level 37 (faints) and he is VERY cool. He has the Advanced Law techniques, which
I'll explain after the battle (you get to play as him, remember?) So anyway,
these guys should be pathetically easy. The Warrior knows both Battle Techs and
Monk Techs, as well as Counter and Weapon Atk+. His Battle Techs are Body Slam
and Greased Bolt, and his Monk Tehcs are Whirlwind, Air Render, and Chakra. Air
Render is somewhat powerful, but the others you don't really have to worry
about. Body Slam can do the most damage, but it also damages the attacker. The
Defender knows Weapon Def+,  and his Defend techs are Tremor, Defense, Mow Down,
and Aura.

The Sage is able to use items, and it knows Return Magic and Half MP. His
attacks are Drain, Blind, Raise, and Bio. Okay, again you've cleared all 300
missions and this guy doesn't even have a heavy damage attack? Square-Enix
must've been drunk when they were creating this battle or something, these guys
are POWERLESS! Anyway, Raise can revive and heal HP, so be careful. The Templar
knows Last Berserk, and his Sacred Techs are Warcry, Rasp, Cheer, and Lifebreak.
Now for the Time Mage. He can use Black Magic as well as Time Magic, and knows
Last Haste and Maintenance. His Time Magic consists of Quicken, Slow, and Stop.
Stop is very dangerous, and Qucken can be annoying. He also knows Firaga and
Blizzaga.

Cid is amazing. He has super high HP and defense, and supercool attacks. The
guys that you fight aren't that hard. You'll do most of the work because Cid
will not do that much until you get him near some enemies. They aren't that
hard. You should have Ultima by now, so just use it against the enemies to take
them out in a single blow.
---------

The judge will back up, and Cid will tell the judge that they have absolute
power, and that the power shouldn't be abused. Cid will ask the judge if he
understands the consequences and the judge won't say anything. Cid will raise an
invisible card and the judge will disappear. Cid will then thank Marche for his
help and Marche will say on how he's glad that they were able to catch the
rotton judge. Cid will agree, but he'll also comment that there's probably more.
He'll talk to Marche about the split, and Marche will say that without the
ordering force of the palace, the judges have more power. Cid will say how they
could montier cities, but not outlaying areas. He'll then wish that he could
patrol himself. Marche will ask if there is anything he could do and Cid will
think.

He'll then ask Marche if he could join his clan. Marche will be shocked, and Cid
will explain that joining a clan would be a perfect way to monitor the country.
He'll say how he could devote himself into the task. Marche will agree and then
Cid will ask if it could be just until he's completed his survey. His status
will pop up...

If you refuse Judgemaster Cid, you're a freaking idiot.

Marche will welcome Cid and Cid will say that he's in Marche's hands. He'll ask
Marche to treat him as any other new recruit. Marche will comment on how it'd be
hard to give orders to the judgemaster. Cid will comment on how he'll do his
best so Marche won't have to give that many orders.

Go and accept "No Arms Rule". Then...

Head to a town (I went to Sprohm), and you'll see Babus walking back and forth.
He'll be muttering something about alta orran, and then he'll say that that
wasn't it. A voice will ask Babus if he's trying to cast spells. Cid will appear
and Babus will say that it wasn't a spell, but something stuck in his head.
He'll say that he couldn't remember where he heard it from. Then he'll suddenly
realize that Mewt kept saying it to himself: Alta Oron Sondus Kameela. Babus
will say that at the time, it sounded like some ancient spell. Cid will ask what
the words mean and Babus will say that he doesn't know. He'll say that ancient
tongues placed a lot of value on sounds, and good sounds often mean good things.
Cid will wonder if Mewt knows what the words mean. He'll then say that it's
strange that he knows such a thing at all.

Cid will then ask Babus what he was doing here. Babus will say that he was just
spending the day here. Cid will comment on how that's good, because Babus always
worked too hard for his age. Babus will thank Cid and then Cid will tell Babus
that it wasn't a compliment. Cid will then say that he worked so hard, no one
could slack. Babus will get very serious and apologize and Cid will laugh and
tell Babus that he was joking. Babus will say how he's never been good with
jokes. Cid will remind Babus that he's the personal mage to the prince, and
Babus will fall silent. The screen will fade...

Official lv. 38
Paladin lv. 38
Bishop lv. 38
Time Mage lv. 37
Black Mage lv. 36

Corrupt officials this time! Collecting weapons! Anyway, it's pretty sad that
these guys are only at level 38. Okay, the corrupt official knows Phantasm
Skills and a single move that falls under the expert category called Blank Card.
She all can absorb magic and she has the support ability Half MP. Her many
Illusionist abilities consist of Stardust, Deluge, Soil Evidence, and Wild
Tornado. The Paladin konws Chivalry and Battle Techs, as well as Counter and
Shieldbearer. His only two Chivalry techniques are Cover and Holy Blade. Holy
Blade is very powerful, and you'll want to make sure your units have high weapon
defense. His only Soldier abilitiy is Speedbreak. The Bishop has only one Action
ability, no Reaction abilities, and his support abilitiy is Weaopon Defense+.

His four Prayer moves are Dispel, Barrier, Judge, and Break. The Time Mage is
able to use items, and he knows Auto-Regen. Luckily, he doesn't know Stop, but
he does know Haste and Quicken, two moves that can't HURT your clan, but they
can be extremely annoying. He also knows Slow, another irritating move, and
Silence. Finally, the Black Mage is able to use both Black and White magic, and
he knows Half MP. His Black Magic consists of Fira, Thundara, and Blizzara, and
his White Mage moves are Cura and Esuna. So here's your first chance to try out
Judgemaster Cid! You'll find him to be a very cool dude who can nullify yellow
cards, steal JP while damaging, make a Judge skip a turn, and he has really high
HP and Defense.

Basically, your characters are never going to prison again because of this guy.
Cool, isn't it? He can also give cards to enemies. Now THAT'S cool. Can't argue
with that. Okay, first off, you'll want to freeze the judge with Cid if there is
something forbidden that puts you at a big disatvantage. Remember that the judge
only skips a single turn, so don't hesitate to use your moves. You'll want to
take out the Official first because she is easily the most powerful. The Paladin
comes in second. He has high attack and his Holy Blade is the MOST. ANNOYING.
THING. EVAR. The Time Mage needs to go next, because Quicken, Haste, and Slow
can really piss you off. You notice I haven't said White Mage yet, which is
rare.

The White Mage doesn't heal THAT much HP, so it really isn't a problem. Still,
take him out next. You should use summons to take everyone out at once, since it
has a super long range.

White Monk lv. 37
Gladiator lv. 36
Archer lv. 36

A kissing law? What the hell will they think of next? Anyway, this is a slight
bit tougher than the last battle, but not by much. Again, low levels here, and
all people should now be at level 50 (except for Judgemaster Cid, who should be
around 42 or 43). The Official also knows Blank Card, and his Hunt moves are
Sonic Boom, Aim: Vitals, and (OMGWTFLOL) Ultima Shot. Yeah, your worst nightmare
come true. A long range ultima attack used against you. Ouch. Anyway, he also
knows Last Haste, so make sure you take him out in one blow if you don't want
him to speed up, and he knows Concentrate, so his Ultima Shot is a lot more
accruate. Crap. The Sniper knows Return Fire, so don't bother shooting any
arrows at her.

She also knows Sharpshoot and Lunge Techs. Her Sharpshoot abilities are
Doubleshot, Beso Toxico, Death Sickle, and Aim: Weapon. Those are all dangerous
attacks. Aim: Weapon can be a killer if you are using some of the powerful
weapons you got back in the "Blade" missions. I lost a Nagnarok to that piece of
crap. And Doubleshot, while the attack power lowers, still hits for more than a
normal "Fight" move would. The only good thing is that you don't suffer much
damage if you dodge one of the arrows. Death Sickle isn't really a problem,
since you'll probably end this battle in three turns anyway. And Beso Toxico
hits for high damage AND poisons you. Her only Lunge Tech move is Night Hawk.
Okay, now for the White Monk. Surprisingly, he doesn't have that much stuff.

He only has three weak things equipped, and knows only one action ability and a
reaction. Only problem is the reaction is Bonecrusher, and his attack is 406.
406 times 1.5 is... 609. So he'll hit you with a weapon attack power of 609.
Ouch. Use long range moves to get rid of that one. The Monk Techs he has are
Whirlwind, Air Render, Chakra, and Revive. Revive. Grrrr... The Gladiator also
doesn't know that much, except for Weapon Defense+ and Spellblade Techs. The
Spellblade Techs it konws are Rush, Wild Swing, Beatdown, and Blitz. Beatdown is
pretty dangerous, even though it's an all or nothing attack. If it hits, it'll
do high damage. Finally, the Archer. He knows Aim and Battle Tech abilities, and
has the Support ability Concentrate.

His Aim abilities are Aim: Legs, Cupid, Burial, and Concentrate. His Soldier
abilities are Powerbreak and Magicbreak. Okay, you probably have figured this
out by now, but in case you haven't, this is the thing you WANT BANNED:
Techniques. You'll disable everyone but the Official (not completely disable,
only some things), which will make the battle even easier than it already is.
You can ban missle, but it won't do anything to the Official since he has a
medal.
---------

When you try to leave Nubswood, and cinema scene will occur. You'll see a Nu Mou
standing in front of a regular judge. The Nu Mou will tell the judge that in the
last month, their income has gone up ten percent. He'll then say that the "blank
card" laws are to thank. The Nu Mou will also comment that he thinks the "seals
of immunity" are also helping. The judge will say that he likes the numbers, and
then he'll ask about other regions. The Nu Mou will say that they've spread to
all but a few certain areas. The judge will get angry and ask what the deal is
with "a few certain areas". The Nu Mou will take a small step forward and tell
the judge that it's only a rumor, but that people say that the Judgemaster is on
some kind of crackdown.

The judge will question what the Nu Mou just said, and the Nu Mou will say that
the judgemaster is using the clans to help him out. He'll say that Cid is
seizing immunity seals and blank cards. The Nu Mou will ask if they should
reduce the production of the seals. The judge will say that he sees no reason to
change the current operations as long as their secrecy remains uncompromised.
The Nu Mou will tell the judge that he understands. The Nu Mou will leave and
the judge will mutter how Cid is finally making his move. The screen will
fade...

running in. The Nu Mou will comment on how the "seal of immunity" was discovered
and that the judge must leave the area at once. Suddenly, Cid and Marche will
walk in. Cid will tell the judge that he was looking for him. Cid will ask the
judge if he was on his way somewhere just as he was arriving. The judge will
stutter that he didn't know Cid would come. The judge will then say that he'll
stay and then Cid will say that his search for a wanted criminal led him here.
Cid will comment on that he has to make a brief investigation. The judge will
fall silent.

Marche will turn to leave and then the judge will call out Cid's name. Marche
will turn and Cid will ask if there is a problem. Cid will ask the judge if he's
hiding any "seals of immunity". The judge will back away and admit to being
behind the seals. The judge will tell Cid that he must then die and then you'll
engage!

------
Fight!
------
Ah, finally! A battle against a corrupt judge itself! Nice! This is a very fun
battle because you're actually fighting a judge. The judge is freaking strong.
He has an Angel Ring, which grants him auto-life and he can withstand a number
of status ailments, and an Excalibur. He has one action ability: Judgement. It's
scary. He knows Judge Sword, just like Cid, Yellow Card *shiver*, and Palaistra.
The judge also already has reflect cast on him, so don't try to do any magic
unless you want it reflected right back at you! The two Sages are totally
different. The closest Sage to Cid knows White Magic in addition to Sagacity
Skills, and then he knows Weapon Defense+. His Sage abilities consist of Drain
and Blind.

Drain is annoying, and Blind can piss you off also since it dramatically lowers
your accuracy. The Sage farthest from Cid and closest to the Corrupt Judge is
EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. He knows Sagacity Skills and Time Magic, as well as Absorb
MP and Magic Power+. His three Sagacity Skills are Giga Flare (target-area heavy
damage), Bio, and Ultima Blow (That isn't good). His two Time Mage abilities
consist of Slow and Reflect. Don't let him slow you down, because it can really
mess you up. You'll want to bring out a couple of units who have ultima attacks.
An assassin with Ultima Masher is good, and then if you have any of the semi-
secret characters (you probably do by now), they all have Ultima already with
them.

The good thing here is that there are no laws, so there is nothing holding you
back. That means that some of Cid's abilities are useless though. The Corrupt
Judge will constantly use Judge Sword, so Cid should use Judge Sword on him to
get the stolen JP. Bring along a Summoner with Carbuncle, Unicorn, and Pheonix
to ensure some good safety. Just use Unicorn to heal and Pheonix to revive, and
you should be fine. Remember, DON'T focus on the Sages; focus only on the
corrupt judge and you'll do great.

Well, you're back to fighting officials agian. Damn, and that last mission was
so fun. Anyway, I think the "No Full HP" law is a little more original than the
past ones, don't you think? But that's not the point. I don't have a point.
Sorry, let's move on. Okay, the official only knows Blue Magic and Blank Card.
His Blue Magic is Magic Hammer, Mighty Guard, Matra Magic, and Bad Breath. Bad
Breath causes a number of random status ailments, and can be very annoying :(The
Lamia knows Counter, and its attacks are Night, Hand Slap, and Poison Frog. The
Lilith knows Weapon Attack+, and Twister, Poison Frog, and Kiss. Twister is a
target area that halves HP, so be careful. Fially, the Animist knows both Call
and Stunt abilities, as well as Catch. The Call abilities are Chocobo Rush and
Catnip, and the Stunt abilities are Ring and Dagger.

Unfortunately, there are no real laws that can make this battle easier. If you
bring along a Summoner who knows Carbuncle and use it on all of your untis, the
Blue Magic will have no effect on you, so the Official will be pretty much
totally disabled.

No reading and writing? Then WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING LOOK AT THIS FAQ? Okay,
sorry for the stupid joke, I couldn't resist. Anyway, these guys are, again,
easy. The Official is a Thief who knows Steal abilities and Blank Card, as well
as Reflex and Maintenance. The annoying abilitiy he has is Steal: Weapon, so
take him out as fast as possible. The Ninja has two swords: Osafune and Heaven's
Cloud so that means he has, you guessed it, Double Sword :( He is also able to
block arrows. The Templar isn't that dangerous at all, knowing only a few
attacks like Rasp, Soul Sphere, and Lifebreak. The Beastmaster knows Control,
which is pretty much no threat, but his Alchemist skills are hell. Astra, Death,
Meteor, and Toad. Death is quite accurate, so be careful.
The Red Panther can counter, and it knows Poison Claw. Its other attack, Rend,
isn't that powerful so don't worry. If I were you, I'd ban Techniques here to
prevent the Beastmaster from using Death. If that would disable you, then just
take out the Beastmaster or the Official first (which do you prefer; having a
weapon stolen for good, or a unit temporarily KOed?)
----------

When you try to leave, you'll see a cut scene of a bangaa reporting to a judge.
The judge will ask what's going on and the bangaa will say that they are
expecting a visit from the judgemaster soon. The judge will simply say, "I see."
The bangaa will tell the judge that Cyril's judge was sent to prison, and then
he'll ask the judge what he intends to do. The judge will turn and tell the
bangaa that he doesn't sell seals of immunity and that all he does is judge
engagements. The door will oppen and a viera will walk in. The viera will tell

Fight!

This is an easy battle. The judge knows the same techniques as the other judge
you fought, so he shouldn't be of any type of problem. You don't even have to
fight the other guys, so there's no worry there. They are all pretty weak
anyway. This is judge is, in a way, easier than the other because he doesn't
have an angel ring or reflect cast on him. It only took me one slash attack with
Marche, who was a Paladin with Double Sword and a Nagnarok/Excalibur2. Even if
you don't have those types of weapons, it should only take you about a turn to
defeat this guy. Use ultima damage often, and you should easily win this super
easy battle.

A relatively easy battle. You're fighting against another official and his
little allies here. The official knows Blank Card, just like all of the others.
But he also knows the dreaded skill Double Sword *shudder*, and he uses a
Masamune and a Zanmato for his two swords. He also knows Last Haste, so if
you're planning to take him out in more than one blow, make sure your first blow
doesn't make him critical. His Ninja skills consist of Throw, Fire Veil, Metal
Veil, Water Veil, and Oblivion. You don't need to worry much about the others,
since they aren't that powerful. If they prove to be too much of a nusiance,
then you can always take 'em out easily. Just focus mainly on the Official and
this battle should be over in a short amount of time.

Once you're done with the official, the rest are very easy.

Very easy battle, yet again. The official is a Black Mage, who knows Firaga,
Thundaga, and Blizzaga. Those are the three most powerful Black Magic spells, so
you should be on guard at all times. I suggest casting Carbuncle on your units
so they can't be hit by the spells. He also knows, like all others, Blank Card.
His reaction ability is Absorb MP and he has the support ability Gemonacy. The
others, while there are five others, don't pose much of a threat at all. If you
just take out the Official first, the others are very easy. It's just one of the
longer battles, that's all.
----------

Once you try to leave Roda, you'll see a cut scene of Cid, a Nu Mou, a human,
and a judge talking. Cid will tell the others that the judges in Cyril and
Baguba have been sent to prison because they were abusing their power as judges.
The judge will mention the "seals of immunity", "blank cards", and judicial
bribery. He'll then say that the split from the palace was supposed to be good,
but now corruption's worse than ever. The Nu Mou will say that the split from
the palace turned out to be an unwise decision. The judge will say that he
believed the judges should be separate from the palace, but that maybe the
timing was too soon.

The human will say that timing has nothing to do with what's going on, and that
it's simply a problem of the moral fiber of the corrupt judges. The nu mou will
be shocked that the human said that the judges are morally lacking. Cid will ask
the nu mou if he thinks their morals are in top shape. The judge will be shocked
and will ask Cid if he's admitting a personal failing. Cid will nod and say that
he feels responsible. He'll then say that he's prepared to resign once he
finishes his current survey. The judge will get REALLY shocked at this. Cid will
say that he has learned something already. It's that both judges that they have
captured were following orders from higher up. The human will say that it's
someone who knows the judges, the laws, and the prison.

Cid will say "If come acrosss any information" OMGWTFLOL they forgot to put the
"you" in there. Ha! Anyway, he'll ask the dudes to let him know if they come
across any information. The screen will fade...

There will be a scene of Cid, Marche, and a bangaa in the place where you did
the "Prison Break" mission. Cid will ask the bangaa what the source of all the
corruption is and the bangaa will back away. Cid will ask the bangaa if he
knows. The bangaa will say that it's the judge right in Sprohm. Marche will
excalim that it's the judge in charge of the prison, not willing to believe it.
Cid will ask the bangaa what the Sprohm judge wants. A disembodied voice will
answer, saying that he wants the rank of judgemaster. Three judges will walk
forward and Marche will repeat the Sprohm judge's answer. Cid will tell the
judges that he sees what they're trying to do.

He'll say that if judges everywhere are cheating, people will blaim it on him
[Cid]. Marche will be shocked that the judges are trying to force Judgemaster
Cid to resign. The Sprohm judge will say that he had no idea Cid was going to
resign anyway. Cid will excalim that he'd never pass his judge sword onto the
likes of the Sprohm judge. The Sprohm judge will tell Cid that he doesn't need
Cid to pass him anything, and that he'll just take it.

LOL! The judge's names are "Judge"! Ah, the irony. Anyway, no jump in difficulty
here, which is a shame. This is the final battle (literally), and it's extermely
fun. The judges simply know everything that all the other judges do, and it
isn't that hard. It is something for you to really enjoy though, so have fun!

When you purchase the mission, the screen will blacken and the you'll see Marche
talking to the pubmaster. The pubmaster will thank Marche and he'll say how hard
it is to find people for these snowy missions. Marche would say that's right,
because no one here would be used to snow. He'll then remember how scared he was
when he moved to a snowy area. The pubmaster will say that there is good news
though: there's hazard pay. Marche will nod and turn to leave and then Ritz will
run in and ask the pubmaster if the snow mission is still available. Marche will
ask what Ritz wants to know about the snow mission and Ritz will look at Marche
and she'll figure that he took it. She'll then say that that works out perfectly
and Ritz will ask if Marche wants to take her along.

Marche will say yes, but he'll also ask her why she wants to go so much. Ritz
will say that dead people in the snow intrigue her. Ritz will start to beg, and
she'll assure Marche that she won't get in his way. Marche will nod and say
that's fine, that they can go together (awww....). Ritz will thank Marche and
the pubmaster will warn them to watch themselves. They'll nod and leave...

When you enter Lutia Pass Marche will tell Ritz to look and three vampires will
appear.

------
Fight!
------
Since you have Ritz with you, you can only bring in two people in adition to
Marche. Ritz is at level 23, and she is a Fencer (even though she's human). One
of the vampires (the one at the right when you start) can block arrows, another
(the one in the back) doesn't have any additional abilities, and the one on the
left has Weapon Def+. Still, it should be a very easy battle for you since this
mission is only available after game completion so you should be at a level of
around 29 or 30. Ritz is at a lower level than she was when you fought her, but
her regular attack still does about 75 points of damage. The vampires can
respawn after three turns when you KO them, and you need to remember that. They
also know Miasma, which damages and poisons, and Lv S Flare, which is a killer
attack that does around 160 points of damage, and heals the vampires about 160
points!

That move can, of course, bring your untis down to their knees at once and if
the other vampires still have a turn waiting, they can KO your units. About five
Pheonix Downs a recommended here, and a couple of X-Potions but other than that,
you shouldn't need anything. Ritz will usually spread out her attacks instead of
focusing on only one vampire, but you should stick to one.

------------
After battle
------------
Ritz will give a scream of triuph saying that she and Marche won, and that the
snowball fight is over. Marche will ask Ritz when she said "Snowball Fight" what
did she mean. Ritz will explain that they were throwing snowballs and hurting
people and she'll ask if it reminded Marche of anything. Marche will realize
that it's Mewt and then Ritz will say that he's right. She'll also explain that
she isn't saying that the vampire's were Lyle's (the bully at the beginning of
the game) bunch, but when she saw the mission listed back at the pub, she just
had to take it. Marche will say that he wishes he could do the same back there
and Ritz will be confused. Marche will say that he means in the real world,
throwing the snowballs back at the bullies.

Ritz will say that he can, that it's easy. Marche will tell her that it never
seemed easy, but he guesses she's right. Ritz will then ask March if he wants
her to help out and Marche will ask help out with what. She'll say she means
with Marche's clan, that she'll join them. Marche will ask why all of a sudden
and Ritz will say why not. She'll say she thought it might be fun but if
Marche's got a problem with it, he can just let her know.

Now choose between yes or no. I chose yes (duh).

Umm... yeah why someone would hold a meeting in the woods is confusing beyond
reason, but oh well. Okay the two sides will be talking and Marche will say that
things seem to be going pretty well. Ezel will say that he hopes so and then one
side will ask the other if they'll sign the non-action treaty. The other side
will ask if they'll allow limmited use of antilaws and promise not to prosecute
ex-members of the resistance. The other side will nod and say that Bervinia
Palace agrees to both of those demands. Suddenly, someone will scream and five
people will appear on the other side. One of the enemy units will scream not to
listen to the palace, and that they're playing them for fools. He'll say that
the palace has only lied to them in the past, and that they shouldn't trust
them.

A judge will appear and Ezel will step forward. He'll say that trust or on
trust, they're here to get the treaty signed and that he'll stand witness to its
signing. The enemy unit will shout out that they'll bury them along with the
treaty.

BATTLE!
You can bring in four additional people to fight with Ezel and Marche. You'll
start on opposite sides of the arena, and this is bad for you, since the other
side has long range attacks. The battle arena is the perfet size, with the
center being the lowest, and the two ends being higher up. The enemy units have
many abilities. The Fighter is very, very dangerous. He has both Fighter
techniques AND Paladin techniques. He also can block arrows and he knows
Immunity. His attacks are dangerous. His fighter attacks are Beatdown, which
deals either VERY serious damage or none at all, and Blitz. His Paladin attacks
are a pain. He knows Cover, which shields one of his fellow units (he'll take
the damage instead of them).

He also knows Drop Weapon, which forces you to waste a turn drawing your weapon.
His major and most dangerous attack, however, is Holy Blade. This Holy attack
deals major damage and his Weapon Atk is already 417! The Elementalist behind
him is not as dangerous, but she is still powerful. She knows Auto-Regen, which
activates as soon as she is damaged, and she'll recover a bit of HP every turn
after that. Her attacks are Fire Whip, White Flame, and Evil Gaze. The White
Mage isn't powerful, but he is still a huge pain. He knows Weapon Def+, which
adds to is Weapon Def of 307, and his cure attacks consist of Cura, which heals
a ton of damage, Curaga, which heals a ****load of damage, Esuna which, as you
know, heals all status problems, and Auto-Life (AUGH!).

The White Monk knows both Monk Techs and Battle Techs, in addition to knowing a
powerful Counter and Weapon Def+. His attacks consist of Air Render, which is a
medium range, decent attack, Earth Render, which attacks in a straight line,
hurting everyone in its path, and Charkra. He also knows Body Slam which hurts
both the attacker and the user (although the user barely suffers), and Greased
Bolt. Finally, the Soldier has both Battle Techs and Steal abilities. His
Soldier abilities consist of First Aid, Provoke, and Shieldbearer, while his
Steal abilities are Steal: Helm, Steal: Weapon, and Steal: JP. Beware of Steal:
Weapon. You don't want to lose your weapon since it leaves you pretty much
hopeless when it comes to attacking.

The Fighter has a very big movement range, so he'll probably be able to attack
on his first turn. His regular attack alone does around 150 damage to your units
*shudder*. Remember, Fire Whipe damages and disables, so take out the
Elementalist soon. Still, you need to go for the Fighter first, since he is
very, very powerful. Go for the White Mage second, due to its healing powers,
and from there, it doesn't really matter. You might have to use a totema if
things get really tough, but try to avoid it. Ezel is pretty powerful. His Azoth
move is a target all, sleep move which can really come in handy. Once you have
the White Mage and Fighter taken out, this battle will be incredibly easy, and
then you get Ezel!

AFTER BATTLE...Ezel will ask if anymore people are hiding out in the woods and
he'll say that
one engagement a day is enough for him (but not for us...). Marche will say that
the coast is clear and Ezel will say that they should get on with the singing of
the treaty. The judge will speak, saying that may the words spoken here be
honored for all time. He'll turn to leave and the two sides will follow out.
Ezel will be glad that it's over and that his shoulders are stiff. Marche will
say that he's glad they managaed to make peace with the palace. Ezel will say
that it's going to mean more free time for him. Then Marche will ask why, and
Ezel will explain that Anitlaws are now legal, so he doesn't have to hide and
run. Marche will say how great that is and Ezel will say that he has to thank
Marche for it.

Marche will tell him not to mention it, and that he's now all embarressed. Ezel
will ask how he should pay him for helping out. Marche will say that he's fine
and that Ezel doesn't have to pay him. He'll say that he already got paid for
the mission anyway. Ezel will insist on giving Marche something after all.
Marche will think and then Ezel will say that he has a great gift: himself.
He'll say that he can join Marche's clan. Marche will be surprised at this and
ask Ezel if he's serious. Ezel will say that he'll be busy with his shop most
days, and that he can maybe be a kind of honorary memer. His stat screen will
pop up...

I said yes, so Ezel will say that he's reporting. Marche will welcome Ezel to
the clan and they'll turn to leave. Ezel will stop and tell Marche just one
thing. Marche will ask what it is and Ezel will tell Marche not to expect any
favors at the shop, and that business is business. Marche will understand and
they'll leave.

Doned. Doned will mention his name and Babus will ask who he is. The two people
behind Doned will walk away, and Doned will walk up to Babus and introduce
himself as Doned Radijiu, Marche's little brother. Doned will inform Babus that
Marche will be here soon and then Marche will walk in. Doned will call to him
and Marche will be surprised that Babus came all the way to Muscadet. He'll say
that he had some time on his hands and the three will walk down. Doned will ask
Marche how it went and Marche will mention that it's likely to be in Ambervale.
Babus will ask what and Marche will repeat that he hopes Babus finds whatever it
is that Mewt lost. Babus will ask if Marche wants to come along and Marche will
ask if Babus is sure of this.

Babus will tell him of course it's fine, and that it might be better for Marche
to go than him. Marche will ask why and Babus will tell him to forget that he
said anything. Babus will walk away and tell Marche to drop by if he feels like
going with Babus. He'll then thank Marche for finding the location and then
he'll leave. Doned will ask what Marche is going to do, and that he's curious to
find out what Mewt lost. Marche will tell Doned that he's also curious and the

When you enter Ambervale, you'll be in a different part than in the final three
battles. It's a cave, and Marche and Babus will enter. They'll stop and Marche
will ask Babus what Mewt left behind. Babus will hesitate and he'll turn away.
Marche will ask what, and Babus will tell Marche that he feels a strong force
that's magical and violent. Suddenly, the Fulfiller of Wishes will appear and
Babus will be shocked. Remedi will ask what Babus is doing here and Babus will
reply that he's looking for something Prince Mewt lost. Remedi will feel sorry
for Mewt because he's devoting himself to a dream, and then she'll inform Babus
that Mewt's long forgotten the Babus had ever existed. Babus will say that he
still follows Prince Mewt, that he'll always be loyal.

Babus will ask Remedi to please don't stop him from doing his sworn duty. Remedi
will ask what will happen if she stops him. Babus will simply tell her to not
forget, and Remedi will ask if he would really raise a sword against his queen.
Babus will say that he has no problem about fighting him, that she's a ghost and
that the real queen left with Mewt. The queen will bow her head and then two
additional enemy units will appear.

BATTLE!
You can only bring in two additional people, due to the fact that Marche and
Babus are helping you. Babus is at level 30 and he is quite strong. He has
Weapon Def+, and some great attacks. They are Explode, Stillness, Quarter and
Demi. He also has Counter, but it doesn't seem to be active in the battle. The
queen is not as strong as she was when you fought her for the first time. She is
now at level 28, whereas you should be around the 30s, and she has NO weapons
equipped, and knows NO abilities. That's it. She can only do a regular attack,
but it packs a hard hit, due to the fact that her Weapon Atk is 433. The Ahriman
(at a higher level then Remedi? Okay...) doesn't have that many attacks. It has
only one support and two action.

They are as follows: Roulette, which you should be used to by now (remember, it
is a random instant KO attack, which can be good and bad), and Circle. It also
knows Weapon Atk+, which adds to its 378 weapon atk stat. The Floateye seems to
like using its eye, since its only two action attacks are Stare and Devil Gaze.
It also has a powerful counter move. Since Babus will basically take care of the
Floateye and Ahriman, just focus on Remedi. She is at a serious disatvantage,
since she starts away from you and can only attack from a one square range. This
battle should be very simple if you stick to powerful long range attacks and let
Babus do the rest.
AFTER BATTLE...
The queen be kneeling and she'll transform into (>_<) a stuffed teddy bear
(>_<)! Marche will be surprised at this and Babus will say that this is what
Mewt forgot. Marche will say that the bear is proof the Mewt was in this world.
He'll say that it's all people they have to remember him by. Babus will be
silent and Marche will ask Babus if he's going to bring the bear back to his
palace room. Babus will say yes, that it belongs to the prince. Marche will tell
Babus that he's beent thinking about them maybe being friends. Babus will be
surprised at this and Marche will say that he knows they had their troubles in
the past, but now why not. Babus will say that he sees no reason to object and
his stat screen will come up.

Now you can select if you want Babus to join your party!

Babus will say that their friends (if you say yes), but not close friends. Fine,
you join Clan Nutsy but you aren't that much of Marche's friend. See if I care.

10 day dispatch mission. Once you complete it head to a town. There, you'll see
a cutscece with you and Shara. Shara will thank Marche and Marche will tell
shara that he had no idea she was here. Shara will say that she had no idea she
Marche was here and that she couldn't believe someone put up a notice at the
pub. Doned, who is sitting at a table, will tell Shara that she must've been
really screaming. Marche will be shocked that Doned said this. Marche will
apologize to Shara about Doned and explain that he's his brother. Shara will
shake her head and will say thathe's probably right, and that she though she was
going to lose her head. Marche will ask what was in the cave and Shara will fall
silent.

Marche will say that he understands if she doesn't want to talk about it. Shara
will say that it fell on her and Marche will be confused. She'll say that an
antlion larva fell right on her head. Doned will say that it's one of those big
white grubs as big as one's arm. Shara will scram and say to stop talking about
it, to not make her remember. Marche will exclaim that that must've been pretty
rough. Then he'll tell her she's safe now and that's what matters. Shara will
agree and thank Marche once more. Then Shara will say that she'll be getting
back and she'll turn to leave. Doned will jump up and tell Shara to wait. Then
he'll ask if she can help them. Marche will be confused. Doned will explain that
it's about Marche and Ritz and then _Shara_ will be confused.

Doned will say that they're both pretty bad at talking, and that he was
wondering if Shara could help Marche and Ritz out. Shara will say that she
wouldn't mind doing that, and then Doned will ask Marche if Shara can join the
clan. Her stat screen will pop up...

If you say yes (like I did), Shara will step forward and tell Marche to let her
know what he wants her to do. She'll say that she'll help whenever she's able
and Doned will exclaim how that's great. Marche will thank Shara and the screen

Now head to another town to see a cutscene with Shara and Ritz. Ritz will
exclaim that she's bushed and Shara will say that she [Ritz] was going all out
in "that engagement". She'll ask Ritz how many she KOed and Ritz will say that
they weren't much of a challenge. Shara will say that she's too good, and Ritz
will walk towards the table. Shara will ask Ritz what the problem is and Ritz
will tell Shara to be honest with her. Shara will ask what and Ritz will walk
away. She'll say that she isn't very cute and Shara will get _very_ confused at
this. Ritz will tell her that she says what she thinks all the time and that she
loves swinging her sword around in engagements. Shara and Ritz will both fall
silent.

The Shara will laugh and Ritz will get angry, because she's being serious.
She'll say that she doesn't the she fits the "cute" model at all. Shara will
tell Ritz to ask Marche what he thinks. Ritz will be shocked and say no, because
she doesn't think that Marche would care. Then Marche will appear and he'll call
to Ritz and Shara. Shara will tell Marche that he's here just at the right time.
Ritz will get angry at Shara and Marche will take a step back. Ritz will say
it's nothing and then she'll ask Marche what's up. Marche will exclaim that it's
nothing much and he'll take another step back. Shara will tell Ritz that she
can't leave Marche hanging like that and Ritz will say that she can. Then she'll
say sorry and say that it's really nothing at all.

Then she'll say that they should talk about the next mission. Marche will nod,
and Shara will shake her head. The screen will fade...

This is a tad bit harder than Pam Le Fey, but not by much. You don't want to
defeat Delusiah first, since it is able to revive in three turns. If you have a
Paladin, bring it out and use Holy Blade on it once everyone else is taken out.
For everyone else, you should just use dark magic. I recommend something like
Death since it is an instant KO move. If you don't have Death, then just use
powerful magic. Remember that these guys are immune to holy though (except for
Delusiah, who's weak against holy)!

Titania lv. 17

This will present some sort of a challenge to you. No one here knows any
reaction abilities, or second action abilties, and only Delusiah and the Titania
to the right of Delusiah know a support ability, and both of them are Weapon
Atk+. You should take out the two Titanias first, and then go for the
Masterberry. Beware of Knife, which saps 9/10 of your HP! If you don't have a
powerful character that can take Delusiah out in a single hit, then keep your
distance to avoid Knife.

By the time you clear mission 003, The Cheetahs, you should be at at least level
seven. So that means that even if you do this mission RIGHT after you beat
mission 003, you and your friend should have no trouble doing it. The Goblins
all know Counter, but that isn't a worry because Goblins are pretty weak. What
you want to do is bring a Summoner and use summon spells on the Goblins; they
have a huge attack range so you can easily hit all the Goblins at once. If you
don't have a Summoner, then use your most powerful target area color magic.

So this shouldn't be that much of a challenge, mainly because you should be at
around level nine. If not, level up until you're there. Red Panthers are a
little tougher than Goblins, so it might be a good idea to even level up more,
like to level ten or eleven. I beat this at level nine, and had no problems with
it, so you shouldn't either. All of the Red Panthers know Counter and Reveal, so
if you are using units with weak Weapon Defense, then attack from a distance.
You really don't need to have ultra-powerful attacks here. Just make sure you
bring along a white mage just in case you need it, and you'll do perfectly fine
on this mission.

Unlike the last two missions, you SHOULD NOT tackle this until you are at, at
the least, level twenty. You're up against seven Tonberries here, and you are
going to have to keep your distance in order to survive. Use a Summoner with
Doublecast; make sure she knows some damaging summons, Carbuncle, Pheonix, and
Unicorn. Cast Carbuncle on your units the moment the battle starts, and use
Unicorn whenever you are severely damaged. Phenoix should be used only when
units are KOed, but make sure you aren't going to revive any tonberries!

VS
Ezel: Hermetic lv. 29
Babus: Runeseeker lv. 31

One you defeat the Li-Grim, you should be at around level 30 or 31, maybe
higher. You should level up to at least level 33 or 34 before attempting this
mission. It's four against two here, so you will have an easier time. Ezel uses
Azoth, and that can put your whole party to sleep. Make sure you have a White
Mage that knows Esuna, just in case you are hit. Also, Ezel knows Block Arrows
and Weapon Atk+, while Babus knows Counter and Weapon Def+. I suggest having a
Paladin with Double Sword here; you probably have one already but if not, get
one! They can do major damage, which will seriously make the battle easier.

VS
Shara: Sniper lv. 33
Ritz: Elementalist lv. 37
Llednar: Biskmatar lv. 41

The suggested level here is 45. Yes, it is high, but trust me, this is one
difficult battle otherwise. All you really need to have is at least two powerful
characters at level 45, while the rest can be lower levels. A Paladin with
Double Sword is a MUST here and the stronger the weapons, the better. Remember
though, that Llednar is immune to Holy attacks, so you'll have to use someone
else to defeat him. Still, holy weapons are very strong, so bring them along so
you can use them against Ritz and Shara! Shara knows Auto-Regen, Llednar knows
Counter, and Ritz knows Absorb MP. Llednar also has the action ability called
Flair.

Babus: Runeseekr  lv. 31
Shara: Sniper lv. 33
Ritz: Elementalist lv. 37
Llednar: Biskmatar lv. 41

The recommended level stays the same as last time: level 45. Really, if you beat
the last mission, you should have no trouble with this one, although if the last
two gave you trouble, this might give you hell. Still, as long as you have
powerful people fighting, it's easy. The recommended jobs here are a Paladin
with Double Sword, a Summoner with Doublecast, an Assassin with Ultima Masher
and Last Breath, and an Alchemist with Death, Meteor, and Flare. That's one
strong party there, and it makes this battle really easy. All of the enemies
have the same reaction/support abilties, but Shara know has Red Magic, and Ritz
now has Corner, the Assassin job. That's cold, so you should take Ritz out
second, after Llednar. Good luck on this, you might need it.

+====--------------------------------------------------------------====+

Abilities play a major part in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. Without them,
you'll never get through the game. Each unit has specific abilities, and you
must master each ability before you can use it with any class. Later, I'll give
more information on abilities. For now, I'll list them!

NOTE: Due to the fact that I was rejected in sources (crap), this list will take
a LONG time to complete.

+====--------------------------------------------------------------====+
This guide will list all the rumors in the game. If you have some rumors I do
not have, e-mail me!

LAWS: A HISTORY
[How laws came to be]
Laws have been a part of life in Ivalice for hundreds of years. The king in
those days used powerful magic to create the first laws. The king then
established the judicial system to enforce his laws. Knowledge of the means to
control the law has been passed down the royal line ever since.

UNFAI LAWS!
[Laws are unfair]
Resentment towards Queen Remedi has been building these last few years. The
reson? Frequent and semmingly arbitrary changes in the laws. It's gone so far
that some pundits wryly say she's "...doing it to please that brat, the prince."

CRAZY MONSTERS
[The cause of crazy monsters]
Reports of crazy monsters have been increasing all over Ivalice. While the cause
is unknown, experts believe it has something to do with the crystals. The
crystals--pure magic in a solid form--are supposed to be somewhere in this
kingdom. Rumors say the place made the crystals--rumors the palace firmly
denies.

THE CRYSTALS
[What Are The Crystals?]
Bervenia Palace, silent on the matter up until now, has radically reversed its
policy concerning the crystals. According to information just released, crystals
exist in special folds in space, called "seams.' The report goes on to state
that "as the crystal's magic is beneficial to all Ivalice, special means are
being employed to protect them."

STRONG LAWS
[Laws get tougher]
By the order of Queen Remedit, laws are getting tougher once again. Protest
movements have already started in some clans. The reason given for this latest
strengthening of the law is "to maintain public order." This is likely a
reaction to the recent surge in clan warring.

SECRET SHOP
[Ezel's Secret Shop]
The famed Exel Berbier has apparently opened a secret shop in the town of
Cadoan. The new shop reportedly casters to law card traders.

THE JAGDS
[Jagds: The Bitter Truth]
The law is absolute in Ivalice, but there are some areas it cannot reach: the
jagds, lawwless slums where no judge will ever go. While this may sound
appealing to some, even hardened class-A criminals avoid the jagds, for without
judges and laws, there is nothing to prevent true death.

TRADE GOODS
[Trading Boom]
One-man trade merchants using small airships to do their business are on the
rise. Many of the merchants sell rare items, and the number of shops selling
traded goods is growing daily.

WANTED POSTER
[Wanted!]
Bervenia Palace has put a fat bounty on someone's head--but who? All the palace
can say is the fugitive is "a human member of some clan."

JUDGES ALONE
[Judges go independent]
Yesterday, Judgemaster Cid announced that the judicial system would hereafter
operate independently of the palace. This establishes the judicial system as a
truly neutral entity, free from palace politics. The decision was made with the
queen's approval.

ROYAL VACATION
[Queen On Vacation]
Her majesty Queen Remedi, along with Prince Mewt have decided to take a break
from the hectic administration of Ivalice and go on vacation. There has been no
announcement of where they are headed, nor any indication yet of when they will
return.

NEW ADVENTURE
[A New Adventure Awaits?]
The Pubkeepers Association recently announced the introduction of "expert"
missions, kept secret up until now. Clans across Ivalice have high expectations
for the new missions.


AUDIENCE DAY
[Audience Day]
The day of the yearly audience ceremony for Queen Remedi and Prince Mewt is fast
approaching. Also called "Gift Day," this day is an opportunity for people to
bring gifts to the royal mother and son. Will somebody find that special
something to satisfy them this year?

PRICES SOAR
[Materite Prices Soaring]
With Audience Day near, prices for materite, a prized manufacturing material,
are rising sharply. The price hike is thought to be due to a rise in demand as
craftsmen and mechinists work around the clock to make the ultimate gift for the
royal mother and son.

NEW CLOCK
[A New Clock From Belta]
Belta Co., renown for their exacting and professional work, has announced a new
product: the "Golden Sandclock." Belta timepieces are widely praised by judges
for their accuracy.

CLAN BORZOI
[Clan Borzoi]
I hear Clan Borzoi's on the war path these days, challenging other clans,
fighting for turf. Ach, things just aren't the way they used to be.

DIRTY SECRET[Borzoi's Dirty Secret]
Word on the street's that Clan Borzoi's got the blacking of a foreign criminal
ring! Maybe one with the eyes on Ivalice itself...

THIEF EXPOSED
[The thief they caught was identified as a member of Clan Borzoi. I dare say
they won't be sitting around quietly with one of their own in prison...

THE TOURNEYS
[Swords and Sorcery]
Swordsmen and sorcerers alike are competing in monthly tourneys across Ivalice.
There's even a few "tourney pros" who live off their winnings!

TOURNEY
[Bervenia Tourney's Back]
The Bernevia Tourney is scheduled to be held again this year in the palace
courtyard, and everyone's excited to see the best in the land compete!

SNOWY PASS
[Snow in Lutia!]
Snow was reported falling in large amounts in Lutia. While the parents worry
about the cause of this strange weather, the kids are out enjoying the snow.

CLAN LEAGUE
[Best Clan In The Land?]
The Clan League will be running again this year. While the favorites are last
year's winner, the Brown Rabbits, they'll have a lot of competition.
--About the Clan League--
The Clan League is a tiered competition to determine the best clan in the land.
Winners are chosen by popular vote and engagement standings. League Committee
Chair Cid expects a good tournout this year. The winners last year were the
Brown Rabbits, led by the Viera, Vili.

!ABILITIES
[! Abilities !]
If you want to win when you engage, master some abiliters! Yout weapons and
armor determine which abilities you can use, so choose carefully. You'll also
need some Ability Points (AP) to learn abilities; you can get those by equipping
armor and weapons, or by clearing missions. Everybody who goes on a mission has
a chance of getting AP, so be sure to take along your friends! That's all, good
luck to you!

!ABILITY TYPES
[! Ability Types !]
Action Abilities:
  Standard actions, like Black Magic or Monk Tech.
Reaction Abilities:
  Dodging or striking back when attacked.
Support abilities:
  Enhancement abilities such as Double Sword.
Combo Abilities:
 Abilities triggered when an ally uses a "combo."

JOB CHANGE
[! Job Change !]
Job changing can come in handy. Any soldier can cast spells by changing jobs to
mage. Choose the right job to maximize your engagement potential. One thing
though, your race determines what jobs you can be. Only vieras can become quick-
footed fencers, and bagnaas are tailor-made warriors... so make lots of friends!

EXPERT JOBS
[! Expert Jobs !]
The better you are at one job, the more job options that become available.
Expert jobs give access to powerful abilities, like Double Sword and Jump.

CONDITIONS
[! Win/Lose Conditions !]
Thought engaging was all about defeating your enemy? Think again--there are many
kinds of win condition depending on the engagement. You can check the win
condition during an engagement by selecting "Mission" from the main menu. But,
there's a lose condition as well, so be careful! If Marche leaves an engagement,
whether he's sent to prison or even zombified and then snuffed, you lose!

COMBOS
[! Combos !]
Ever notice the judge gives you a Judge Point (JP) when you defeat an enemy? You
can use those points to cooperate on "combo" attacks. Stock up those Judge
Points and do some real damage! Just make sure your allies have combo abilities
so they can pitch in!

EXEMPTION
[! Prison Exemption !]
You know there's people out there that never get a red card when they engage?
There's a special law that turns all their red cards yellow! You can tell one by
the ribbon they wear... the lucky bums.

THE TOTEMA
[! The Totema !]
The totema's appearance in Ivalice was sudden, and their origin unknown.
Unfathomable, too, is their incredible power. One thing we can say is, they seem
willing to lend that power to us. It is possible to summon the totema using
Judge Points (JP) obtained by defeating an enemy in an engagement. Only members
of the race that a tetema represents may summon that totema. In other words,
you'd get further talking to a rock than trying to summon another race's totema.

LAWS
[! Laws and Penalties !]
Laws, set by the palace, reign in Ivalice. Judges enforce those laws, and those
who break them are penalized--even sent to prison in the worst cases. There are
two kinds of cards you can get for braking a law. A minor infraction gets you a
yellow card. A major infraction will earn you a red card. Whichever penalty card
you get, it'll go down on you record--and the more cards on your record the
steeper your penalty becomes, so watch out!

LAW RANKINGS
[! Law Rankings !]
The judges use a ranking system to classify laws. The scriter the law, the
higher its rank. [R1] laws are reasy, but an [R5] law is nothing but trouble.

IMPRISONED
[! Imprisoned !]
One of your friends in jail? That means they can't fight, and that's bad. But,
if you got the gil, you can get them out and that's good! A "release" gets them
out of prison, but their penalty record stays. A "pardon" erases one person's
past record, but you have to go to prison in their place!

LAW CARDS
[! Law Cards !]
Thanks to Ezel, there's these cards out on the market now that can change the
laws. Select "Law Cards" after engaging to see what you have. If there's a
particular card you want, try trading with Ezel. White cards add new laws. Black
cards, or "antilaw cards" nullify laws, and the judges can't do a darn thing
about it!

NEGOTIATING
[! Engage or Negotiate? !]
Clan competition is fierce and engaging is the order of the day, but try
negotiating with the friendler clands to avoid needles engagements!

TREASURE HUNT
[! Treasure Hunt !]
Sometimes treasure apperas when you place a symbol on the world map. When you
see a symbol shaking, that's where the treasure is, so go get it.

REQUESTS
[! Mission Requests !]
You can advance your clan by accepting mimssion requests at the pub. You can use
the gil and items you earn on missions to equip your clan!

MISSION ITEMS
[! Mission Items !]
So you got yourself a mission item, eh? You can't equip those, but you can bring
them along on your missions. Mission items are good for boosting an ally's
capabilities--and some missions require certain items, so get as many as you
can.

CLAN LEVEL
[! Clan Level !]
Take a look at your clan level to see how well your clanwork's going. You also
have a skill level that goes up when you complete a mission. You need skill
levels to take on new missions. The higher you skill and clan levels go, the
better your clan title gets, and that means more items and cheaper prices!

SKILL LEVLES
[! Skill Levels !]
There are eight kinds of skill levels:
Combat     Magic
Smithing   Craft
Appraise   Gather
Negotiate  Track

CLAN TURF
[! Clans And Their Turf !]
The area of a clan's infulence is called its "turf"--and some clans think that
means they can exploit whoever lives on land under their control. If you look at
the map, you'll see that only your turf is colored in. Take care if you're going
to try to liberate any areas under the control of another clan--if you see a
free area go red, it means that another clan's trying to take it! If you don't
engage them quick and drive them off, it's all theirs.

LINKING
[! Link !]
Attatch a Game Boy Advance Game Link cable to link with others. You can fight
together, trade items, and even trade clan members!

TRADE GOODS
[! Trade Items !]
You can buy trade items just like regular items, and some are great deals! The
more you link, the more items Nono can offer, so link often, kupo--!

NOTE: The majority of this section is due to the Offical Nintendo Player's Guide

This section will first list the enemies, and then there will be a sub-section
that lists all enemy-exclusive abilities.

The way I'll present an enemy is first I'll state the name, then it's A-ability,
R-ablity, S-Ablity, and what it absorbs and is weak against.

The enemies are listed alphabetically by job, and then alphabetically by name.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A bomb's power really depends on how good your character's defense is. By that I
mean if you have low defense and are damaged easily, these guys can be a real
threat to you. Their Blowup attack causes a self-suicide, but it deals MAJOR
damage to whoever is near them. Even if you have a high defense rating, it can
deal some pretty good damage to a character. Their other attacks, which are
Flame Attack and Chill, are pretty much no threat because they simply don't have
that much power. Bring in a Black Mage whenever you see these guys, because Fire
and Ice Color Magic almost always deals a one-hit KO. On a final note, the Bombs
and Grenades won't use Blowup unless they are critical (kneeling) so you're safe
if you just take them out before their HP gets too low.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Bugs can be a real threat if they have about the same status as you, but
that is mainly due to the fact that they know Lv3 Def-less and Lv 5 Death. If
you are facing a Jawbreaker and one of your units has a level that is a multiple
of 5 (if you don't know math, then you're doomed), it's an INSTANT K.O. so make
sure you take out a Jawbreaker first if you meet with one. Their Lev 3 Def-less
move can seriously lower your Magic Resistance and Weapon Defense, so you'll
have to be careful about that. Don't be fooled by their color; although the
Antlion is blue, it isn't weak against fire and although the Jawbreaker is red,
Ice won't do any additional damage to it. Their other attacks which are
Sandstorm and Suffocate can hurt your units, but it isn't anything major to
worry about.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dragons are probably the most powerful, if not THE most powerful, regular enemy
in the game. Their breaths can be devastating, and if you add the fact that they
know Weapon Attack+ and Weapon Defense+, they can be a pain to take down. Their
regular "Fight" attack can cause major damage to a character that is about their
level, and it can usually end up giving a weak character an instant KO. I guess
the Dragons realize this also, because they'll usually lower your defense with
Guard-Off and raise their attack with Dragon Force. If those two moves have been
successfully used, you're their meat lunch. They have very high attack and
defense ratings, and if an Icedrake uses Mighty Guard and a Thundrake uses
Dragon Force, their defense and attack will be raised by a large amount, making
them very hard to defeat.

Although their names suggest that they have weaknesses, they don't so don't
bring out a character with Color Magic that includes things like Blizzaga and
Fiagra just because you think it'll defeat them a lot faster.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fairies have very low HP, and somewhat low attack and defense, but their attacks
can drive you mad. First, about the HP. I'd say that the Sprite is probably one
of the weakest regular enemies in the game, due to the fact that even a level
30ish Sprite can have only around 110 HP, and decent Weapon Attack and Defense.
The Titania is a little better than the Sprite, but not by much. The Sprite's
Whtie Wind can be good and bad. It heals a unit so their HP equals the HP of the
Sprite using it. So it can heal only a few points of damage, or it can heal
maybe over a third to two thirds of damage. The Titania's Angel Whisper is a
pain; it will heal HP and bestow Auto-Raise. Auto-Raise will instantly revive a
character if they are KOed, so don't sit back when you KO everyone.

Lv?DHoly causes damage to characters whose level matches the day of the month,
so when you're just starting out your game and are below level 21, make sure
none of your character's levels match the day of the month. Meteorite causes
minor damage to a character, and isn't that much of a deal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you just stick to simply physical attackers like Soldiers, Ninjas, and
Thieves (or basically any job that doesn't know a magical attack) Flans can be
the biggest pain you'll even meet. Their defense is insanely high. Even if
you're at level 40 and they're at level 15, a regular "Fight" attack could only
end up doing an amazing one or two points of damage to them. Even a totema won't
damage them at all (it defenitely won't damage higher than five). If you rely on
people with jobs such as Mages, these guys are the weakest things ever. They
have VERY low magic defense, so low that even a simple magic attack that they
aren't weak against can instantly KO them. That's about the only way you can
damage these guys.

Their attacks are moderate. Acid and their color magic attacks don't deal much
damage unless you are using a really weak character. Sacrifice won't affect your
party, but it'll heal all status ailments and HP to another characer while
performing a self-KO. It can be irritating, but hey that's one less flan you
need to deal with.

The Floateyes are one of those enemies in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance that
aren't too much of a pain, but aren't too little of a pain either. They are
somewhere in the middle. Roulette will instantly KO a random character, but it
can be either a friend or foe so it is can be good or bad. Unfortunately, if
you're doing some big important mission where you're required to defeat a
powerful main character, Roulette will miss. On anyone else, it doesn't. Even
though Roulette can help you, I'd take the Ahrimans out first if they end up in
a battle with you. They can be difficult to get to, since they often run to
corners of the arena and constantly use roulette.

The other three attacks that Floateyes know aren't that bad. Circle can lower
some of your status, but not by much. Devil Gaze causes silence and darkness,
although that isn't terribly bad. Stare will confuse multiple units, and that is
probably the second-worst attack besides Roulette.

Meet the job class of the goblins. They are incredibly weak enemeies that have
very few attacks, and the attacks that they have aren't that powerful at all.
You'll see them in the first mission, and then they'll pretty much disappear. I
myself haven't come across one since Herb Picking. Anyway, Goblin Punch will
simply do a small amount of damage to your units. Magic Hammer causes MP damage,
and that can somewhat hurt you if you rely on a character that uses magic to
deal damage. You'll almost never see the Redcaps use Mutilate, which will absorb
HP. It's a small amoutn and is nothing to worry about. Overall, these guys can
easily be taken out in one hit if you are at the right level.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Lamias rank in the "slightly dangerous" category. Hand Slap can deal major
damage to your character if they are weak, but other than that it isn't that
strong. Poison Frog is the REALLY annoying attack. First, it poisons you and
second, it turns you into a frog. You know what happens when you're turned into
a frog? Your defense drops like an anchor and your attack reduces to a whopping
1 point of damage. Ouch, painful. The Liliths are the bigger danger here, due to
the fact that they have Poison Frog AND Twister, which is an attack that halves
a unit's HP. It can never kill you, but it can get you down to critical in a
short amount of time. If you ever encounter a Lilith in a battle, eliminate it
as soon as possible.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Malboros are basically good in only one category: Status ailments. The only
attack they have that doesn't affect your status is Goo,k which immoblizes your
character. Bad Breath is probably one of the BIGGEST. PAINS. EVAR. It causes
around five status ailments AT ONCE to you unit. Make sure you bring lots of
healing items before a battle with a Malboro. Don't try to counter Bad Breath
with your own staus ailment attacks; the Big Malboro knows Soundwave, and that
attack nullifies all stat ailments. Use powerful magic on these guys when you
encounter them in battle, and be prepared to suffer through some status effects.

The Panther job class is, like most others, a "not too dangerous and not too
weak" kind of enemy. Their Blaster move can be very annoying, since it can
petrify units and that makes them as good as a KOed character. Poison Claw
causes minor damage while poisoning, but it isn't that big of a deal if you have
an antidote with you. Rend will deal some decent damage to your character, while
will increase the panther's speed. Overall, just use powerful attacks to defeat
these guys and you'll be fine.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Rockbeast job class is somewhat rare, but they are very, very strong. In
defense I mean. Really, even the strongest characters will only end up doing
around fifty to sixty damage to these guys, and they have around 350 HP. The
move Limit Glove is very, very annoying. When the Blade Biter is critical, it'll
probably use Limit Glove. It deals a TON of damage to your units. Munch can also
be very annoying, and if the Blade Biter uses it on all of your units, you are
pretty much SCREWED! Why? Munch will crush your equipped weapon and will deal HP
damage. Without a weapon, your attack drops like a rock so you'll only be doin
around tne damage to the Rockbeasts. Resonate disables units, which can be
really irritating.

If you don't have anything to cure disable, move away from the battle until you
are able to act again. Matra Magic will switch your HP and MP amount for the
battle, which can be good or bad depending on the unit's HP and MP count.

The tonberries are easily one of the most dangerous enemies in this game, or in
any Final Fantasy game. Why? One word: Knife. The name doesn't sound bad, but
what Knife does is reduce your HP by ___9/10!___ That, of course, will instantly
put your character to critical status and unless you don't do something fast to
heal yourself, you're dead by the next turn. Just your luck, both berries know
it. Voodoo is a curse attack that'll doom your character, and karma is very
dangerous. Its attack will slowly rise as the Tonberry KOs more and more units.
If you ever run into a berry, take them out of the fight or at least disable
them beacause Knife is basically what makes them dangerous.

What, you didn't think the undead would be in this game? Anyway, the Undead
class comes close to being one of the most dangerous classes. No, let me
rephrase that. The VAPMIRE comes close to being one of the most dangerous
ENEMIES. The Zombie is pretty much nothing, except for the fact that it knows
Miasma which poisons and damages your character. Lv?S-Flare is like all the
other LV attacks because it causes major damage. This specific LV attack causes
damage to all units that are the same level as the attacker. So if you have a
powerful character that's the same level as the vampire, either don't bring it
in or level up FAST! One positive thing about the undead (in your favor) is that
they are weak against holy.

This means that any holy attack will cause SERIOUS damage to your enemies.
Another thing is that a potion, hi-potion, x-potion, or pheonix down will do
some huge damage to the zombies. Also, any attack that cures units will do
damage to zombies. So your white mages can actually do some nice damage for
once! Yay! :) Anyway, one bad thing about the undead is the fact that when they
are KOed, they are instantly revived three turns later. Not with full health,
but enough for them to go on a little while longer. So if you take out an
undead, finish the rest of the enemies off FAST!

While going through that, you might have noticed that some things like clan
skills and clan levels sounded strange to you. Well, let me explain. Whenever
you fight a battle or complete a mission, you'll gain clan points. You clan
points are saved until you hit 100. Then your clan level will rise by one and
the clan point counter will reset back to zero. There are small "sub-level" clan
levels also. There are eight levels: Comat, Smithing, Appraise, Negotiate,
Magic, Craft, Gather, and Track. COMBAT looks like a little sword. SMITHING
looks like an ax with a block attactched to it. APPRAISE looks a little like a
magnifying glass. NEGOTIATE is two hands shaking. MAGIC is a lightning bolt.
CRAFT looks like some plyers. GATHER is a little net and TRACK is two feet.

By getting smaller amounts of clan points (not 100) you can raise those eight
sub-levels. Raising the sub-levels improves your clan title, and it also gives
you certain items whenever a skill hits a certain level. These are the items
gained, listed in alphabetical order.

THE CLAN MENU

This part will list the clan menu and what each option is and does.

-=-=-=-=-=-=
MISSION LIST
=-=-=-=-=-=-

Here, you can check out the status of missions of have contracted. If you
selecet the mission, you can view the report, how many days you have left, who
you sent out, etc. This option will appear in black if no missions are currently
contracted.

-=-=-=
REPORT
=-=-=-

This is a nice option. Here, you can view the report of all the missions you
have completed. This report looks nice when you have a ton of missions
completed. Anyway, if a mission is highlighted, then it has been completed. If a
mission is in black, it has not been completed. If you select a highlighted
mission, you can view the report, or description, of the mission.

=-=-=-=-=
CLAN TURF
-=-=-=-=-

At the clan turf menu, you can see what turf you clan currently has. The more
turf your clan has, the more money you can save at the shops (although money
isn't really a problem in this game). To get turf, you must complete a free-area
mission, which is a dispatch mission marked with a little flag. All of your clan
turf appears colored in. Gray turf is turf that has not yet been conqured, and
red turf is turf that you have, but is under attack. If you own turf, sometimes
it'll suddenly shake while you're walking on the world map. If that happens, you
have a set number of days (usually forty days) to get to the area and fight a
battle to gain your turf back.

MISSION ITEMS
-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Here, you can view the mission items you have, its status, and you can select
whether or not you want to discard the item. Discarding mission items can
sometimes be tough to do, mainly because some mission items you gain can never
be gained again and you'll have to trade with another clan to get them back.
(I'll put in a list of mission items that are safe to throw away eventually.)
You can carry up to 64 mission items, which seems like a lot, but once you hit
the limit, you're staying up there for a while. Some missions require you to
have certain mission items, while other missions can reward you with additional
bonuses other than the ones that you'd get regularly if you take a certain
mission item with you.

If you press select, you can view how a mission item can raise your clan's
status if you bring it along.

LAW CARDS
-=-=-=-=-

Here, you can view how many law cards you have, and what law cards you have. You
can carry up to twenty law cards. Law cards are marked in pink, and antilaw
cards are marked brown with a yellow X. See the next chapter for more info on
laws and law cards.

SUPPORT CLANS
=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Here, you can view support clans, which are clans that you link up with. So if
you link up with a friend, your friend's clan will be regarded as a support
clan. You can view your support clan's status in this option.

|                      (13) LAWS AND LAW CARDS                         |
+====--------------------------------------------------------------====+

This part will list all the laws in the game, and what they do, as well as the
recommended abilities. It also describes law cards, how to use them, and some
special law cards.

Laws are very important in Ivalice. There are many laws, and they change every
day. To look at the current laws on the world map press [L]. To look at the
current laws before a battle (on the select character screen) press [Select]. To
view a law DURING a battle, press B and move the yellow sqaure to an empty spot.
Then presst [Start] and select Laws.

The judge is there to give out punishments for laws. Breaking a law once simply
by doing an attack and succesfully completing it without KOing anyone will get
you a YELLOW CARD. Yellow cards are minor and after the battle, you get a
punishment for getting the card. These punishments involve losing all equipped
equipment, status permanetely down, gil fines, item fines, and law card fines.

If you KO someone by doing something against the law or if you get two yellow
cards, you'll instantly get a RED CARD. Red cards are the worst punishment you
can get. Your unit is instantly sent to jail and cannot participate in the rest
of the battle. It also uneqips all equipment when sent to jail, and loses all
judge points that have been saved up. At the end of the battle, an additional
punishment will be granted that includes losing all equipped equipment, status
permanetely down, gil fines, item fines, and law card fines. After the battle,
you can go to a prison and release the unit. Releasing a unit costs gil, and the
cost can get extremely high sometimes.

Once you get a yellow or red card it goes down on your record. You can view your
record in the status screen. It shows how many red and yellow cards you've
gotten. Your record plays an important role in the game, since the punishments
get more severe as your record gets worse. For example, if your record is 0
yellow cards and 0 red cards, and you get a yellow card, you'll get only a minor
punishment, like losing an item. The yellow card will remain on your record. If
you have 0 yellow cards and 0 red cards, and you get a red card, you'll get a
slightly worse punishment, like a card or gil fine, but it won't be terrible. If
you have a terrible record (say for exapmple you have 3 yellow cards and 2 red
cards) and you get a yellow or red card, the punishments can be a killer. It is
usually status down FOR GOOD.

Even worse than that, you can end up losing all equipment that is currently on
you. If your record is VERY BAD (say you have around 9 yellow cards and 9 red
cards) you can get a major status down. I once got defense down by 86 points. So
of course, you need to reset if you want any hope of succeeding with that unit.
Your record also applies to the amount of gil that is required for a release. So
if you have 6 red cards and 8 yellow cards, you'll get a mad fine, but something
like 0 yellow cards and 1 red card will cost around 1,000 to 2,000 gil.

You can clear your record though. If you go to the prison and select pardon, you
can pay gil (again, depends on the unit's record) to lock them up for a certain
amount of time. This certain amount of time applies to battles. So if you have,
lets say one yellow card and three red cards, a unit can be suspended for three
battles. Once you fight three battles, you can go to the prison and pick up your
unit. When you check their record, it'll be clear. I know this doesn't seem
worth it but trust me, it is.

There is one more thing that I need to tell you before I list the laws. It is
about jagds. There are three jagds in the game, and each one is marked by a
skull. Jagds are places the judges cannot reach, so there are no laws there.
This is good in one way and VERY bad in another. It is good because there is
nothing holding you back and you can do anything you want without having to use
law cards up. It is bad due to the fact that if your units are KOed there, and
are still KOed by the end of the battle, they are gone FOR GOOD! This includes
everyone but Marche (so that means Montblanc). So if you don't want to lose your
units, make sure you revive them before the battle ends!

Now the laws. I'll tell you all the laws that are found in the land of Ivalice.
You start the game out with having only one law a day, but after you complete
the fifth mission, it'll raise to two laws a day. Later in the game (forgot
when), the laws will increase to three laws a day.


This is how I'll lay out a law (they'll be listed in alphabetical order):

Now for law cards. Law cards may not seem that important early in the game (like
when there's only two laws), but once you get to having three laws a day, it is
usually going to end up with at least one of the laws being against you. So of
course, you can use a law card to nullify that law FOR THE BATTLE. There are two
types of law cards: Add-law and antilaw.

Add-law cards are shown in pink, and they add laws to a battle. This can work in
you favor though. Say for exapmle, the enemy has a very damaging target all
attack. If you use the law card that makes target all illegal, they can no
longer use it. Of course, this means that you can't use one either, so be
careful!

Antilaws are shown in black. Anitlaws are good, because they nullfiy laws. Say
that healing is forbidden and you need to revive a character. If you have the
healing anitlaw card, you can use it and healing will be legal! Thi also means,
however, that the enemy can do stuff that they couldn't do before, so watch out!

Well now the question is, "How do I use my law cards?" Well it is quite simple.
First, during a battle, bring the laws up (remember, it must be DURING the
battle; if you don't remember how to bring the laws up, refer to the top of the
chapter). Then press the (A) button to bring your law cards up. You can now
select what add-law and antilaw cards you want to use!

Now how do you get law cards, you ask? Well you get them by two things: rewards
and trades. You get them from rewards by winning battles. You usually get a max
of two cards, but on rare occasions, you'll only get one. Now for trading. In
some towns (Candodan I think), there is an option called "Card Shop". Go here to
visit Ezel's secret card shop, which contains all the different law cards. He
doesn't have all the cards each time, but visit often and he'll get new cards.

Trading cards isn't that simple. Each card has a rank, and that rank shows how
much it is worth. Then ther is a cost (the highest is 24). To trade cards, you
must meet that cost. So say for example, you want to recieve an R6 Antilaw card
(more on those later). The cost of that is 24. So if you just choose to trade an
Ice card, whose rank is only one, you'll need to select more cards to trade
until you meet the required cost. The better the card is, the more it's worth
and the more it costs. Weak cards, like adding and nullifying ice, only cost a
rank of 6, and they are worth only one.

I will list the cards, their cost, and how much they're worth later. For now,
I'll tell you about some certain cards taht'll help you a lot throughout the
game.

R1 ANTILAW
WORTH: 6
COST: 24
This is the first of the six Rank antilaws. This is also powerful, but not as
powerful as the allmighty. An R1 Antilaw nullfies all Rank 1 laws in effect. So
it can end up nullifying only one, but then again it can end up nullifying all
three!

R2 ANTILAW
WORTH: 6
COST: 24
The second of the six Rank antilaws. Since R2 laws become more common later in
the game, you'll need this card a lot. It'll nullify all Rank 2 law cards that
are currently in effect.

R3 ANTILAW
WORTH: 6
COST: 24
As you guessed, the third of the six Rank antilaws nullifies all Rank 2 laws
that are currently in effect. Save it for the halfway point through the main
storyline, because more Rank 3 laws will appear then.

R4 ANTILAW
WORTH: 6
COST: 24
The fourth of the six Rank antilaws will nullify all Rank 4 laws in effect. Near
the end of the game, R4 antilaws will start appearing like crazy, and it is
important to have this card then.

R5 ANTILAW
WORTH: 6
COST: 24
The fifth of the six Rank antilaws will nullify all of the Rank 5 laws that are
currently in effect. At the end of the game, you'll see almost nothing but this
in all three slots, so make sure you have many saved up.

R6 ANTILAW
WORTH: 6
COST: 24
The final of the six Rank antilaw cards will nullify all Rank 6 laws currently
in effect. By the end of the game, and after the game, you'll see almost NOTHING
but Rank 6 antilaws (a few Rank 5 antilaws, but almost nothing else), so this
card can be as powerful as the Allmighty card! Speaking of Allmighty...


ALLMIGHTY
WORTH: 7
COST: ???
This is the best card you can get, and so far I have not found any in the card
shop. The Allmighty card nullfies ALL laws in effect. It doesn't matter what,
they'll just be nullified. I have found only two of these powerful cards, and
that has been through specific missions that are from Ezel only. Use this card
wisely, like when everything is against you. Otherwise, you might not have it
when you _really_ need it!

|                        (14) THE MONSTER BANK                         |
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since I have been receiving many e-mails lately about the Monster Bank, I've
decided to make a chapter going in-depth on how the monster bank works.

The Monster Bank is, for people who don't know, a place where captured monsters
go when they are... captured. The Monster Bank is located in Cyril, and it can
hold up to 20 monsters at one time. Beware of the dreaded law penalty that
releases a random monster from the bank!

Well, the first question you might have is, "How do I capture a monster?"
Capturing monsters is not as obvious as you may think. To capture a monster, you
must first get a Hunter. The Hunter job can be obtained by mastering two ARCHER
abilities. Once you master the abilities, the Hunter job will become available
for humans only. Using the Ranger Bow, you can learn the ability "Capture" for
200 AP. If you use capture on a monster and it is successful, they'll glow
black, then disappear.

You need to know that capturing a monster is not that easy. You can't just use
Capture the moment the battle starts. If you do, there is a 99.999% chance that
you'll miss. You first must weaken the monster until it is at critical status.
Then you should weaken it even more, until its HP is lower than 15 or so. If you
use Subdue, which is a move only Paladins can learn by using the Ancient Sword,
it'll make things easier. Subdue causes light damage and its main purpose is to
help you capture monsters. Once a monster is very, very weak, THEN you're ready
to capture it. Keep in mind that there is still around a 50-60% chance that
you'll still miss even when the monster is really weak. You should get behind
the monster to increase your chances of succeeding in capturing.

Also, if you have the move Concentrate, which is a support ability that
increases your hit rate, it'll make things even easier. When you capture a
monster, it'll disappear from the battle, and you'll get a "soul".

###############
WHAT IS A SOUL?
###############

Souls are "items" that you get when you capture a monster. A Soul is an item
that only a Morpher can use. The only race that can learn the job Morpher is the
Nu Mou race, and Souls are the Morpher's source of power. If a Morpher equips a
Soul, he or she can learn the abilities of the monster that contained the soul
that the Nu Mou has. For example, if you capture a Dragon, you'll get a Dragon
Soul. If you give a Dragon Soul to a Morpher, the Morpher can learn all the
moves a Dragon has! There are nine different Souls in the game, and each one is
exclusive to a certain monster. If a Morpher learns all the moves from every
soul, they can be very powerful. Training a Morpher requires patience though, so
clear you schedule if you plan to make the ultamite Morpher. On a final note,
the job Morpher only becomes available after you capture five monsters.

###################################
I'VE CAPTURED A MONSTER. WHAT NEXT?
###################################

Well, you can head to the monster bank to "play" with your monster. This may not
seem that important, but trust me, it is. Depending on how much you raise your
monster, your Morpher will grow more powerful. How do you play with your
monster? Well, you basically have to give it items. When you first capture a
monster, it'll hate you. As you give it more items, its respect for Marche will
grow. This is what monsters say and whether it means they like Marche or not.

Grrurr... (What are you looking at?)
You have just captured the monster and it greatly loathes you.

(Gimmie food.)
You've given the monster a couple of items that it likes, and it thinks you're
okay.

(Thanks for dropping by.)
You've given the monster a bunch of items that it enjoys, and it has high
respect for you.

(I love you Marche. No, really, I love you!)
You've spoiled the monster to death and now it has VERY high respect for Marche.
This is the best response you can get.
----------

Not all monsters like certain items. For exapmple, if you give a monster too
much of one item, it'll start to get sick of it. This won't raise the monster's
respect toward Marche at all. You'll have to experiment with different items to
find out what each monster likes. These are the messages you'll get when you
give a monster an item.

-------------------------
Ick, it spit it back out.
-------------------------
The monster hates this item. You've either given wayyy to much of a certain item
to a monster or it just downright doesn't like it. This isn't going to make the
monster any happier.

---------------------------
It seems to be enjoying it!
---------------------------
The monster finds the item to be pretty good. This will raise its respect toward
Marche a little bit. This is usually the reaction you'll get when you first feed
a monster an item.

----------------------------------
It seems to like that quite a lot!
----------------------------------
The monster likes that item a lot. This raises its respect towards Marche a
bunch.
><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>

Okay, not all monsters can be captured. There are some races of monsters that
just CAN'T be captured and some specific monsters that can't be captured. The
"specific" monsters are hard to identify, but these are the races that you can
capture monsters from.

------------------------------------
MONSTER NAME     | SOUL RECEIVED   |
------------------------------------
Antlion          | Bug Soul        |
------------------------------------
Bomb             | Bomb Soul       |
------------------------------------
Dragon           | Dragon Soul     |
------------------------------------
Flan             | Flan Soul       |

Floateye         | Eye Soul        |
------------------------------------
Lamia            | Lamia Soul      |
------------------------------------
Malboro          | Malboro Soul    |
------------------------------------
Panther          | Panther Soul    |
------------------------------------

Remember that these are the RACES of monsters. You can capture all monsters
within that specific race.

|                             (15) FAQ                                 |
+====--------------------------------------------------------------====+

Alert the weasels! A FAQ! Yeah! All those Final Fantasy Tatics Advance info you
wanted to know, but were afraid to ask!

Q: What does the WT at the bottom stand for?
A: How many turns your character has to wait.

Q: Can I help with this FAQ?
A: No. I currently need no help.

Q: How do I do [insert mission here]?
A: If it isn't in the FAQ, I haven't gotten to it. I type a strategy right after
I complete a mission, so wait a couple days and I'll reach it.

Q: How many missions are there?
A: 300

Q: Can you list all the jobs?
A: All jobs can be found in chapter two.

Q: I need extra help on [insert mission here]!
A: If my strategy isn't working for you, I'll send you an alternate strategy

Q: Yur faq is kewl, lol!!!!!!!!!!!!111
A: Please, anyone, don't ever send me an e-mail like this.

Q: How do I use antilaw cards?
A: Check the FAQ before asking these types of questions.

Q: How do I get more missions? The same ones keep appearing!
A: Yeah this can happen once you've completed a lot of missions. You just need
to walk around, fight a few battles, and walk around some more a missions will
start to appear again.

Q: I heard you can get Ezel, Ritz, Shara, Cid, and Babus! Is this true?
A: Yes it is.

Q: How do I get a morpher?
A: You must capture five monsters first.

Q: How much does ultima damage cost?
A: Well, the MP cost is usually 60, but the AP cost is 999!

Q: Should I get this or Final Fantasy Tactics?
A: I personally think that Final Fantasy Tactics has some more positive things
than this game, but this game has excellent replay value and a very deep game
length.

Q: How many units can I have in my clan?
A: 24

Q: How come my ablities keep disappearing! I equip learn one, but later it
vanishes!
A: This is because you haven't mastered an ability. Once you equip and item, you
must keep that item and job until you gain the required AP for that ability.
Then you can use it even after you unequip the item. If that's not the cause,
then you got the AP down penalty for breaking a law.

Q: I used a totema, but then the option disappeared! Help!
A: You must have 10 judge points saved up to use a totema.

Those are all I've recieved so far.

|                          (16) SECRETS                                |
+====--------------------------------------------------------------====+

   When you enter a clan battle kill all the enemies but one,use your archers
arm
and leg aim. The move all you characters except your archer to a corner then If
they are soldiers and have the aid skill they may use this and you other party
members may use potions or cure magic etc.Your archer may also you these skills
or
their own skills just anytime an enemies leg disablement wears off just use it
again and I think you will see that it is an excellent way to gain levels!

Basically, you get more experience points if you carry out an action on a
character
of a higher level - the higher the better, as you get 2 exp points for every
level
higher than you.  So you get 20 points if you're a level 20 character who hits a
level 25 one.  ...But that also applies to the nice things, like potions, or
white
magic.  So to level up quickly, always take along a higher level character and
use
your potions on them for extra EXP!  This is no good, of course, if you have a
hard-core of 6 characters you always use, but if you have an extended party and
some get left behind, then use an easy level to do this on.  Even better, do it
on
a level with animals, as you can have one character keep a rockbeast or
something
under control while your others collect experience for a while.

I'll be working to death trying to complete all other chapters so I can simply
focus on the missions.

10/20/03 If you saw the last update, you might have noticed a chapter in the
Table Of Contents that was no where to be found in the guide. It's up and
complete now, as well as me adding some more ablities to the list. Also added
more mission requirements.

10/26/03 Well, it seems that missions have started appearing again, so I'll be
writing those guides in now. Also finished the clans chapter. Yay.

11/02/03 Added a few more missions and abilities in here. I'm not gonna add
anymore dispatch missions until all of the other missions are complete, so if
you're waiting for those, you'll just have to be a bit patient.

11/02/03 (LATER) Heh, I stopped my monster guide halfway through a sentence in
the last update. Woops. Anyway, that section is complete and added a lot more
abilities. I'm still working a ton on all the additional chapters, and some new
ones are going to be added soon (like within a week or so)!

11/07/03 Added a new chapter and got almost halfway through it. Also added some
more stuff to the other additional chapters.

11/09/03 Added more stuff to the abilities and mission items. And got five more
missions in the sub-mission chapter. Yay.

11/10/03 More missions added and got a new chapter in: Clan critiques. If you
send me your clans, I can critique them and tell you what's good and bad, and
how to improve them.

11/11/03 I only have two more battle missions and one more encounter mission!
I'll probably post all of the dispatch missions in one update. This FAQ should
be complete by the end of the week! Yay!

11/12/03 Well, I was wrong. I didn't tackle all of the dispatch missions in one
update. I'd say by Friday this FAQ will be complete. I added TONS of dispatch
missions, though.

11/13/03 Okay, got two KB worth of dispatch missions in. Yay. Tomorrow, I'll get
in at least 110 more missions, if not getting all of them in.

11/14/03 I did it! I actually completed this FAQ! Yay! All that's left now are a
few multiplayer-only missions, and some reserve missions. Also, missions items
and abilities, but that's it. I'm going to try to do all of that tomorrow.

11/15/03 Started the layout reconstruction. It's completed status is at about
65%. Everything will get done tomorrow.

11/16/03 Finished abilities, almost all of the missions are in. I added a lot
more corrupt judge missions and the layout reconstruction is at about 70%
completion. By the end of the week, you should see all rumors, abilities, and
they layout in.

11/17/03 Whoa! This is the thirty-ninth update! This is one big project! Anyway,
all abilities are done, and I finished all link missions. All that's left are a
few corrupt judge missions and abilities, which will be done Friday. After that,
there won't be as many constant updates (I usually update them every day, or
every two days but now, maybe once a week or every two weeks), and by the end of
the month, you'll probably be seeing the final version. I am waiting until
Friday to finish because I want to get all my other stuff done. I also need to
start working on my next project, and I don't want to have to work on this at
the same time.

11/18/03 Okay, all abilities done.

11/22/03 EVERYTHING done. Every little thing in the damn game is complete. All
of the leftover rumors are in and the final corrupt judge missions are in. That
means that this is a TOTALLY comlpete FAQ! I'm not marking it as "Final" yet,
because I still love this game and I might want to go back and update it. But I
have started on another project already, so don't expect many more updates.

11/25/03 I thought I'd never do this but... I added yet another new chapter.
Secrets. I can't believe I forgot about that. Expect to see TONS of information
on
secret characters later, since I haven't included that yet.

01/04/04 Added ASCII art

01/02/05 The final update I am making to this FAQ.

+====--------------------------------------------------------------====+

My e-mail address is cskull@frogdesign.com. There are a few things that
you can e-mail me about, and few things that you can't. First the
things that are okay.

Information on the game. No this does NOT mean five long page mission
strategies or something I haven't covered because if it isn't there, it will
be soon.
It means additional TIPS on beating a  mission or correcting information that
I messed up. Secrets are _TOTALLY_ accepted.

Asking permission to use this FAQ. You can see full details on this in
the final chapter.

Suggestions for the FAQ. Something like, "Why don't you add such and
such in your FAQ. NOT "Why don't you totally re-do your FAQ because it
sucks!" That is just plain rude and annoying. If you don't like my
FAQ, tell me things to make it better!

The things that you CAN'T e-mail me about are...

Spam. This is the NUMBER 0NE thing that you must not send. I get at
least twenty spam e-mails a day and I don't need yours it doesn't
help. Please don't send any.

Praise/Hate mail. Yes I appreciate it if you praise my FAQ. No I don't
appreciate it if you send me an e-mail saying, "Your FAQ is the
biggest piece of **** ever created! It sucks!" Those two things just
fill up my inbox and it really annoys me.

Spelling/Grammar mistakes. I used to get about ten e-mails a day
saying, "You spelled these two words wrong." or something like, "You
used inappropriate grammar in this chapter." Please people! I can find
those on my own!

And that wraps up the contact. Once again my e-mail is: cskull@frogdesign.com

http://db.gamefaqs.com/portable/gbadvance/file/final_fantasy_tactics_advance_b.t

No other credits so far. Now the legal...

Some of you people have no idea how annoying it is to see your FAQ on
someone else's site. DON'T put this on your site or in your book or
magazine. Don't take any PARTS of this guide without my permission. I
will find out somehow by someone who e-mails me and I will get very
mad at them. You can, however, print this guide out for your own use.

The big sin: DON'T GIVE YOURSELF CREDIT FOR THIS FAQ!
Ever, ever, ever! Plagiarism is the number one thing that pisses me
off. If I find this FAQ on someone's site without my permission AND
without my name on it, I'm not even going to send a nice little e-mail
telling you to remove it. I'll get serious FAST! Using this guide as
your own is against the law, and can result in severe punishments.
Altering this section is also against U.S. law and can result in
severe punishments.
