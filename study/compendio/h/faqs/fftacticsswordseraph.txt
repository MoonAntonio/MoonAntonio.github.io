-1.1 About-


Ah yes, Final Fantasy Tactics.  It's possibly the jewel in Squaresoft's
crown of games.  It's the jewel that fell between the cracks and has
recently been recovered and re-mounted.

Now, I've looked through most of these guides, and to my horror,
none of them goes truly in-depth on getting all of the hidden
special characters!

They touch on it, of course, but none does _THAT_ great a job.

So here I am, and I present to you a complete, tested FAQ of how to
get all of the hidden special characters.  I've gotten some new
information from board members as to the authenticity of this and
I even learned some new things.

I'm basically making this guide for 2 reasons:

1) No other guide goes as in-depth on getting the hidden characters.

And

2) Maybe, just MAYBE it will quell the number of "How do I get _____?"
topics on the FFT message board.  I do my best to keep a topic about
it on the board, but, it does get purged every once in awhile.
This is just a (hopefully) permanent source for this information.

I've also decided to include the abilities these characters can use,
and their damage formulas (thanks to AeroStar for letting me use this
information.)

Of course, there are _MASSIVE SPOILERS_ in this guide.  If you want to
figure this stuff out for yourself, TURN BACK NOW.


-1.2 Updates-


Sunday, March 17, 2002: Made minor changes addressing slight errors in
content.

Monday, November 4, 2002: Made several setups to be posted soon, updated
e-mail addy.

Friday, January 3, 2002: More setups, finally had some time to do this.
Will send update today or tomorrow. Setup section is FAR from complete,
but I've at least started. =)



                     _______________________________________
____________________/2. The Hidden Special Characters of FFT\_____________
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


I'm going to give you a short biography on each of the 5 characters.
Background information 'n' such.  Quite a bit of it I got from the Record
and the rest I pieced together from in-game scenes.


-2.1 Worker 8-


Class: Steel Giant
Sex: N/A
Zodiac Sign: Gemini
Skillset: Work
Class Bonuses: Inherent Innocent, Counter, Any Weather, Any Ground,
               Defense UP, cannot enter water
Class Equips: none (monster)


Worker 8 is a relic from Saint Ajora's time when airships flew in the
sky and humanoid robots helped man.  Steel Giants were demolition
androids used to raze buildings and lift heavy objects.  Worker 8's
power comes from the Aquarius Zodiac Stone.  In its unpowered state,
Worker 8 resembles a large metal ball.  This ball was unearthed from
beneath Goug Machine City by Besrodio Bunanza and subsequently powered
up by the Aquarius Zodiac Stone found in the mines beneath Goland Coal
City.  Worker 8 acknowledges Ramza as its master and follows his commands
without question.  As a robot, Worker 8 has no belief in God.  Thus,
Faith-based magic does not work on him (as Faith is belief in God.)


-2.2 Beowulf Kadmas-


Class: Temple Knight
Sex: Male
Zodiac Sign: Libra
Skillset: Magic Sword
Class Bonuses: Inherent Equip Knight Sword
Class Equips: Swords, Knight Swords, Armor, all non-female accessories


Beowulf was a Temple Knight working for the Glabados Church.  Note the
"was."  He fell in love with a woman named Reis Dular.  Unfortunately, a
Glabados priest, Buremonda, also had feelings for Reis.  But Reis had
eyes only for Beowulf.  Consumed with rage, Buremonda attempted to cast a
spell on Beowulf.  At the last second, Reis blocked the spell for Beowulf
and she was transformed into the Holy Dragon.  Reis ran off, and Beowulf
left the Temple Knights to find her and hopefully find a way to return
her to her human form.  Beowulf meets Ramza and co. in the bar at Lesalia
Castle.  They decide to investigate the rumors of monsters in the coal
mines together, since the description of one of the monsters bears a
striking resemblance to a Holy Dragon...


-2.3 Reis Dular-


Class: Holy Dragon/Dragoner
Sex: Female
Zodiac Sign: Pisces
Skillset: Breath/Dragon
Class Bonuses: Inherent Two Swords, Train, Monster Skill (as Dragoner)
Class Equips: none (Holy Dragon)
              Bags, Ribbons, Perfumes, Armlets (as Dragoner)


Reis was employed by the Glabados Church.  She fell in love with Beowulf
Kadmas, a Temple Knight.  She was also the object of lust for a Glabados
Priest named Buremonda.  Buremonda attempted to curse Beowulf for his
love for Reis but Reis intercepted the spell and turned into a Holy
Dragon.  She then fled the Church and, one way or another, wound up
beneath Goland Coal City, where an Archaic Demon and his Plague lackeys
attacked her.  Ramza and Beowulf rescued her, and defeating the Demon
yielded the Aquarius Zodiac Stone.  After defeating Worker 7 *NEW at
Nelveska Temple, Reis was able to return to her human form using the
Cancer Zodiac Stone.  She and Beowulf decided to stay with Ramza in his
quest to defeat the Lucavi.


-4.4 Cloud Strife-


Class: SOLDIER
Sex: Male
Zodiac Sign: Aquarius
Skillset: Limit
Class Bonuses: Can equip Ribbons even though he is male
Class Equips: Swords, Hats, Ribbons, Clothes, all non-female accessories


Yes, it is Cloud from Final Fantasy VII.  After retrieving the Cancer
Zodiac Stone, Ramza inserted it into another machine excavated from
Goug: the Celestial Globe.  The energy of the stone reached across
time and space and pulled Cloud from his home world to Ivalice.
Nobody knows if this is the real Cloud or one of his memory clones from
within the Lifestream.  After being summoned, Cloud runs off to defeat
Sephiroth.  Ramza and co. find him at Zarghidas Trade City, protecting
a flower girl named Aeris from a gang of brigands.  After slaying the
villains, Cloud joins the party in an attempt to find a way home.
Unlike all the other characters (excluding Agrias and Mustadio), Cloud
starts at Level 1 instead of at the level of the highest party member.


-4.5 Byblos (name varies in the game)-


Class: Byblos
Sex: N/A
Zodiac Sign: varies
Skillset: Byblos
Class Bonuses: Inherent Counter, Secret Hunt, and Ignore Height, cannot
               enter water
Class Equips: none (monster)


Not much is known about the enigmatic Byblos.  This one seems to be the
last of its kind and does not reproduce.  The Byblos appears on the final
level of Deep Dungeon, END, during the fight with Elidibs, possessor
of the 13th Zodiac Stone, Serpentarius (the Sign of Neutrality.)  Elidibs
senses the energy released by the Zodiac Stones that Ramza is carrying, and
he wants them, so he attacks.  Byblos shows up to lend the team a helping
hand...err...claw. After the battle, the Byblos joins your team (if he
survives and is not crystallized/chestized.) He has sharp claws, a long
skinny tail, stands on two feet, and closely resembles an Apanda.



                     _________________________________________________
____________________/3. Getting the Hidden Characters in 17 Easy Steps\___
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


-3.1 Getting Yon Specials!-


Here are the steps to get ALL the special hidden characters (Worker 8,
Beowulf, Reis, Cloud, and Byblos.)

Requirements:

MUST BE IN CHAPTER 4

The biggest requirement: MUSTADIO MUST BE IN THE PARTY

(HE CANNOT HAVE BEEN CRYSTALLIZED/CHESTIZED/DISMISSED)

The reason: Many of these events center around excavations at Goug Machine
City that Besrodio does.  If Mustadio is gone, his father (Besrodio) won't
help you.

If he isn't in the party, start a new game or start at an old save.  Or
use a GameShark/FFTEdit/FFTastic to get him in the party.

Also, whenever you head for the Goug area from the north, I suggest you
save before crossing Bariaus Hill.  I would hate to see people working
on this quest for an hour or two only to be wiped out by the powerful
enemies in the Bariaus Hill Super Monster Battle.

THE STEPS:

1) Anytime in Chapter 4, head to Goug Machine City and view the "Steel
Ball" Scene.  Besrodio comments that the Steel ball is unpowered.  It has
an Aquarius sign etched into its surface.

2) See the rumor at Goland Coal City's bar about monsters underground, and
you return to the World Map.

3) Meet Beowulf at Lesalia Castle's bar.  He's interested in exploring the
coal mines, and Ramza decides to go with him.  Once you return to the
world map, Goland Coal City has turned into a red dot, signifying a story
batle.  What you'll face, however, is a battle series, so prepare
accordingly.

4) Go underground Goland and fight the Underground Colliery Battles.
Eventually, you will have to save Reis (the purple dragon) from the
Archaic Demon and Plagues.  You get the Aquarius Zodiac Stone.
Beowulf and Reis (the Holy Dragon) join up.  It's not the "true" Reis.

5) Go back to Goug and re-energize the Steel Ball using Aquarius.
Worker 8 joins the party, and Ramza issues his first command to a Steel
Giant, with hilarious results.  Continue the game until you can get to
Zeltennia Castle.

6) Unlock Nelveska Temple area at Zeltennia through rumor at bar.  Despite
the red dot, there's no battle here yet (as noticed if you go to the dot,
nothing happens.)  Just continue the game.

7) Buy Aeris' flower at Zarghidas Trade City (plot event, there's only
1 chance to do so, it is on the way to Limberry Castle to fight Elmdor.
(It's just 1 gil! Buy it!)

8) Return to Goug Machine City.  Besrodio has unearthed a new toy.  This
strange device has a Cancer sign inscribed on it and is called a
"Celestial Globe."

9) Go back to Nelveska Temple.  The battle will now occur, the only
battle there ever.  Fight Worker 7 *NEW (don't forget the 4 great items!)
After the battle, you win the Cancer Zodiac Stone (Worker 7 *NEW's power
source.)

10) Try to leave and Reis regains her humanity by Cancer's power.  A
touching reunion between lovers ensues (don't worry, nothing
explicit.)

11) Take the Cancer stone to Goug and summon Cloud from the Celestial
Globe--he runs off (nothing you can do.)

12) Continue the main quest until you reach the battles at Igros Castle.
Defeat the Zodiac Demon Adramelk within the castle and the next leg of the
journey will open up.

13) Return to Zarghidas Trade City, view the scene, and save Cloud
from the thieves.  Cloud joins up.  Retrieve his Materia Blade (the
very top of Bervenia Volcano (Move-Find with low Brave) in order to use
his Limits.

14) Play until you defeat Vampiric Zalbag at Murond Holy Place.

15) Go to Warjilis Trade City and view the rumor about a Deep Dungeon.

16) Play the Deep Dungeon (don't miss the awesome items on every
level.)

17) Defeat Elidibs at END (learn Zodiac for your Summoner, it's now or
never) and recruit the uber-Apanda, Byblos.

THAT'S IT!  You should now have Worker 8, Beowulf, Reis (human,)
Cloud, and Byblos in your party.  Congrats!

If you want info on their powers, then read on...



                     _________________________________
____________________/4. The Hidden Specials' Skillsets\___________________
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


Here are the skillsets for the hidden special characters, including
damage formulas (THANK YOU AEROSTAR!)

First, the basics of how to read this.


-4.1 How to Read the Charts-


Attack Name: The name of the skill, as listed in the Skillset.

MP Cost: The amount of MP expended using the ability.

Ctr.: "Clockticks til resolution" (how long before attack is executed)

***Range: The RANGE of an attack is the number of squares, counted in a
straight line, that the attack has the potential to target (not counting
the caster himself).  It is represented on the screen when an attack is
selected by red, glowing panels.

Usually, Range is independent of vertical height, but for some skills
(e.g., TALK SKILL), it can be limited by height difference.  If this is
so, it will be noted in the handbook with a "vX" after the range number,
where X is the vertical tolerance of the attack in height units.  For
instance, the range of 'Threaten' is 3v2.  - The EFFECT AREA of an attack
determines which panels will actually be hit by the attack.  It is
determined by counting the number of squares an attack can hit from the
center to one corner of the effect area.  Effect area is usually
restricted by vertical height.  Height restrictions will be noted in
the guide with "vX" appended on to the effect number, with X being the
vertical tolerance of the attack in height units.  For instance, the
effect area of 'Haste 2' is 2v3.

A combination of range and effect area is used to determine the attack's
firing range.  We represent this in the guide as two numbers, the first
being the range and the second the effect area.  For instance, a spell
with firing range {5/1} means it has a range of 5 and an effect area of
1. If there is an effect area greater than one, it can make the attack
go further than the range.

~~~

MATHEMATICAL FUNCTIONS

* signifies multiplication

/ signifies division

[X] means to truncate X -- that is, convert X to a decimal and then drop
all decimal places, regardless of what numbers they contain. For
instance, [3.001] = 3; [3.999] = 3; [0.556] = 0; [-0.872] = 0;
[-7.25] = -7. Note that this differs from the greatest integer (floor)
function in its treatment of negative numbers: [-9.1] = -9 while
floor(-9.1) = -10. FFT uses truncation, not floor.

RU{X}, the round-up function, means to truncate X and add 1 to the
absolute value of X, while maintaining X's sign. That is,
RU{X} = [X] + |X|/X. This means that if X is positive, RU{X} = [X] + 1,
but if X is negative, RU{X} = [X] - 1.

max{x,y} = (x if x > y) or (y if y > x)

min{x,y} = (x if x < y) or (y if y < x)

(x..y) means that the game generates a random integer between x and y,
inclusive

~~~

{NOTE: Magic that depends on faith and causes a special effect -- such as
a status abnormality, a reduction in stats, or a reduction in HP by a set
percentage -- is governed by this equation:

success % = [CFa/100 * TFa/100 * (MA + Y)] * (evasion factor)}

where Y is a percentage multiplier peculiar to the spell

CFa is the caster's faith

TFa is the target's faith

Evasion factor = (1 - (target's M.SEV)) * (1 - (target's M.AEV)).

~~~

JP cost: How much JP is required to learn the ability

Effect: The formula for calculating the damage/effect done by the
attack.

The % sign represents the % chance for the attack to hit.

-5.1 Notes on How To Read-

I made setups currently for Beowulf, Reis, and Cloud in avariety of job
classes. I obviously did not include Worker 8 and Byblos as they are not
customizable in normal gamepley (i.e. without GameShark, FFTEdit, FFTastic,
or other editors.)

Feel free to submit setups THAT ARE PROVEN IN BATTLE TO BE GOOD. I may
include setups for all Specials at a later date.

*****THIS SECTION IS A WORK IN PROGRESS*****

Setups will alwyas be given in the following format:

Job
Suggested Brave/Faith

Primary Ability
Secondary Ability
Reaction Ability
Support Ability
Movement Ability

Equip in Left Hand
Equip in Right Hand
Headgear
Body Gear
Accessory

((Short description on the use of the setup))

All of the abbreviations listed in [4.3] are the same.


-5.2 Beowulf Kadmus-

Temple Knight
Brave 97, Faith 94

Magic Sword
Time Magic
Blade Grasp
Short Charge
Teleport

Excalibur
Escutcheon II
Grand Helm
Robe of Lords
Magic Gauntlet

This setup takes full advantage of Beowulf's high MA and Faith. Both his
magic abilities rely on the high Faith, and the MA boosts from Robe of
Lords and Magic Gauntlet allow Magic Sword and Time Magic statuses to hit
with close to 100% accuracy. Also, Meteor will do incredible damage. Short
Charge is really for Time Magic, as Magic Sword is inherently non-charged.
Excalibur gives auto-Haste, Robe of Lords gives Protect and Shell, and
the Escutcheon II + Blade Grasp makes assault from all sides a waste of a
turn. The only possible problem is that magic will be incredibly effective
on Beowulf, but the Shell effect should help with that. Basically a strong
mage and possible frontline fighter.


-5.3 Reis Dular-

Dragoner
Brave 97, Faith 94

Dragon
Math Skill (all magic known)
Counter Magic
Equip Sword
Move +2/Teleport

Rune Blade
Rune Blade
Ribbon
--
Chantage

This is one of the mage Reis setups. Reis can really do anything. She has
naturally high PA, MA, HP...she's an all-around badass. Math Skill hits
everything, Dragon of course to convert enemy units or beef up allied
dragons. Counter Magic is nice since any spell can be countered. 2 Rune
Blades give +4 MA and more decent physical punch. Ribbon + Chantage
essentially makes her invincible to status and immortal.


Dragoner

Brave 97 Faith 03

Dragon
Punch Art
Counter
Martial Arts
Move +2

(bare fist)
(bare fist)
Ribbon
--
Setiemson

Dragoner Reis has innately high PA, MA, HP. She lacks speed, but the Haste
from Setiemson can help out with that...and starting Transparent. Punch Art +
Martial Arts is a killer, especially on Reis. The high Brave enhances the
bare fist damage even more. Counter basically ensures anything in her range
that attacks her will get a chunk of HP taken out of it. Her naturally high
HP makes killing her difficult, and she has Chakra just in case. Ribbon, of
course, for status immunity. Basically a frontline Reis.



-5.4 Cloud Strife-

SOLDIER

Brave 94, Faith 60

Limit
Draw Out
Blade Grasp
Short Charge
Move +3

Rune Blade
--
Ribbon
Rubber Costume
Genji Gauntlet

Short Charge makes Limit come off at a reasonable time, and Ribbon
prevents all negative statuses. The Materia Blade is crappy for
attacking but necessary for Limit, so meh. Rubber Costume is
almost exclusively for the HP boost. Draw Out to give positive
statuses to self (Masamune and Kiyomori come to mind,) and for instant
damage. Blade Grasp basically to evade the inevitable attacks. The
low-ish Faith makes healing slightly tricky but prevents too much damage
from enemy mages.


Geomancer

Brave 97, Faith 80

Elemental
Draw Out
Auto-Potion
Two Swords
Teleport

Rune Blade
Rune Blade
Flash Hat
Wizard Robe
Genji Gauntlet

A classic hybrid unit. Elemental allows long range strikes, and Draw Out
is incredibly versatile. The dual Rune Blades, Flash Hat, Wizard Robe, and
Genji Gauntlet really boost MA (by 9!), which affects both Elemental and Draw
Out.
In addition, the Gauntlet enhances PA by 2, which affects Elemental. Cloud
in this form can take the front, strike from long range, or hit in an area
around him. Teleport gets him right where he needs to be, and Auto-Potion
helps heal before a Murasame is necessary. Faith allows for magical healing.
Incredibly versatile.

-5.1 Frequently Asked Questions-


1. Q: How come Reis' Dragon Tame/Care/LevelUp/PowerUp always has a 0%
success rate when I target one of my characters with it?

   A: It only works on Dragon-type and Hydra-type monsters.

2. Q: What's the best way to level up Cloud?

   A: If you have extremely high level allies, let him pound on them
      and he'll gain a level every few turns.  Cast Haste and/or Yell on
      him to speed up the process.  It's possible to level him from level
      1 to 70 in just one battle, since he does so little damage to them
      at low levels.

3. Q: How can you POSSIBLY say someone what starts as Level 1 can be
      useful?  I don't want to level him all the way up!

   A: OK, fine.  Cloud IS one of the strongest warriors in the game,
      though, if you put enough work into him.  SOLDIER Job has nice
      growth.

4. Q: If Beowulf's attacks are Swordskills, how come Faith is in the
      equation?

   A: They're basically just spells with no charge time, and have the same
      formulas and damage rules as all other spells.  They only have the
      added requirement of needing a Sword/Knight Sword equipped to cast.

5. Q: What is this Super Monster Battle at Bariaus Hill you mentioned?

   A: It's a rare battle in which you face one Dragon, one Blue Dragon,
one Red Dragon, one Behemoth, one King Behemoth, one Dark Behemoth, one
Hyudra, one Hydra, and one Chocobo of a random color.  The enemies are
usually quite a bit higher levelled than you are.  That's why I suggest
you save, they can wipe unprepared parties out easily.  If you have human
Reis, she can Invite 5 of the enemies to your side with Dragon Tame and
turn the tide quickly.  You also have a few Guests of the types listed
above to help you out.  Just always remember to save before going south
through the hill and you'll be fine.

6. Q: Why can't Cloud perform his Limits after I learn them?

   A: He MUST be equipped with a Materia Blade to use Limit.  The one
Materia Blade you can find is located on top of Bervenia Volcano, just
south of Riovanes Castle.  Bervenia Volcano appears at the start of
Chapter 4.  Get your Move-Finder in a class with good Jump and Speed stats
(like Ninja or Thief) and tack on a pair of Germinas Boots for the extra
boost. Once at Bervenia Volcano, you should notice the peak is extremely
high up. The very top peak is your goal where the Materia Blade awaits.

7. Q: How do I get to the next Deep Dungeon level? I beat the battle but
there's no new level?!

   A: You have to find the exit, which appears randomly on one of five
possible squares. Once you find the exit and beat the battle, the next
level opens up. I know what you're thinking..."Where are the exit squares?"
Check out the "Deep Dungeon Exits FAQ." It never failed me.

8. Q: What are some good setups for these characters?

   A: I've put a couple in, but that section is nowhere near complete.
I'll be adding more at a later date.  Ask on the board for now.


-5.2 Version History-


Version 1.1 (Sunday, March 10, 2002): Yes, I DID write this entire thing
in one day.  No, I didn't have anything better to do.  Well, I did...but
this won out once I started it.  I'm contemplating adding decent set-ups
for these characters and such at a later date, and maybe adding the other
Special Characters at some point.  Hmm...

(Friday, March 15, 2002): Made a couple changes, re-sent the guide.
It actually got posted this time.  =P

Version 1.2 (Monday, April 1, 2002): FFT is the worst.  Game.  EVAR.
April Fool's! =P  Sending updated Guide, and I plan to work on setups
in the near future.

Version 1.3 (Friday, January 3, 2003): Wow, I've been neglectful. Added
a FEW setups. Many more to follow. Sorry for the wait. =)


-5.3 Thank You!-


I would like to take this time to thank:

AeroStar, for letting me use his Battle Mechanics Guide formulas...this
is what?  The 5th or so time I've thanked him in the guide?  Well he
deserves it, he's one of the TRUE FFT Legends.  Also to everyone else
who worked on the BMG, I know AeroStar wasn't the only one.

CJayC for posting my FAQ even though the FFT FAQ page is pretty damn full.

Ex Soldier Cloud for pointing out that you can get Dragoner Reis before
beating Adramelk.  Well, I _THINK_ it was ESC... O_o

Mooglelicious, MunkiBleedsGreen, Lew Uber Alles, and the rest of my
friends on the Final Fantasy Tactics Social Board for not letting me
become a 100% bitter vet. 95% is enough.

Philsov and superaielman, for pointing out flaws right after the FAQ was
put up.  Woo for revisions.

nova314 for keeping me sane on long nights with humor and innuendo.

Square Electronics (for making this game!  Yay!)

Everyone who posts (intelligently) at the Final Fantasy Tactics Main
