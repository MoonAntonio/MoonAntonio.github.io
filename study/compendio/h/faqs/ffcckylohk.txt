1. Introduction [FFCC1]
------------------------
It has been a whole 7 years since Square has parted from Nintendo's main 
consoles. At that time, I was still young, and I had absolutely no idea 
what Final Fantasy is all about. I really do not like turn based RPGs, 
as they are just ridiculous. However, Square this time is so kind to make 
a Final Fantasy, just for the Nintendo Gamecube. It is not a numbered Final 
Fantasy series, but it has its own name, Crystal Chronicles. It also has 
its own unique gameplay style. Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles is an 
action based RPG, which featured similar gameplay mechanics to that of 
Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. People who have played Wind Waker should 
feel at home with the controls.

Another unique aspect of Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles is that it makes 
use of GBA Connectivity. No, Game Boy Advances are not required to play 
this game, however, they do make a good optional extras to the game. Another 
unique feature is that Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles is the one and 
only multiplayer Final Fantasy out there. In order to play a multiplayer 
game, you MUST make use of GBA connectivity. I find myself lucky to own 
a Gameboy Advance and a Gameboy Advance SP at the same time, hence I can 
play a 2 player game with my friends. Nintendo is nice to include this 
feature because they are quite right with the assumption that most people 
who own GCNs also own a GBA. Besides, GBA connectivity helped me a lot 
in writing this guide. Without the connectivity, there is no way I could 
have been able to know the HP values and vulnerabilities of all those 
monsters in the game!(In my opinion, people who whine about having to buy 
link cables and all are just being stingy and ridiculous.) Now, let's get 
started to the Getting Started Section of the Strategy Guide.

For your information, this guide's strategies for the entire world is 
complete. Now, I have added some optional extras like the diary entires 
and letters my characters received. This helps to have a more indepth look 
on the story. Certain Lists are provided in the middle of the strategy 
guide and at the back of the guide, while some will only appear as Appendices. 
As Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles is a multiplayer game, I will add 
some strategies on how to deal with the bosses in all the levels in a 2 
player games. I believe the strategies can easily be mirrored in 3 player 
and 4 player games. 

Oh, and I believe some sections of this guide are rich in spoilers. They 
are marked with an asterisk in the contents. If you do not want the plot 
spoiled, do not read those sections. Besides, certain parts of my guides 
are lists, they are marked with a double asterisk. Do not read them if 
you do not need to know about too much detail about the things mentioned.

Finally, I must say that the spellcheck function of Microsoft Word has 
failed due to too many spelling mistakes, caused by all those fictional 
characters and names. So if there are any typos you see, feel free to notify 
me, as it is hard to spell check a 568 page document without the help of 
the Word Processor. Now, it's time for over 1MB of fun for all of you!

Thank you.

a. Health Warning [FFCC1A]
---------------------------
ALASDAIR LO'S HEALTH WARNING: READING TOO MUCH OF A LONG GUIDE IS HAZARDOUS 
TO YOUR HEALTH!
MEDIUM TO HIGH TEXT

I just noticed that this guide has become rather big, having occupied 560 
pages in Microsoft Word and counting, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND READING THE 
ENTIRE GUIDE FROM TOP TO BOTTOM, as it will just hurt your eyes. Instead, 
consider just reading the section that you will want the most strategies 
from. I have instated a Search Key system so that you can easily jump to 
the part of the guide you want to read. The search key is denoted by the 
code enclosed inside 2 square brackets. Each key first has FFCC, which 
stands for the game, the number denoting the chapter, the letter denoting 
the section, and the number denoting the subsection. Just copy and paste 
the whole thing into the Search Function of your browser, and click Find 
Next. Understood?

There are certain parts of the guide that are very very similar to each 
other, like Chapters 3f, 3g, 4biii, 4biv and 4eiii, they are all covered 
in Appendix II: Game Encyclopedia.If you are reading this guide just for 
some basic stats of the features, just type [A2] in the Search Function, 
and click Find Next. It's either read up to Appendix I, or read Appendix 
II only. Get the point?

For people who know the basics and want to read the guide from the start 
of the game, I suggest you jump immediately to the Search Key [FFCC3J].

Finally, I would like to state that the walkthroughs are made in a way 
that they cover every last detail of the game, so that not a single thing 
can be missed. So, you may be surprised at the lengths of the walkthroughs 
for each level, so if you feel annoyed or whatever, just use the Search 
Keys to jump to the level you want to read about, and that's it! Ctrl + 
F is your friend!

-----------------------------
b. About the Author [FFCC1B]
-----------------------------
Yes, my name is Alasdair Lo, and I currently live in Hong Kong, a very 
crowded city in southern China. I have been writing guides since I have 
graduated from Form 5 (Middle School) with very good results, (All As in 
my best 6 subjects), and am now in High School. 

I contribute a lot to my school, I was the Chief Editor of my school's 
yearbook, and when I was in Form 6, I was the Vice Chairman of the Journalism 
Club of my school, and a Chairman of the English Society, as well as the 
Secretary of the Chemistry Society.

I basically like to play and write guides for Adventure games, and this 
game is not an exception. I also like to play platformers like Mario. I 
love to eat at KFC more than McDonald's and I just love to listen to techno 
music. It's just a pity that there is NOT a single Burger King in Hong 
Kong, and we only have Hardee's, so that really is a bit lame as Burger 
King's burgers taste a lot better than those at McDonald's. Garfield is 
my favorite comic book character. Of course, I have a wild imagination 
and do like Chemistry. As for other non-newspaper comics, I prefer Asterix, 
because his ruthless beating up of the Romans with his best friend Obelix 
is just so funny, and it inspires me to beat the enemies ruthlessly in 
video games as well! It all goes well in First Person Shooters and Real 
Time Strategy games in particular!

I do have a high EQ, Emotional Quotient, as I am able to stay calm and 
not lose my temper even at the worst situations. Of course, if people cannot 
respect me when I speak to them nicely, I must be sterner in dealing with 
them. Of course, I can handle constructive criticism, but of course, 
destructive criticism is NOT TOLERATED. Do not send me e-mails saying how 
much of a loser I am sitting in my basement, It's similar to giving me 
a verbal assault, and is not tolerated in where I live. (There are no 
basement apartments anyway.) Otherwise, I quote my Physics teacher, "Not 
constructive! Stay behind (after school)!". You don't have to stay behind, 
but I WILL BLOCK YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS if you do offend me in any way, and 
you can never mail anything to me again. Yes, and even if you have read 
this guide and are not satisfied with a part, do not ask me to go to hell! 
I'm there already. Tee hee... (This comes as a joke I read on a Medicins 
San Frontieres (a charitiable organization "Doctors without Borders") 
poster, saying "When we ask you to donate money, don't ask use to go to 
hell! We are there already!") An example has been made in Complaint one 
below, and I hope you will try your best not to be like him.

-------------------------------------------------------
c. Corrections, Complaints and Clarifications [FFCC1C]
--------------------------------------------------------
Well, as I said, no one is perfect, not even me, and my guide receives 
praises most of the time, but I did receive some letters of complaint from 
some readers, and hence it would not hurt to write them out here. If anything 
you would like to complain about is already listed, I hope I have already 
answered your question in this section. Besides, I usually will answer 
questions from readers at the end of the guide, but as this guide is so 
long, I think that it will be necessary to answer them in the front of 
the guide, guaranteeing everyone to be able to read them.

Complaint 1: Chuck Richard's Complaint
First, let me compliment you on such a well written guide. It was very 
helpful, full of detail and actually useful information. Sir, you did it 
right. I did have one question though. Why did you put that section on 
"funny stuff"? None of that was funny. The fact that you put it in there 
and analytically detailed the game, comparing it to real life, that was 
dumb. It's a fantasy game. Nothing is gonna seem real. Emphasis on the 
"...game... it isn't real...", as in, it's a game and isn't real. (1) And 
100 hours!?! Dude, get a life, or a girl, or another game. It was an awesome 
game, yeah, but not that great. You really came off as some loser Chinese 
kid who's 27 and in his parents' basement with a laptop and GameCube and 
a mattress. (2) Anywho, so long and thanks for all the fish. And the help. 
Thanks. Get a life.

Analysis of this letter:
(1) Chuck Richards seemed to be complaining that Chapter 7a is NOT funny 
because "Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles" is JUST a fantasy game, and 
none of that is supposed to be real.

(2) This guy here, thinks I have NO LIFE because I have played the same 
game for over 100 hours, and says I am a kid who lives in his parent's 
basement and blah blah blah...

My Answers:
(1) Well, have you read the comic book Asterix? Well, it's a very fictional 
comic book that twisted the real events of history in Ancient Rome. However, 
they do make a lot of references to the real world. Of course, it's not 
real as it is not possible to have such real world stuff back then. But 
people still laugh at these obviously unreal things.

Besides, I believe that no matter how much fantasy a fantasy game has, 
there MUST be a logical threshold for all the sequences. If some thing 
is too illogical even for a Fantasy Game, be it a designing flaw or whatever, 
I still find it to be funny. It's just like those people who laugh at Resident 
Evil, another unreal game for being unrealistic, like having no toilets, 
and Chris Redfield being an air force veteran at the age of 25 and so on.

Anyway, I use funny to describe anything that is weird, so let's not argue 
semantics here, shall we?

(2) Ho ho ho, you seem to be lacking a lot of common sense here. First 
off, Hong Kong is a VERY CROWDED CITY, flats are even more expensive than 
the price of an average house in the United States, and in much higher 
supply than the houses. Therefore, many people live in flats, and I am 
not an exception. CAN FLATS HAVE BASEMENTS? NO! I live rather high up, 
so there is always light. And, for your information, I am only 18 when 
I finished this guide, read About the Author section to find more about 
me. As for why I have played this game for 100+ hours, it's because, I 
FIND IT FUN! Besides, I only own a GCN, and I sometimes buy games once 
every 2-3 months! Of course, I do have a life. Read above to find out. 
Let this be a lesson to all of you people out there who like to make false 
assumptions about people. So there.

Complaint 2: Henrik Eriksson's Complaint
Hello Alasdair Lo, i read most part of your Final Fantasy: Chronicles faq, 
and i think its pretty good with a few exeptions, the things i would complain 
about is the many missspellings and much repetive material (1), like the 
item description, but ofcouse i can forgive you that, its damn much content 
^^.

Well i saw you had take Chris in your FAQ and answered somthing you think 
he just had killed the skeleton mage and just needed to wait for its respawn. 
I dont think he ment that, I think he ment as i have encountered also a 
big problems with the elemental switch, the fact that you need to get the 
effected from the spell, like you need to get "burn" state on the switch 
for the next door to open and "Iced" state on the switch for the door infront 
to open.

I myself was equiped with lighting belt and frost armor, that means i ain't 
got a chans to procced the way to the boss at "Rebena Te Ra". Of course 
this problem could be solved by always having two accessoaries or other 
affect resist units.

Analysis:
(1) He seems to think my guide has a lot of spelling mistakes, and repetitive 
material.

My Answer:
(1) Well, typos really cannot be avoided, this is because Microsoft Word's 
spellcheck got an error because it "detected too many mistakes" due to 
all the fictionary characters I typed in, hence I could not tell where 
the typos are. With this guide being so large and all, finding typos without 
spellcheck is a thankless job. As for the repetitiveness, I expect no one 
to read past Appendix I. If they do read Appendix II, they would not be 
reading the main portion of my guide. This is why I will add a subsection 
in Chapter 1 called "Guide to Reading this Guide".

Question 1: Tom's Question
Hi great guide, quick question though. I am playing single player. If I 
play more than 1 charactor, is my EXP split up so my chars end up less 
powerful, or can I build them all up very high? Thank you.

(do I lose anything from playing multiple charactors.)

Thanks 
Tom

My Answer:
There is absolutely NO EXP in this game. Instead, you are given Artifacts 
that boost 1 stat at a time. Whenever you beat a level, each character 
is given bonus points, depending on how they have fulfilled their bonus 
requirements. The player with the most points gets to choose his/her 
artifacts first.

Question 2: DragonQuest's (Pseudonym) Questions
First Question:
Would you be so kind as to give some nice tips for getting the Celestial 
Weapon Scroll from Kilanda.
 
I made sure I'm in Cycle 3 for both and tried so hard in Kilanda to get 
214 but I keep coming up with 160-190 points even with bonuses like "inflict 
damage" or "take physical damage".  For the inflict damage bonus, I went 
and killed every single enemy in the level and still ended up in 
the 180s.  For take physical damage, I spent like three hours just curing 
myself from physical attack done by the enemy and ended up in the 160s.
 
I also took advice from another faq which was to not collect any artifacts 
and just go straight to the boss but that didn't work either.
 
From the Player's Guide, I saw that I need four players so I went and 
borrowed a few GBA SP's and still I am unsuccessful. I've played for hours 
and now I'm desperate for any clues to get this item besides using something 
like a GameShark.
 
Thank you so much for any help.
 
PS. If there's any tips you have for getting Dragon's Fang from that Dragon 
Zombie that will help me too.

My Answer:
There are two ways to get a lot of points from Mt. Kilanda. Firstly, when 
you face the Lava Ahrimans, DO NOT USE Gravity, but just hit and run those 
things. Then, the Lava Ahriman can take more hits, and the more hits you 
deal, the more points you get. (You get 1 point per hit) Another way is, 
when you face the Iron Giant, do not defeat him quickly. When he has only 
1 thread of HP left, start going after the Goblin Mages. They respawn 
endlessly, again, you can rack up points this way by repeatedly killing 
those enemies.

If you have fulfilled the point requirement, you will have a 25% chance 
of being able to select the Celestial Weapon design. So, don't be surprised 
if you cannot select the weapon. Keep doing it and you will eventually 
get it. The same goes for the Dragon Fang. You again will have a 25% chance 
of being able to select it. So, keep trying.

Second Question:
I found out that it is a lot easier to get the 214 points from Kilanda 
since points are cummulative. I had originally thought one player was 
suppose to accumulate 214 points before the set could have a chance of 
appearing.  However, after reading the Strategy Guide more carefully, I 
found out that points are cummulative.  Therefore the Celestial Weapon 
is much easier to get with more players assumming each player has a good 
bonus.  If I were to give advice to another player, I would also also 
definitely recommend not collecting too many artifacts as that could lower 
the chance of getting items from the set such as Masamune, Red Eye, 
Celestial Weapon, etc.  Thanks for all your help.  After playing Kilanda 
more than 20 times, I was finally able to retrieve the dumb scoll.
 
If you have the time, please see if you can answer some of these questions:
 
1. Why can't my family blacksmith forge any of my equipment or accessories 
even though all my family members are happy? 
 
2. How can you tell what production level you family is at?
 
3. What are best things to do to raise an Alchemist and Blacksmith's 
production and happiness level?
 
4. Where's the best place to make money besides the 400,000 GP quest? (would 
it be Conal Currach because of the Oricalcums?)

My Answer:
OK, let me answer the questions one by one.

1. Firstly, your family blacksmith can only forge certain weapons and armor, 
and they cannot forge accessories. What they can forge is listed in my 
guide. Besides, you will have to please your family continuously for a 
couple of years and talk to them as well to improve their production levels.

2. For Blacksmiths:
Take a design for Mythril Armor, Diamond Armor and Greatest Weapon to the 
blacksmith. If he can forge mythril armor, he is at level 1, if he can 
forge Diamond Armor, he is at level 2. If he can forge the Greatest Weapon, 
then congratulations.

For Tailors:
Take a design for accessories of each level to the tailor, and see whether 
he can craft it.

For Alchemists:
If he gives your character a new scroll each year, then he is certainly 
leveling up.

For Merchants:
If you can buy Gold from him, then he is at level 1. If you can buy a Magma 
Rock form him, then he is at level 2. If you can buy Ultimite from him, 
then he is at level 3.

3. Just keep sending in seeds, materials and designs (Particularly seeds). 
Reply positively if the father is sending a letter to you. (He rarely does.) 
Comply with his demands.	

4. Just find rare items like Ancient Potions, spoils from Bosses, and sell 
them. (Each spoil can be sold for 7500 gil.)

Question 3: Willow Cheah's Question
Hey,

Your walkthroughs have been great but i have troubles with a couple of 
things at the Lynari Desert. First, when i cast blizzrd on the boulders 
(from smallest to biggest) nothing happens. I tried every combination for 
casting blizzrard on those boulders. Second, I can't find the flower you 
were talking about. i searched all over and couldn't find it. i need that 
unknown element to pass through to the final stage. Plz help me. Thnx

My Answer:
Casting Blizzard on those boulders doesn't work, eh? Have you tried 
following the other tips later, and did anything happen?

Question 4: Chibi Tetra's Question
Near the end of your walkthrough, in the final area, you said that you 
had to have over 70 basic stats. None of mine are close to that and it's 
the 7th year...what should I do? 
 
Thank you for reading this

My Answer:
I was only recommending the stats. You DON'T HAVE to have such high stats. 
In fact, my stats were at their 60s when I beat the game for the first 
time.

You can always try to beat Raem with low stats as a challenge.

To improve stats, find artifacts, and forge newer weapons and armor.

Question 5: Mike Sciortino's Question
Hi. The names Mike. I took a little break from this game and recently came 
back since I haven't beat it yet. I have been working on getting the best 
weapons and I have the guide but one thing confuses me. In it it says that 
only certain things can be obtained in Cycles 1, 2 or 3. How do you change 
the cycles and how will you know when you do? If you don't know would you 
know anyone who might?

My Answer:
For the first time you beat a level, it will be on Cycle 1. Then you wait 
2 years for the myrrh tree to replenish. Then you will be in Cycle 2. Beat 
the level again and wait 2 more years, then it will be in Cycle 3, permanently. 
Then, there is no way for you to come back to Cycles 1 or 2. Fortunately, 
all Artifacts can be found at Cycle 3 of different levels.

Observation 1: Henrik's Observation
Note: This is his first name, my e-mail program cannot read the accents 
on his surname. He is describing his observation about the Lynari Desert.
No problem mate.

By the way i just played FF:CC in Lynari desert a couple of times and 
discovered that Zus drop orchicalium about 1/52 times at least for me. 
I also discovered a glitch in the desert, to get the secret element you 
need to do the stuff about the rocks, cactus, the shelter and the mushroom 
rock, well the point is if you die without a phoenix down or head for the 
black screen with the options to exit the desert or return, sometimes it 
happens that when you cast lighting on the cactus there is no effect. I 
tried several of things to remove this problem, like repeating, casting 
thundara or thundaga, casting from diffrent of angels, but nothing seems 
to work. The only way to get the cactus back to normal seem to be exit 
to the world and then return, that can be very annoying if you cleaned 
up the whole place on enemies.

If i find more stuff i will report to you.

As i continue to play I find more things out, still in the Lynari Desert 
I see that the way to get the unknown element is multi path. You don't 
need to do the....what do we call it? The tasking in the desert, in a specific 
order, and also you can do only one of the task then return another time 
and do the others: Like casting fire at the mushroom rock then beat the 
boss, then come there some years later and do the remaining stuff, also  
closely spectated the desert, as most vegetation are in that desert(the 
dead bush textiles around some places) are dead, but there is alive bushes 
or whatever at the position where the unknown elemental pop up, and in 
some other places to like the moogle nest and the "1200 gold treasure chest". 
My belief is that it is only there to confuze the player, if you know there 
should be some live vegetation where the unknown elemental should be you 
may go to wrong place! Well that is just my dumbass theory.

Hope to hear from you soon, by your friend Henrik

Goddamnit man im annoying, sorry for that but i found something else that 
should be corrected in your faq, in chapter -----BOSSES-----(8c or [A2C] 
I think) you write about the Lizard king, You wrote "The Lizard Skirmisher 
will stand on one of them, and will then activate some kind of rolling 
blade out of the ground that will go after your character" to tell you 
the truth it don't go "after" your charater, it actualy goes around in 
the gladiator arena like a groud potato, so you don't realy need to worry 
about getting hit by it if you simply use the "hit boss in back" strategy.

Well I'm very sorry about writing you this much letters, it may seem as 
some sort of spam, I'm realy realy sorry but i got nothing better to do.(Feel 
free to use my letters however you wish and correct any grammar mishaps 
I may have done and/or add/remove information I have written)

My Answer:
Well, everyone can have their own theories, but my experience is different 
in Lynari desert. Of course, I WILL have to correct your grammar mishaps 
due to English not being your first language, must be Swedish.

Another suggestion from Henrik:
Yes of course, I cant remove it :D (although I would want to do that with 
my female players:P just joking) but the point is, no way I'm gonna go 
carrying lots and lots of diffrent weapons or armor with me, becouse did 
they tell me in the game that they recommend you to carry many armors to 
avoid that situation in the ancient city? No way man, so what I think you 
should add to your faq is a ....Recommendation to ITEMS you should ALWAYS 
CARRY with you LIST. OK?
Thx on forehand friend :D
PS. you play any multiplayer game?
Have a good time!

My answer:
Always discard the weaker weapons, and armor, and keep the rest in your 
hands. I will add a priority list in Chapter 3I.

Correction 1 (Star's Correction)
I was reading your faq from gamefaqs.com and noticed another reader was 
having the same problem as myself.. as myself i hate being frozen i was 
wearing frost gloves and frost badge.. so i removed 1 of the items and 
as blizzard was cast on me it opened the switch.. so it looks like you 
can't be "immune" to the freezing and still have it open the switches!

My answer:
OK, I will add a sentence telling people not to be too protected down there.

Correction 2 (Matt Wilson's Correction)
Sorry to bother you again but it has come to my attention that there is 
another error in your math. For Clavets original strength is 7 + 30, Gaia 
plate, + 25, Chocobo shield, +35, all defense artifacts = 97 not 99. This 
is the same with all tribesmen Lilties defense is 92 Silkies is 90 and 
Yukes have 89.

Attached is a home made max tribal stats page I made

My Answer:
So, so. OK, I will take away 2.

Clarification 1: Brian Johnston's Clarification
Hi. 

I've been reading your FAQ (not from start to finish!) and I found it really 
good, so I thought I might send you a few comments. 

1) I to have racked up over 100 hours on the game, there is absolutely 
nothing wrong with that. (1)

2) I've skimmed over some sections, and I haven't noticed anything devoted 
to it, so I thought putting in some info on the focus attacks of specific 
weapons might be useful.  For example, whether you can hit multiple enemies 
as you shoot/dash, etc.  One of the reasons for this, is that I found with 
some focus attacks, usually a Selkie dash/kick type, if your aim is a little 
off to the side or behind, you will tend to push the enemy away as you 
pass it and not hit it.  I just thought some descriptions os focus attacks 
could be useful. 

3) Something for section 7 in the funny stuff.  The Legendary Weapon scroll, 
as you know, makes one of Excalibur, Gungnir, Mystic Hammer, Queen's Heel.  
I don't know what a Queen's Heel is, if anything, but Excalibur is the 
name of King Arthur's sword from Celtic mythology, Gungnir is the name 
of Odin's spear from Norse mythology, and the Yukes get a generic name.  
What is funny is that Mjollnir, which is an artifact, is the name of Thor's 
hammer, from Norse mythology, which is undoubtably a "legendary hammer".  
Why would you use a generic name instead? (2)

If you're intersted, I'm playing in a crazy, hard core kind of way, raising 
8 characters at once. I do play a lot of 2 player though. (3)

Keep up the good work,
Brian.

(1) Playing Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles is like playing Pokemon, 
so it is natural for there to be a long playing time.
(2) It's because Square-Enix is l-a-z-y, perhaps?
(3) Recently, I have beaten the game with the help of Paul. So it's the 
first time I beat the game with 2 players, and it's a cakewalk!

A letter from someone with a pseudonym Swishy:
I read your walkthrough of FF:CC, and I want to give you some feedback 
on it.

First of all, very nice walkthrough.  I found it very helpful, and I enjoyed 
the wit you put into writing it.  I especially liked your replay ideas, 
as those add an extra bit of chalange to the game. The "funny stuff" was 
aptly titled.  

By the way, some of the monsters, like the griffin, are based off of "real" 
mythological creatures, right?  I noted you made mention of reference to 
some of the weapons being named after stories, but not any of the monsters.  
For instance, the griffin was suppose to be a creature that was half eagle, 
half lion.  Or, were you just saving yourself some extra typeage?  (I don't 
blame you for this, I could never see me finishing a walkthrough like that.)

Another note of references:  a Selkie in the game said that "Selkies came 
from the sea, and to the sea they shall return" (I can't remember the name, 
it was a Selkie in Leuda looking over the cliff).  I was wondering to myself:  
is this any reference to the selkies of folklore?  In mythology, selkies 
are suppose to be beings that can turn in to seals and into humans.  I 
wonder if the game writers were making reference to this.  If they were, 
could it have anything to do with the fate of De Nam?

A pondering question also about De Nam:  If monsters were spawned from 
bad/faded memories, then why did De Nam turn into a monster if he's not 
a memory?  Maybe he got eaten, and then the stupid monster picked up his 
hankercheif, just like how other monsters pick up random things (like 
artifacts like "Teddy Bear")  Or, maybe the memory of drinking that awful 
miasma water turned him into a monster...

A question from my sister:  Why is there no such items as "Goblin 
Suspenders?" (Don't try to answer that one...)

Suggestion:  Could you make another section with all the sidequests?  I 
noticed there's a section with all the bosses repeated.  It would be very 
helpful to be able to find all the side quests.

Overall, it was a very good walkthrough. I'll be bookmarking it.  And, 
don't worry about all my questions.  I just put them there to get a load 
off my shoulders.

Swishy

My Answer:
There really is only one side-quest which is rather tedious, so there really 
should not be any need to add an extra side-quest section.

---------------------------
3. Getting Started [FFCC3]
---------------------------
This is where you learn of the story, basics and so on of Final Fantasy: 
Crystal Chronicles.

------------------
a. Story [FFCC3A]
------------------
Prologue:
Seek the water of life.

Long ago, miasma swallowed the world. Its very touch was fatal, and it 
claimed many lives. But we have since discovered a way to hold it at bay.

Crystals protect us from miasma. Smaller crystals now guard the villages 
of the world, while greater ones guard the cities. We all live our lives 
within the embrace of the crystals' blessing.

The power of the crystals is not limitless, however; it gradually 
diminishes over time. We must rekindle the crystals' radiance each year 
by purifying them with myrrh. In turn, they protect us from the miasma 
for another year.

But myrrh cannot be found just anywhere. We must seek it in the dank depths 
of dungeons, across forbidding mountains, even beyond the sea.

This task falls to groups of young men and women sent off each year by 
every town the world over. It is their duty to collect myrrh and bring 
it home. They are known as the crystal caravans.

This is the tale of one such caravan and its adventures.

My note: Superficially, it may seem that this game is lacking in plot. 
However, there really is something hidden in the background. You will find 
many events that can tell the story. While playing the game, you should 
particularly pay attention to the actions of Hurdy and the Black Knight, 
as their fate is very significant when you face your final boss. The 
ultimate objective of this game is to remove the entire miasma threat from 
this world.

-------------------
b. Basics [FFCC3B]
-------------------
Button Configuration:
There are two different types of button configuration, one for the Gamecube 
controller, and one for the Game Boy Advance.

For the controller:
Control Stick/Control Pad: Moves the character, targeting ring, the 
caravan on the world map or the cursor in menus
Start/Pause: Pause/Resume the game, skip cut scenes
A: Confirm your selection, action button, talk and examine things in towns
B: Cancel your selection, carry items, drop items, pick up items, throw 
items, open treasure chests, talk and examine in dungeons
Y: Open up the main menu
X: Order Mog to carry or drop the crystal chalice, bring Mog close.
L/R: Cycle through commands and menus

For the Gameboy Advance:
Control Pad: Moves the character, targeting ring, the caravan on the world 
map or the cursor in menus
Start: Pause/Resume the game, skip cut scenes
Select: Switch controls between the Gamecube and the Gameboy
A: Confirm your selection, action button, talk and examine things in towns
B: Cancel your selection, carry items, drop items, pick up items, throw 
items, open treasure chests, talk and examine in dungeons
L/R: Cycle through commands and menus

The World Map:
There is no hub world in Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles. You will have 
to move your caravan icon around the world map. To enter an area, press 
A there. Dungeons are indicated by the icon of a myrrh tree in their icon. 
If the myrrh tree is green, then myrrh is available there. If it has wilted, 
then it means that you cannot collect myrrh from there for the time being. 
You may encounter special events in all the junctions, so be aware.

Transferring Characters:
Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles is like Pokemon in this respect. You 
can transfer a character from another Memory Card to the one you are having 
now. Just select Bring a Friend on the menu, and then select Transfer 
Character. You can then select the character from the other Memory Card 
you would like to transfer into yours. Transferred Characters can never 
ever receive letters. You can also delete characters using the Bring a 
Friend Feature. Just select Delete Character and select the character you 
would like to remove. (Good for people who are not satisfied with the 
character he/she has newly created.)

Miasma Streams:
Miasma Streams link different parts of the world together. Each miasma 
stream has its own element. They can be Fire (Red), Water (Blue), Earth 
(Yellow) or Wind (Green). To get past a miasma stream, you must have your 
crystal chalice have the same element of the stream. Otherwise, the miasma 
stream will repel you back, preventing you from passing. The elements of 
the miasma streams change every year, so pay attention to the world map 
at the beginning of each year, or ask the wife of the village elder, and 
she will show you the distribution.

Mog the Moogle:
If you play a single player game, you will get a moogle called Mog to carry 
the Crystal Chalice around for you. You can also find moogle houses hidden 
in towns or dungeons everywhere. Inside, you will get to have your card 
stamped by the resident moogle there. If you have a set of matching stamps, 
then you get to play the blazing caravans minigame on your Gameboy Advance. 
On the other hand, you can paint Mog's fur inside the Moogle house. Paint 
him red for an enemy radar on the GBA, paint him green for a scouter, and 
blue for a treasure radar. You can also trim his fur, making him cooler 
in hot dungeons like Lynari Desert.

The Crystal's Aura:
As you can see, there is a colored circle surrounding the Crystal Chalice. 
That is the crystal's aura. As long as you stay inside the circle, you 
can slowly regain health. However, if you wander outside the circle, you 
will have direct contact with the miasma, and hence, you will start to 
lose health. To help resist miasma, wear a crystal ring.

Gameboy Advance Connectivity:
If you do plug in a GBA in the player two controller socket via a link 
cable to the GCN while you are playing single player, you can get to see 
the world map, as well as the bonus objective of the dungeon. The bonus 
objective is important as the more points you get the better the choices 
of the artifacts you get to choose in the end of the level.

If you would like to paint Mog, I suggest you only paint him green, then 
you can get to learn of the enemies' weaknesses and their current HP, so 
you will know exactly when they will be dead.

Artifacts:
In an action RPG like Final Fantasy: Crystals Chronicles, you are to kill 
monsters and enemies freely. Therefore, it makes experience points rather 
useless in this game. Therefore, they have specially designed artifacts 
for your characters to grow stronger. Artifacts can boost your Strength, 
Defense, Magic and can increase the number of command slots, as well as 
the number of hearts your characters have. You can also collect special 
rings of Magicite that allow you to cast magic any time.

Food:
You get to collect different kinds of Food items in the game. Eating food 
replenishes your health, however, different characters have different 
preferences to food, and that can be checked by selecting Favorites in 
the menu. Your preferences will change as you eat the same type of food 
again and again.

-------------------------
c. Bonus Points [FFCC3C]
-------------------------
Whenever you beat a dungeon, you will get to see your bonus points, and 
what objective you were meant to fulfill. The more you fulfill an objective, 
the more points you get. Here are the objectives:

Pick up items:
Whenever you defeat enemies or open treasure chests, items will appear 
them. Pick up as many items you can find to gain more points. You cannot 
gain points if you pick up an item dropped by a friend.

Pick up money:
This is by the same logic as pick up items. Whenever you find gold coins 
on the ground, pick them up, they are gil. The more coins you pick up, 
the more points you get. However, not points are awarded if you pick up 
money dropped by your friends.

Defeat Enemies with Focus Attacks:
The more enemies you defeat with Focus Attacks, the more points you are 
getting. Note that it is the final hit that really counts. Therefore, use 
a scouter to keep track of the enemies' HP, and when it is almost zero, 
make your strike.

Defeat Enemies with Spells:
The more enemies you defeat with spells, no matter whether they are fused, 
the more points you are getting. Note that it is the final hit that really 
counts. Therefore, use a scouter to keep track of the enemies' HP, and 
when it is almost zero, make your strike.

Defeat Enemies with Spell Fusion:
The more enemies you defeat with fused spells like Fira or Blizzara, the 
more points you are getting. Note that it is the final hit that really 
counts. Therefore, use a scouter to keep track of the enemies' HP, and 
when it is almost zero, make your strike. This is not very hard, as many 
fused spells do area damage on a couple of enemies at once.

Open Treasure Chests:
The more treasure chests you open in a level, the more points you get.

Inflict Damage:
The more times you score hits on enemies, the more points you receive. 
Note that they are counting the hits, not counting the kills. Therefore, 
the more enemies in the level and the weaker the weapon you equip, the 
easier it is to score points.

Take Physical Damage: The more times you get hit with physical attacks 
like swords, the more points you receive. This is easy if you have a magicite 
of cure in hand.

Take Magical Damage: The more times you get hit with spells, the more points 
you receive. This is easy if there are mages in the level, and you have 
a magicite of cure in hand.

Avoid Damage: You start with a set number of points, that decreases as 
you take hits from enemies.

Don't Cast Spells: You start with a set number of points, that decreases 
as you cast spells.

Don't use Focus Attacks: You start with a set number of points, that 
decreases as you use focus attacks.

Don't use physical attacks: You start with a set number of points, that 
decreases as you use the attack command.

Don't heal yourself: You start with a set number of points, that decreases 
as you use cure to heal yourself or use food of any kind.

Don't pick anything up: You start with a set number of points, that 
decreases as you pick items or money up.

---------------
Bonus Points
---------------
This section is for those who are interested in predetermining their bonus 
points for a level even before the item selection screen shows up after 
you defeat the boss. For the bonuses that require you to do something, 
you start at zero and gain points at the specified increment for every 
required action taken. For bonuses that require you not to do something, 
you start at 100 points, and lose points at the decrements listed below 
for every prohibited action you have made.

The final formula for the bonus point is the sum of the points you gained, 
the number of enemies defeated and the number of items picked up. Now you 
know why it is harder to gain points for restrictions than performances.

d. Spells and Status Ailments [FFCC3D]
---------------------------------------
As it is an action RPG, the designers of Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles 
have removed the MP systems of the games. IT is much easier to cast spells 
here, as all you will need to do is to collect Magicite of various spells 
in the game. There are 6 types of magicite in Final Fantasy: Crystal 
Chronicles. All spells are given out the same way as focused attacks. Make 
sure you have the right spell in use as displayed on screen, and you are 
off.

Fire:
This Red Magicite gets you to blast enemies with a burst of fire, which 
can burn them, lowering their defense. 

If an enemy is attempting to use fire on you, you should find an orange 
red burning targeting ring on the ground.

Thunder:
This Indigo Magicite allows your characters to shock the enemies with a 
small electric jolt, that can render them into shock, being unable to move 
for a short time.

If an enemy is attempting to use Thunder on you, you should see a targeting 
ring with electrical jolts on it.

Blizzard:
This Blue Magicite allows you to fire a shot of ice at the enemy, freezing 
it in. If you hit them while they are frozen, that attack will deal twice 
as much damage as it normally does.

If an enemy is attempting to use Blizzard on you, you should find a light 
blue targeting ring on the ground.

Cure:
This Green Magicite allows you to heal yourself and any friendlies nearby 
to full strength.

Clear:
This White Magicite allows you to rid yourself and any friendlies nearby 
of any status ailments they are having.

Life:
This Yellow Magicite allows you to revive any fallen party members. This 
is not entirely useless in single player, as it can be fused with other 
spells to make other useful things.

---------------
Fusing Spells
---------------
As I said, you can fuse spells to make more powerful ones. To fuse spells, 
go to the command list, and arrange two or three of your spells together 
so that they are next to each other. Then the spells will automatically 
be fused, otherwise, you can manually fuse the spells by selecting the 
magicite and selecting Fuse. Note that Slow and Holy are two spells that 
are dependent on the arrangement of the two adjoining magicites.

In multiplayer games, you fuse spells by having two players overlap their 
targeting rings, and releasing them together. (Within one thirds to two 
thirds of a second the first player releases his button)

Gravity: (Fire/Thunder/Blizzard + Fire/Thunder/Blizzard)
If you fuse any two different magicite above together, you can get to use 
the Gravity Spell. Whenever you find flying enemies, you will find them 
to be taking only 1 HP of damage per hit regardless of how hard you hit 
them. To make them more vulnerable, perform the Gravity Spell on them and 
they can be dragged onto the ground. Therefore, they will be helpless as 
they sit on the ground, allowing you to hit them until they die. Besides, 
there are just some enemies that are made of stone, like Stone Hedgehogs, 
Stone Sahagins or Stone Scorpions, those cannot be damaged by normal spells, 
but they are vulnerable to gravity in the respect that one spell can take 
half their total HP off them.

Slow: (Life + Fire/Thunder/Blizzard)
This spell slows the enemies down, rendering them less agile than before. 
This is not a very significant spell, no, not at all.

If an enemy is attempting to use Slow on your character, you should see 
a blue targeting ring on the ground with some 0s and 1s spinning inside.

Slowga: (3 players, Life + Fire/Thunder/Blizzard + Fire/Thunder/Blizzard)
This is one slow move that can appeal to the masses. This move has a wider 
radius than slow, and can slow down more enemies at once that way. To perform 
this spell, When Player 1 has cast Life, Players 2 and 3 must cast their 
respective spells between 1/3 to 2/3 of a second after Player 1 has released 
his A button. Then watch as the masses all slow down!

If an enemy is attempting to use Slowga on your character, you should see 
a blue targeting ring on the ground with some 0s and 1s spinning inside.

Holy: (Fire/Thunder/Blizzard + Life)
Sometimes, you will face enemies that are invisible, like Ghosts and Dark 
Hedgehogs. If you attempt to attack them by any physical means, you can 
only deal one HP damage per hit. This is not the way to deal with things 
eh? This is what holy is for. Once you use Holy on an invisible enemy, 
not only they will be damaged, they will also become visible and solid, 
hence they will not be much more vulnerable to your physical attacks than 
ever before. This move also deals a considerable damage to other enemies 
too. Some bosses are just invisible, and this is just the spell you need 
to help defeat them.

Holyra: (3 Players, Fire/Thunder/Blizzard + Life + Life)
This is yet another enhanced version of Holy. It has a larger area effect 
than holy alone. To cast this spell in multiplayer, player 1 must cast 
Holy, then Players 2 and 3 must cast Life between 1/3 to 2/3 seconds after 
Player 1 has released the A button. Then watch and be amazed as all the 
demons become visible once more!

Fira: (Fire + Fire)
If you fuse two Fire Magicites together, you get to use an enhanced version 
of Fire. This move will send a wider fiery blast at your enemies, and a 
ring of fire will spin around the central blast zone, and it is capable 
of dealing multiple hits on the enemy.

If an enemy is attempting to use Fira on you, you should find an orange 
red burning targeting ring on the ground.

Firaga: (Fire + Fire + Fire)
This is the ultimate Fire spell. If you fuse three Fire Magicites together, 
you get to use the strongest version of Fire. This move has a long charge 
time, but is still worthwhile to use. Once released, we get to see a very 
large pulse of fire swelling up, and then, a large firestorm will engulf 
all the enemies unlucky enough to be in the blast zone.

If an enemy is attempting to use Firaga on you, you should find an orange 
red burning targeting ring on the ground.

Thundara: (Thunder + Thunder)
If you fuse two Thunder Magicites together, you get to use an enhanced 
version of Thunder. This move will send a wider electric blast at your 
enemies, and a ring of lightning will spin around the central blast zone, 
and it is capable of dealing multiple hits on the enemy.

If an enemy is attempting to use Thundara on you, you should see a targeting 
ring with electrical jolts on it.

Thundaga: (Thunder + Thunder + Thunder)
This is the ultimate Thunder spell. If you fuse three Thunder Magicites 
together, you get to use the strongest version of Thunder. This move has 
a long charge time, but is still worthwhile to use. Once released, we get 
to see a very large ball of electricity charging up, and then a very large 
electromagnetic pulse will be let out, giving anyone caught within its 
radius a serious electric shock.

If an enemy is attempting to use Thundaga on you, you should see a targeting 
ring with electrical jolts on it.

Blizzara: (Blizzard + Blizzard)
If you fuse two Blizzard Magicites together, you get to use an enhanced 
version of Blizzard. This move will send a wider blast of ice at your enemies, 
and a ring of two icicles will spin around the central blast zone, and 
it is capable of dealing multiple hits on the enemy, freezing them all 
in at once.

If an enemy is attempting to use Blizzara on you, you should find a light 
blue targeting ring on the ground.

Blizzaga: (Blizzard + Blizzard + Blizzard)
This is the ultimate Blizzard spell. If you fuse three Blizzard Magicites 
together, you get to use the strongest version of Blizzard. This move has 
a long charge time, but is still worthwhile to use. Once released, we get 
to see a very large snow flake like thing swelling out, and then a very 
large cold blast coupled with a crashing sound will be released, freezing 
a very large group of enemies at once. Lovely. This has got to be my favorite 
spell of all times. Tee hee hee...

If an enemy is attempting to use Blizzaga on you, you should find a light 
blue targeting ring on the ground.

Curaga: (2 players, Cure + Cure):
Once, I was playing as very tough Boss Fight with my friend, and we were 
both getting bashed hard. Therefore, I asked my friend to cure himself. 
I myself used cure, and by some coincidence, our target rings overlapped, 
and then a very large healing wave came out, healing both of us to full 
strength at once. This is how Curaga works. This may not be worthwhile 
in the dungeons, but however, when used in bossed fights, it can certainly 
be a big life saver to all of you out there.

Clearaga: (2 Players, Clear + Clear)
So, are both of you feeling down? Do both of you feel ill, then no fear, 
Clearaga is here! To cast Clearaga, have two players perform clear at once, 
and let the two target rings overlap. Then watch and smile as all of you 
get sweet, sweet, relief.

Full Life: (2 Players, Life + Life)
Normally, only 4 hearts can be restored when you use life, but when 2 players 
overlap their Life target rings, an even more powerful version of Life 
will be available. This trick can fully restore a fallen character's health 
while bring him back to life.

Haste: (Life + Cure + Cure)
This has got to be one obscure spell. After all, who would have thought 
of aligning Life and 2 Cures in a roll? Anyway, by trial and error, I 
discovered this neat move. Once executed on yourself or a friend, the 
affected player will have a positive status change called Haste. This 
allows them to move and attack much faster than before!

Hastaga: (4 players, Life + Cure + Cure + Cure)
This is the wide ranged version of Haste. This has got to be one of the 
most complex moves in Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles as 4 players are 
needed, while Player 1 is casting Life, Players 2,3 and 4 must overlap 
their targeting rings with Player 1's and release the A button 1/3 to 2/3 
seconds after Player 1. Then enjoy the ride as you all go insanely fast!

Stop: (Life + Fire/Thunder/Blizzard + Fire/Thunder/Blizzard)
This is yet another effective fused spell. IF you fuse Life, one of 
Fire/Thunder/Blizzard with another different magicite of the three, you 
get to use the Stop spell. This stops the enemy, rendering them into a 
paralysis. When in paralysis, the affected enemy cannot move for a longer 
time than when frozen or in shock. This is particularly effective against 
those stronger enemies, and once stopping them. Feel free to beat the life 
out of them.

If an enemy is attempting to use Stop on your character, you should see 
a yellow targeting ring on the ground with some 0s and 1s spinning inside.

----------------
Status Ailments
----------------
Final Fantasy is a complex game, and therefore, it offers 10 different 
status ailments for your character to suffer from. Here they are.

Burning:
If someone performs a Fire Spell or any other fire related moves on you, 
you will get burnt. When you are burning, you get set on fire, and your 
defense will be weakened by 25%, making yourself more vulnerable. To 
protect your self against Burning, have your Crystal Chalice have the Fire 
Element, or wear Flame Armor, or have a Flame Badge equipped.

Shock:
If your character has been hit by electricity, then they will suffer from 
an electric shock, and will not be able to move for a short time. You should 
also be careful when facing enemies that are made of electricity themselves, 
like Electric Jellyfish or Electric Scorpions. These enemies, if hit with 
physical attacks will give you an electric shock. To protect yourself from 
shock, change your crystal chalice's element to Wind, or wear lightning 
armor or equip a lightning badge.

Freezing:
If your character has been hit by any icy moves, then you will be frozen 
solid, and cannot move. What's more, if an enemy hits you while you are 
frozen, you will receive twice the damage as normal. Therefore watch out. 
To prevent yourself from being frozen, change your crystal chalice's 
element to water, or wear frost armor or equip a frost badge.

Slowness:
If an enemy hits you with Slow, or any other slowing moves, you will be 
temporarily slowed down. You cannot run at all, and your focus attacks 
and spells taking longer to charge up. To prevent yourself from being slowed 
down, equip yourself with time armor, or simply wear an accurate watch.

Haste:
This has got to be the one and only positive status on your character. 
When affected, you move much faster than before. Simply cast Haste on 
yourself to speed up. It lasts for quite a long time too.

Paralysis:
Some enemies can cast stop on you too. If that happens, all the time will 
stop around you, rendering you immobile, with a gold ring above your head. 
There is nothing you can do but to let it wear off. To prevent yourself 
from being paralyzed, equip eternal armor, or equip an unfaltering watch.

Curse:
If some enemy manages to curse you (Look out for their purple targeting 
rings), you will be cursed, and all of your stats will be cut in half, 
rendering yourself extremely vulnerable. Therefore, use Clear on yourself 
and fast! TO protect against curses, have your character equip a 
saintly(holy) armor, or wear a white misanga.

Poison:
If you are poisoned, your hearts appear purple, and you will lose half 
a heart for a while until you cure yourself. It is best to use clear on 
yourself instead of waiting. Most moves that can poison you involve 
spraying green gas on you. To prevent yourself from being poisoned, have 
your character equip blessed (pure) armor, change the element of the 
crystal chalice to Earth, or wear a Blue Misanga.

Petrification:
You may sometimes turn to stone. Then, you will not be able to move. However, 
this may not be a bad thing, as your defense will increase to 99 while 
you are petrified, so surrounding enemies may not be able to hurt you that 
much. However, to avoid turning into stone, set the element of your crystal 
chalice to earth, where armor made of gold, or wear a gold necklace.

Death:
IF your HP falls to zero, you are dead. Press the A button to wave to your 
friends, if any so they may come and bring you back to life.

------------------------------
e. Tribes and Trades [FFCC3E]
------------------------------
There are a total of 4 tribes in Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles for 
you to choose from. You can create a male character or female character, 
and each sex has 4 different appearances, making up to 32 possibilities 
in the game. Each tribe has its own attributes, as shown below.

---------------
The 4 Tribes
---------------
Clavats:
Base Stats: Strength: 6   Defense: 7   Magic: 13

The Clavats are a peace loving people who are the most human-like in the 
entire Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles. They have the most all rounded 
stats in the game, although they specialize in defense. This is because, 
they are the only tribe that can make use of the Gaia Plate (Earth Armor) 
and the Legendary Shield (Chocobo Shield). They are my personal favorite, 
and one of my 2 main characters are of this tribe. When raising the Clavats, 
make sure you put all 3 stats in equal priority.

Lilties:
Base Stats: Strength: 8   Defense: 8   Magic: 10

The Lilties are a race of tiny hot headed people who used to rule the world. 
And of course, many of them still have a superiority complex in them. Oh, 
another thing, these guys just have the funniest heads in the game. IN 
fact, they are nothing but, APPLE HEADS! Ha ha ha ha! I know I love to 
laugh at these funny looking guys, but they are not to be underestimated 
when physical combat is concerned. In fact, they are the only tribe to 
be able to use a weapon with 40 strength, the Longinus, which is made using 
the Celestial Weapon scroll. Woo hoo... When raising a Lilty, you should 
concentrate on raising their strength and defense.

Yukes:
Base Stats: Strength: 5   Defense: 5   Magic: 15

The Yukes are of a race that is probably the wisest of them all. They like 
to spend their day teaching magic to others, and many of them live in Shella. 
(The Shella Caravan is led by Amidatty, and has 3 other Yukes with him) 
But still, for some strange reason, all Yukes tend to look like as if they 
are wearing helmets that they never remove, and that really is something 
very silly. Yes, this is yet another thing that I love to laugh at. However, 
what is not to laugh at is their magic. In fact, they are the fastest spell 
casters in this game. Therefore you should focus on their defense and magic 
when you are raising them.

Selkies:
Base Stast: Strength: 7   Defense: 6   Magic: 12

The manual says that the Selkies are rugged individualists that place their 
interests above all else. Yes, it is just true, in fact a lot of Selkies 
used to be thieves, including the Striped Brigands, who will stop by to 
steal an item from your caravan every now and then. Of course, all thieves 
have to be fast on their feet, and hence many Selkies are the fastest of 
all the 4 tribes. Lovely, isn't it. In fact, they taunt the fastest Focus 
Attack Charge Time, and many of their physical weapons have focus attacks 
that are ballistic in nature. Just look at their Dreamcatcher (Lunar 
Weapon)! When raising Selkies, make sure you raise them evenly as in Clavats. 
Then you will be fine. A Selkie constitutes the other main character I 
use. For your information.

---------------------------------
A Short Comparison of the Tribes
---------------------------------
This comparison is focused on the aspect of how all rounded each tribe 
is. This is not important in multiplayer games where you can have 1 tribe 
per player, so each tribe's strengths outweighs their shortcomings. 
However, in single player games, you only get to have 1 character, which 
means you can only use 1 tribe at once. In such a predicament, it is important 
that your tribe has to be as all arounded as possible, so that they are 
fit to deal with all threats at once. I will use a scoring system. When 
a tribe is 1st in a property, it will be given 3 points, if it is 2nd, it 
gets 2 points, if it is 3rd it gets 1 point and if it is last, it gets 
no points.

The Clavats are 3rd in strength, although they are 2nd in base stat of defense, 
they do have 2 unique and powerful pieces of armor that makes their maximum 
defense higher than that of the Lilties. Therefore they are first in defense. 
As for magic, they are second best,and they do have their fair share of 
magic accessories. Therefore, Clavats get 1 + 3 + 2 = 6 points.

The Lilties are no doubt, strongest in strength as they have the Longinus, 
and are 2nd in defense. However, their lackluster performance in Magic 
is a big problem here. Therefore, Lilty players should focus on raising 
their charcter's Strength and Defense. (Their accessories are mostly for 
improving their focus attack power and range.) Lilties get 3 + 2 + 0 = 
5 points.

The Yukes in the other hand, are the worst in both Strength and Defense. 
However, they are the strongest in Magic. Most of their accessories are 
to improve their magic powers. This is just a big problem of 
overspecialization around here. But anyway, you should consider focusing 
on raising the Yuke's Defense and Magic to get the best out of them. In 
multiplayer games, make sure your Yuke is supported by another tribe. Yukes 
get 0 + 0 + 3 = 3 points.

The Selkies are the fastest race, and this is a good supplement to their 
second best Strength, as you can use Focus Attacks quicker and use 
accessories to speed up. Their defense is weaker than that of Lilties, 
and stronger than that of Yukes. As for their magic, they are slightly 
behind the Clavats. But substantially stronger than the Lilties. When 
raising these charcters, you should raise them evenly as in the case of 
Clavats. Selkies get 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 points.

Conclusion: 
The Clavats are the most all rounded, while the Yukes are the most 
specialized. Your choosing of the tribes is solely dependent of your 
playing style. Yet it does not hurt to have 2 members of each tribe in 
your party, although I have 3 Clavats, 1 Lilty, 2 Yukes and 2 Selkies in 
my party. (I have created a new Yuke by the name of Anton M, but he is 
not being raised yet.)

---------------
Family Trades
---------------
You can create up to 8 characters in the game. Each character has their 
own family, which lives by their own trade. Of course, to fit in with this 
atmosphere, the village of Tipa has room for 8 different trades, namely 
the Blacksmith, Tailor, Farmer, Rancher, Miller, Fisherman, Merchant and 
Alchemists.

It is vital that your character can maintain a good relationship with their 
families. This is because, having good relationships with your family can 
result in discounts in prices for you and your other party members, and 
increase their production capabilities. 

To improve relationships, send gifts home in the mail, send back money 
when your mother is ill, and so on, then they will all be happy, and you 
will have pink smiley faces on the family page.

When the father of the family has a green neutral expression, you can get 
a 10% discount on any services or goods provided. If he has an orange smiling 
expression, then you will receive a 20% discount. When he is super happy 
with a pink expression, you will receive a 30% discount!

The son/daughter of the tradesman will receive further discounts. There 
was this instance here my character's father was having the orange happy 
expression, and when I talked to him, he offered to forge the Legendary 
Weapon for only 1175 gil, where in normal cases, you will be charged 2500! 
This is a 53% discount!

Now, let me introduce the families one by one. For some strange reason, 
it's the man of the family that's the tradesman, although I thought female 
tailors would be more reasonable.

Blacksmith:
The Blacksmith is one of the most important tradesman in the game. He crafts 
weapons and armor for you and your friends, and does it for a reduced price 
if you have a good relationship with your father. There are 3 other 
blacksmiths in this world, and 2 of them are found in Marr's Pass, 1 crafts 
weapons, the other crafts conventional armor. The 3rd is found in Alfataria, 
and he specializes in crafting special protective armor, like those that 
help you resist fire and so on. If you can improve your relationships with 
him, more and more stuff can be crafted for your use.

At first, the Blacksmith can forge things with bronze and iron, like  Bronze 
Armor, Iron Armor, Bronze Gloves, Iron Gloves, Bronze Belt, Iron Belt, 
Iron Shield, Warrior's Weapon, and Novice's Weapon. Later he can craft 
things with Mythril, like the Master's Weapon, Mythril Sallet, Mythril 
Gloves, Mythril Belt, and Mythril Shield. When your relationships continue 
to rise, your father can craft things with Orrichalum and Diamond Ore to 
forge the Legendary Weapon, Diamond Gloves, Diamond Sallet, Diamond Armor, 
Diamond Shield, and the Diamond Belt. Finally he can craft the greatest 
weapon when you get along well enough. If there is anything that you cannot 
carve, find the respective blacksmith.

Tailor:
The Tailor is the man's job in this game, and is just as important as the 
Blacksmith. The Tailor also crafts things, but they craft accessories, 
which can also be equipped to protect your character against some things, 
or to enhance your character's abilities. There is only one Tailor in the 
whole world in Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles (That's a laugh). He is 
called Spiran, and he lives in Shella, which is very far away, in Veo Lu. 
If you do not want to bother with wasting all the time traveling to Veo 
Lu and finding a Shella Mark and so on, I'd suggest you have a tailor working 
in Tipa, otherwise, it's just plain annoying.

As in the case of the Blacksmith, having good relations with the father 
can help improve his craftsmanship and he can make more and more complex 
items for you and your friends. At first, your father can craft you a Flame 
Badge, Frost Badge, Lightning Badge and the Accurate Watch, then he can 
craft the Unfaltering Watch, Blue Misanga, Wisdom Charm, Speed Charm, 
Daeon's Earring, Pixie's Earring, Twisted Spectacles and the Power Goggles. 
Then he can make the White Misanga, Gold Necklace, Wisdom Talisman, Speed 
Talisman, Devil's Earring, Angel's Earring, Twisted Scope and Eagle 
Goggles. Finally, when you get along well enough, he can craft the Force 
Ring. Otherwise, just go and find Mr. Spiran and he will see to it.

Farmer:
The Farmer resides in his farm, marked by the big sign saying welcome to 
the Fields of Tipa. The farmers in Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles grow 
wheat, which they will pass on to the millers to grind into flour. That's 
it. Send home wheat seeds, and they will give you bread, two years later, 
you will start to get wheat.

Rancher:
This tradesman resides in a house by the entrance to the village, with 
a hill behind the house to raise cattle. The better the relationship with 
your parent, the more meat you are going to get. On the other hand, if 
you send a cow home from the Fields of Fum, you will start getting milk.

Miller:
The Miller works at his mill to the left of the entrance of Tipa. He is 
a lot like the farmer, but he will send you flour after year two.

Fisherman:
Well, a fisherman catches fish. He lives in a house beyond the millers' 
adjoining a river. The better the relationship with your father, the more 
fish he will save for you.

Merchant:
This is yet another important tradesman of Final Fantasy: Crystal 
Chronicles. As you can see, there are many merchants around the world, 
selling different stuff, ranging from food to materials, to plans for 
weapons. There is also a traveling merchant that appears in Alfataria and 
the Fields of Fum alternately between years. He sells important material, 
but the lack of a fixed location can prove inconvenient. Like the Tailor 
and Blacksmith, you can slowly broaden your choices if you can improve 
your relationship with your parent. Eventually your parent would sell all 
the mainstream items in the game.

At first, he will only sell Bronze, Iron, Alloy, Fish, Meat, Iron and Spring 
Water. Then, he will start selling Mythril, Gold, Silver, Bronze Shards 
and Iron Shards. Next, he will sell Magma Rocks, Chilly Gel and Thunderballs. 
Finally, he will sell Ultimite and Dark Spheres. Make sure you have good 
enough relationships with your parent, otherwise, you cannot enjoy any 
discounts.

Alchemist:
No, this is not a tradesman who will turn metal into gold and give it to 
you, but he will do research on the materials you send him, and will give 
you various designs for weapons and accessories like the Ring of 
Invincibility and the Greatest Weapon. That is the only way you can get 
those designs. So improve your relationship with your father. This is what 
he can make for you each year. Starting from year 2.

Level 1 - Iron Armor
Level 2 - Warrior's Weapon
Level 3 - Flame Armor
Level 4 - Clockwork
Level 5 - Mythril Armor
Level 6 - Frost Armor
Level 7 - Lightning Craft
Level 8 - Master's Weapon
Level 9 - Ring Of Light
Level 10 - Diamond Armor
Level 11 - Ring Of Invincibility
Level 12 - Greatest Weapon

Don't gripe even if you have forgotten to get the Greatest Weapon, because 
it may not be a bad thing even if you do not. After all, many tribes have 
other weapons that match the strength of their Greatest Weapon. After all, 
it's not practical to forge one of those as it costs 50000 gil if there 
is no discount.

----------------------
f. Artifacts [FFCC3F]
----------------------
Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles has a system of leveling up that is unique 
to all the other Final Fantasies. (At least that is Square-Enix's tradition) 
To level up, killing enemies endlessly is NEVER the solution. Instead, 
you only get to level up once in the end of a level, after you have beaten 
the boss. The artifacts you get is dependent on how many bonus points your 
character gets during the game. If you are playing a multiplayer game, 
with 2 to 4 players, the character with the highest number of bonus points 
gets the first choice. There are in total of 6 types of artifacts you can 
find. They are Strength Boosting Artifacts, Defense Boosting Artifacts, 
Magic Boosting Artifacts, Command Slot Artifacts, Heart Artifacts and 
Magicite Rings. Now, let me introduce each type of artifact to you, one 
by one. Each level now will have its own Artifact List, so you will know 
which levels you can find a certain artifact. (Note: The Score requirements 
for each level are rounded up to the nearest 10.)

----------------------------
Strength Boosting Artifacts
----------------------------
Simply put, choosing these artifacts will allow your character's Strength 
to be permanently increased between 1 to 5 units. There is a considerable 
number of such artifacts in this game, as each character can only have 
one weapon to boost his/her Strength.

Artifacts that boost your Strength by 1 include:
Ashura, Double Axe, Fang Charm, Green Beret, Kaiser Knuckles, Maneater, 
Onion Sword, Power Wristband and Shuriken.

Artifacts that boost your Strength by 2 include:
Engetsurin, Flametongue, Ice Brand, Loaded Dice, Ogre Killer and Twisted 
Headband.

Artifacts that boost your Strength by 3 include:
Giant's Glove, Heavy Armband, Masquerade, Mjollnir and Sasuke's Blade.

Artifacts that boost your Strength by 4 include:
Murasame.

Artifacts that boost your Strength by 5 include:
Gekkabijin and Masamune.

In total, your character can gain 50 Strength by gathering Strength 
Boosting Artifacts alone.

---------------------------
Defense Boosting Artifacts
---------------------------
If you choose a Defense Boosting Artifact in the Item Selection Screen, 
then your character's Defense will be permanently increased by a number 
between 1 and 5. There are fewer Defense Boosting Artifacts than Strength 
Boosting Artifacts, mainly because each character can equip him/herself 
with 2 Defensive Items.

Artifacts that boost your Defense by 1 include:
Buckler, Drill, Silver Spectacle, Sparkling Bracer.

Artifacts that boost your Defense by 2 include:
Arai Helm, Black Hood, Elven Mantle, Main Gauche, Rat's Tail and Teddy 
Bear.

Artifacts that boost your Defense by 3 include:
Chicken Knife and Wonder Bangle.

Artifacts that boost your Defense by 4 include:
Protection Ring and Save Queen.

Artifacts that boost your Defense by 5 include:
Aegis.

In total, your character can gain 35 Defense by collecting Defense Boosting 
Artifacts alone.

-------------------------
Magic Boosting Artifacts
-------------------------
You know the drill, if your character chooses a Magic Boosting Artifact 
from the Item Selection Screen, your character's Magic will be increased 
by a number between 1 and 10! This is mainly because, there are no items 
that can increase your Magic by equipping them. For the same reason, the 
Magic Boosting Artifacts make up the majority of all the Artifacts you 
will find in the game.

Artifacts that boost your Magic by 1 include:
Book of Light, Candy Ring, Cat's Bell, Dragon's Whisker, Faerie Ring, Mage 
Masher, Rune Staff, Silver Bracer and Winged Cap.

Artifacts that boost your Magic by 3 include:
Kris, Red Slippers, Rune Bell, Sage's Staff and Wonder Wand.

Artifacts that boost your Magic by 5 include:
Dark Matter, Gold Hairpin, Mage's Staff and Noah's Lute.

Artifacts that boost your Magic by 7 or above include:
Galatyn (+7), Taotie Motif (+7), Ribbon (+9) and Ultima Tome (+10).

In total, your character can gain 77 Magic by collecting Magic Boosting 
Artifacts alone.

----------------------
Command Slot Artifacts 
----------------------
Initially, your character would have only 4 Command Slots, but with the 
help of Command Slot Artifacts, more Command Slots can be gained, resulting 
in your character having up to 8 Command Slots. The 4 Artifacts are all 
pockets, and they are Moogle Pocket, Chocobo Pocket, Gobbie Pocket and 
Ultimate Pocket.

----------------
Heart Artifacts 
----------------
All chracters start with 4 hearts, and will prove to have a heart time 
against bosses with powerful attacks. The Heart Artifacts are here to fix 
that. With their help, more hearts can be gained, resulting in your 
character having up to 8 hearts. The 4 Artifacts are all Pendants, and 
they are Earth Pendant, Moon Pendant, Star Pendant and Sun Pendant.

---------------
Magicite Rings
---------------
Having the need to cast a spell anywhere, and there are no stones of Magicite 
for that spell? Fear not, the Magicite Rings are here. The Magicite Rings 
allow your character to cast spells at any time. Each ring also adds 1 
to your character's Magic Stat, which makes it worthwhile to collect them 
even if you may think they are not needed. The 5 Rings include the Blizzard 
Ring, Fire Ring, Thunder Ring, Cure Ring and Life Ring. Sorry, but there 
is no Clear Ring. Tough luck.

In total, your character can gain 5 Magic by collecting Magicite Rings 
alone.

--------------------
Artifact Checklist
--------------------
I know, with so many artifacts, it may be hard to keep track of which ones 
you have. Selecting Artifacts on the menu just won't help, as those which 
are not collected will not be listed. Here, I will list out all the Artifacts 
found in the game, and feel free to print it out. I recommend you to copy 
this to Wordpad or Microsoft Word before printing it out. Whenever you 
have collected an artifact, just tick the box next to the corresponding 
artifact.

g. Crafting and Materials [FFCC3G]
-----------------------------------
Unlike most RPGs, weapons and accessories in Final Fantasy: Crystal 
Chronicles are not just bought from the shops from say RPGs like Earthbound 
or Pokemon. To acquire a new piece of equipment you must first find the 
design for it, then gather the required materials. Then, you should visit 
a Blacksmith or Tailor who has the ability to forge or craft the item. 
Then pay and you can have it. 

As I said, there are two types of Craftsmen in this game. They are the 
Blacksmith and Tailor. A Blacksmith can forge weapons and armor, which 
increases your character's Strength and Defense. Some pieces of armor also 
provide the character wearing it with some new and improved attributes 
like resistance to Fire. Tailors craft accessories, which can improve your 
character's attributes only. A character can equip one weapon and 2 pieces 
of armor, and 1 accessory at the same time, if they don't want to use up 
slots on the Command List. This section will provide detailed information 
to all the materials found in the game. This is like an encyclopedia here. 
If you do not want to scroll through all this, use the Search Keys provided 
in the table of contents to skip ahead. Note that all materials and items 
can be sold at a quarter of its original price. Costs with an asterisk 
(*) are items that cannot be bought anywhere, but can be sold at a quarter 
of its listed price.

*****METALLIC MATERIALS*****
Bronze
Found on: Many different enemies and merchants
Cost: 250 gil 
Can be used to make: Many, many weapons, armor and accessories
Well, Bronze is just an alloy of copper and tin, although I think the mix 
ratio between the two metals is 2:1. Bronze is quite a strong and common 
material, and it can be found in many enemies in the early cycles of easy 
stages like River Belle Path. Otherwise, you can just find merchants like 
Gi Lubeh or your village merchant to buy Bronze from them at a price of 
250 gil per chunk. These ARE NOT good selling items. Always try to find 
uses for them if you happen to pick one up.

Iron
Found on: Many different enemies and merchants
Cost: 500 gil 
Can be used to make: Many, many weapons, armor and accessories
Iron is a stronger and more durable material here in Final Fantasy: Crystal 
Chronicles, and my bet is that this Iron is actually Mild Steel. Otherwise, 
it could not have been as tough as Bronze, which is an alloy itself. Iron 
appears as silvery tetrahedral chunks in the playing field. They can be 
found in many enemies and merchants, and they can still be found on enemies 
in the third cycle of River Belle Path. Otherwise, buy it from a merchant 
for 500 gil. Again, chunks of Iron ARE NOT good selling items.

Mythril
Found on: Slightly stronger enemies and merchants
Cost: 5000 gil
Can be used to make: Master's Weapon, Mythril Armor, many types of special 
protective armor and other items
This has got to be the first made up metallic material in Final Fantasy: 
Crystal Chronicles. Mythril is actually some kind of blue coloured mythical 
metal, and it appears as blue octahedrals in the playing field. As it is 
such an expensive material, the developers of this game have the right 
mind to charge them a ludicrous 5000 gil for a single chunk. The good thing 
is that Mythril can be found in many common strong enemies like Griffins, 
Orcs or Goblin Chieftains. Therefore, if you have a run inside places like 
the Mine of Carthuiges, you may be in for a treat. Mythril is used to forge 
many medium-high end weapons and armor, such as the Master's Weapon or 
maybe Holy Armor, to name a few. Mythril is a good selling item. If you 
have excess Mythril in stock, sell them for 1250 gil a piece! That's how 
my first character got rich.

Orichalcum
Found on: Item Selection Screen, Behemoths and Zus
Cost: 18000 gil*
Can be used to make: Legendary Weapon and stronger weapons, Diamond Armor 
and stronger armor
This has got to be the ultimate metallic material, although I am starting 
to doubt whether this really is a metal, but as the Blacksmiths can play 
with them, I guess it is. Orichalcum is a material that cannot be bought 
from any merchants. Instead, it must be picked up in the field. Even so, 
they are only found on very strong enemies like Behemoths and Zus, both 
with more than 100 HP. If you do not want to bother with those monsters, 
I suggest you try finding a chunk in the Item Selection Screens right after 
you beat a level. Orichalcum appears as golden yellow coloured tetrahedrals 
in the playing field. They are very important as they can be used to craft 
high end weapons and armor. (All weapons and armor stronger than the 
Legendary Weapon and Diamond Armor require Orichalcum.) Orichalcum is also 
a good selling item. You can get a hefty 4500 gil just by selling one chunk!

Bronze Shard
Found on: Many different enemies and merchants
Cost: 100 gil
Can be used to make: Watches
I have absolutely no idea why they would include shards of Bronze even 
if they are available as a whole chunk. My guess is that Bronze Shards 
appear in smaller pieces than a single chunk of Bronze. Bronze Shards are 
rather cheap, as they only cost 100 gil, and can be found on many enemies 
as well. Bronze Shards have much fewer uses than Bronze. After all, they 
can only be used to craft watches, which are the Accurate Watch and the 
Unfaltering Watch, which protect your character against Slow and Stasis 
respectively. Therefore, if you do have those 2 watches, be ready to dump 
this straight away, as they are not good selling items.

Iron Shard
Found on: Many different enemies and merchants
Cost: 100 gil
Can be used to make: Badges
Again, Iron Shards are obviously made of Iron, only that they must have 
been processed and dug out straight from the mines. As they are often full 
of impurities, Iron Shards are a fifth of the price of chunks of Iron. 
Like the Bronze Shard to Bronze, Iron Shards have much fewer uses than 
Iron. They can only be used to craft badges, which are the Flame Badge, 
Thunder Badge and Frost Badge, which protect your charcter against Fire, 
Lightning, and Cold respectively.

Gold
Found on: Many different enemies and the Tipa Merchant
Cost: 500 gil
Can be used to make: Gold Armor, Gold Necklace, Twisted Scopes
Gold has got to be a metal that humans have been craving for since the 
dawn of man. Gold has got to be the most unreactive metal in the world. 
as there are many gold artifacts that still have not been corroded over 
the centuries. Despite its rarity in the real world, gold comes cheap in 
Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles. In fact, only 500 gil are needed to 
buy a bag from the Tipa Merchant. Of course, Gold can be used to make things 
like armor and accessories out of Gold. All of these have one thing in 
common; they protect your character against stone. As for the Twisted Scope, 
it is used to help increase the magic casting range of Clavats.

Silver
Found on: Many different enemies and the Tipa Merchant
Cost: 500 gil
Can be used to make: Various accessories
Silver is another rare and valuable metal, although it can corrode more 
easily than Gold over the years. For some strange reason, Silver is just 
as cheap as Gold in Final Fantasy: Crystal Chorincles. Silver can only 
be used to craft accessories, some include the accessories for women, which 
both require 2 bags of silver to craft, another accessory includes the 
Pixie's Earring for Lilties. Only buy Silver if you need to craft those 
accessories. Otherwise, just dump them.

*****GEMSTONES*****
Ruby
Found on: Many different enemies and Karl Linay
Cost: 200 gil
Can be used to make: Flower Bracer and Dragon's Heart
A Ruby is simply a red coloured gemstone that drives women crazy. The good 
thing is that Rubies come cheap at only 200 gil from Karl Linay the female 
merchant in Leuda. However, Rubies only have 2 uses in Final Fantasy: 
Crystal Chronicles. They can be used to craft the Flower Bracer, an 
accessory for women, and the Dragon's Heart, an accessory for Lilties.

Jade
Found on: Many different enemies and Karl Linay
Cost: 200 gil
Can be used to make: Jade Bracer, Bishop's Soul, Wizard's Soul
Jade is simply a gemstone that is comprised of Chromium (III) ions for 
its green colour. It is known to drive ladies, particularly Orientals crazy, 
and is thought to preserve dead bodies in ancient China. Now, back to the 
game. Jade is cheap here, just buy a piece from Karl Linay for 200 gil 
as well. Jade is particularly useful to women and Yukes, as it can be used 
to craft the Jade Bracer, which offers faster HP regeneration in women, 
as well as the Bishop's Soul and Wizard's Soul, 2 accessories that improve 
the Yukes' magic power.

Diamond Ore
Found on: Slightly stronger enemies in the game
Cost: 3000 gil*
Can be used to make: Diamond Armor
You know what they say, "Diamonds are Forever", at least that's the name 
of the last Bond Movie with Sean Connery starring as James Bond. Of course, 
there is a reason why "Diamonds are Forever". After all, Diamond is the 
hardest substance on Earth, and it can even be used to cut glass, among 
other things. This makes Diamond Ore a good material to make armor. Diamond 
Armor is probably the strongest armor for all tribes excluding the Clavats. 
Diamond Ore can be found early in the game, and there is a reason to keep 
it. Please note that Orichalcum has to be used in conjunction with Diamond 
Ore in order to make Diamond Armor.

Crystal Ball
Found on: Many different enemies and Karl Linay
Cost: 100
Can be used to make: Optical Instruments
No, no, Crystal Balls are not to be used to look into the future, but they 
do have decent refracting properties due to their spherical shape. That 
is why Crystal Balls can easily be carved into lenses for use in optical 
instruments. Each tribe has its own set of optical instruments, which 
either increase their spell casting range or focus attacking range. The 
Clavats have the Twisted Scope, the Lilties have the Power Goggles, the 
Yukes have the Twisted Spectacles while the Selkies have the Eagle Goggles.

Tiny Crystal
Found on: Many different enemies
Cost: 1000 gil*
Can be used to make: Crystal Mail, Crystal Ring, Zeal Headband, Healing 
Headband
Tiny Crystals most likely are small shards of the world's crystal shattered 
by the meteor that crashed into the Earth. Of course, they offer protection 
from the miasma. Therefore, Tiny Crystals can be used to make Crystal Mail 
and Crystal Rings, which can help your character resist miasma. On the 
other hand, this is a nice item to hold on if you are male, as they can 
be used to craft the two accessories for men as stated above.

*****EMBROIDERY KITS*****
Needle
Found on: Cactuars
Cost: 2500 gil*
Can be used to make: Misangas, Charms and Talismans
Needles are just needles. They are one of the most important tools in 
embroidery sets nowadays. Of course, the Needles of Final Fantasy: Crystal 
Chronicles are not made from Iridium, instead, they are just cactus needles. 
To get a needle, you must travel all the way to Lynari Desert, kill some 
Cactuars and they may drop Needles for your use. Needles in this game are 
the materials used in many embroidery products, in particular the Blue 
Misanga, White Misanga, Speed Charm, Speed Talisman, Wisdom Charm and 
Wisdom Talisman.

Blue Silk
Found on: Many different enemies and Karl Linay
Cost: 1000 gil
Can be used to make: Blue Misanga, Zeal Headband
The world of Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles mainly uses one type of 
fabric, and that is silk. First, they obtain the silk, then they dye it 
blue for Blue Silk. Blue Silk can be bought from Karl Linay on Leuda for 
a sum of 1000 gil. Otherwise, you can just go after some enemies like Ghosts 
and they will drop the Blue Silk. Blue Silk can be used to craft the Blue 
Misanga, which can help your character resist poisoning, or the Zeal 
Headband for men, which decreases the Focus Attack Charge Time slightly. 
Now you know when to keep it.

White Silk
Found on: Many different enemies
Cost: 3000 gil*
Can be used to make: White Misanga, Healing Headband
The world of Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles mainly uses one type of 
fabric, and that is silk. First, they obtain the silk, then they dye it 
white for White Silk. There is a reason why White Silk can only be obtained 
by defeating enemies like Ghosts. This is because, White Silk can simply 
be used to make more powerful accessories. One of them is the White Misanga, 
which protects your character against Curse. The other is the Healing 
Headband, which offers male character increased rate of HP Regeneration.

*****ELEMENTAL MATERIALS*****
Magma Rock
Found on: Fire element enemies and merchants
Cost: 1000 gil
Can be used to make: Flame Mail, Flame Badge
The Magma Rock is well, a piece of hot solidified lava. They can be found 
mainly in Mt. Kilanda. On the other hand, Fire element enemies may carry 
Magma Rocks as well. Your prime targets will be the Fire Bombs, Lava Mus, 
Lava Ahrimans and other enemies with the Fire element. The Magma Rock, 
although it can only be used to make 2 items, those 2 items are still very 
important to your character. Both the Flame Mail and Flame Badge are used 
to protect your character from Fire. Finally, Magma Rocks can be bought 
from your local merchant if he has developed good relationships with his 
son/daughter in your caravan.

Chilly Gel
Found on: Ice element enemies and merchants
Cost: 1000 gil
Can be used to make: Frost Mail, Frost Badge
The Chilly Gel is well, some rather cold and gelatinous substance. They 
can be found mainly cold and damp places like Veo Lu Sluice or Conall Curach. 
On the other hand, Ice element enemies may carry Chilly Gel as well. Your 
prime targets will be the Ice Bombs, Snow Mus, Water Flans and other enemies 
with the Ice element. The Chilly Gel, although it can only be used to make 
2 items, those 2 items are still very important to your character. Both 
the Frost Mail and Frost Badge are used to protect your character from 
Cold. Finally, Chilly Gel can be bought from your local merchant if he 
has developed good relationships with his son/daughter in your caravan.

Thunderball
Found on: Electric element enemies and merchants
Cost: 1000 gil
Can be used to make: Lightning Mail, Lightning Badge
No, this is not anything to do with one of those James Bond movies in the 
60s. The Thunderball is some ball with electric charges on it, perhaps. 
They can be found anywhere, as it has nothing to do with the climate. On 
the other hand, Electric element enemies may carry Thunderballs as well. 
Your prime targets will be the Thunder Bombs, Electric Jellyfish and other 
enemies with the Electric element. The Thunderball, although it can only 
be used to make 2 items, those 2 items are still very important to your 
character. Both the Lightning Mail and Lighting Badge are used to protect 
your character from Lightning. Finally, Thunderballs can be bought from 
your local merchant if he has developed good relationships with his 
son/daughter in your caravan.

*****SPOILS FROM ENEMIES*****
Griffin's Wing
Found on: Griffins
Cost: 2000 gil*
Can be used to make: Winged Belt, Eagle Goggles
You know those Griffins, don't you? They are those massive birds that are 
always grounded and cannot fly. When you kill one, it may drop its wing 
for you to retrieve. This item is particularly useful for Selkies as it 
can be used to make the Winged Belt and Eagle Googles, which are an armor 
and an accessory respectively.

Cerberus Fang
Found on: Cerberuses
Cost: 3000 gil*
Can be used to make: Valiant Weapon, Lion's Heart
In this game, the fangs of Cerberuses can be obtained after you kill one. 
Ceberuses are those giant hellhounds you find in Goblin Wall and Rebena 
Te Ra. They are quite tough, but once they die, you may find a Cerberus 
Fang on the ground. It can be used to craft the Valiant Weapon, which is 
not very worthy, or can be used to craft the Lion's Heart, an accessory 
for Lilties.

Worm Antenna
Found on: Carrion Worms
Cost: 2000 gil*
Can be used to make: Time Mail, Time Helm, Accurate Watch
As you can see, there are two types of worms in Final Fantasy: Crystal 
Chronicles. There are Tiny Worms and Carrion Worms. The larger Carrion 
Worms have an antenna big enough for use to craft items. Worm Antennas 
can be used to craft things that can help your character resist Slow, like 
the Time Mail, Time Helm and Accurate Watch.

Faerie's Tear
Found on: Ahrimans and Karl Linay
Cost: 1000 gil
Can be used to make: Pixie's Earring
God knows what a Faerie is, but an Ahriman may carry this weird material. 
So will Karl Linay. These items are only useful for Lilties, as they can 
be used to craft the Pixie's Earring, which only Lilties can use.

Angel's Tear
Found on: Ahrimans and Lava Ahrimans
Cost: 1000 gil*
Can be used to make: Angel's Earring
On the other hand, Ahrimans may also drop Angel's Tears. God knows where 
they can find angels crying. This is only useful for Selkies, as it is 
used to craft the Angel's Earring, which only Selkies can use.

Fiend's Claw:
Found on: Various Enemies and Karl Linay
Cost: 1000 gil
Can be used to make: Daemon's Earring
Different enemies will drop this, as there are no enemies called fiends 
in the game. However, I really cannot remember all the enemies that actually 
have it! To be certain, go to Leuda and buy one from Karl Linay for 1000 
gil. This is used to make the Daemon's Earring only.

Ogre Fang
Found on: Ogres
Cost: 2500 gil*
Can be used to make: Victorious Weapon
Whenever you see an Ogre, you will be able to see two walrus like teeth 
sticking out. When you kill him, you may be able to take his fang! Ogre 
Fangs are pretty much useless in this game, as they only can be used to 
forge the Victorious Weapon, which is not a substantial improvement over 
the Master's Weapon. Therefore, just sell them for 625 gil apiece whenever 
you find one.

Holy Water
Found on: Wraiths and Karl Linay
Cost: 1000 gil
Can be used to make: Blessed Mail, Blessed Sash
If I had not mistaken, Holy Water used to be a healing item in Final Fantasy 
X. But now, it is used to craft materials in this game. Holy Water can 
be found on Wraiths in Daemon's Court, or it can be bought from Karl Linay 
for 1000 gil a piece. Holy Water can be used to craft Blessed Mail and 
the Blessed Sash, which protects your character from poisoning.

Heavenly Dust
Found on: Wriaths and Karl Linay
Cost: 1000 gil
Can be used to make: Saintly Shield, Saintly Mail
Heavenly Dust is another material that can be found on Wriaths or bought 
from Karl Linay. This time, it can be used to make Saintly Mail and Saintly 
Shields, which both protects your character against curses.

Hard Shell
Found on: Blazer Beetles
Cost: 2000 gil*
Can be used to make: Diamond Armor
What do beetles have? That's right, they have hard shells, and that is 
what you may get when you defeat a Blazer Beetle. Yes, although there is 
only one use for the Hard Shells, it is NOT useless. After all, Diamond 
Armor requires a Hard Shell in order to be forged. So be prepared.

Gigas Claw
Found on: Gigas
Cost: 2500 gil*
Can be used to make: Speed Charm
A Gigas is basically the minature field version of Jack Moschet. Their 
claws are useful to Selkies only, as they can be used to craft the Speed 
Charm, which only Selkies can be equipped with.

Cockatrice Scale
Found on: Cockatrices
Cost: 2000 gil*
Can be used to make: Gold Necklace, Gold Armlets
Cockatrices are yet another type of bird like creature. Their body is so 
covered with scales that they will drop one of them when they are killed. 
It seems that Cockatrice Scales are to be used in conjunction with Gold 
all the time, as they can only be used to craft Gold Necklaces and Gold 
Armlets.

Coeurl Whisker
Found on: Coeurls
Cost: 2000 gil*
Can be used to make: Wizard's Soul, Wisdom Charm, Rune Shield
You know those yellow dog like creatures that cast spells on you? Well, 
they are Coeurls. It's amazing that even dogs can have whiskers. Because 
there is so much magic in those Whiskers, the Coeurl Whiskers can be used 
to craft accessories that can improve your character's magic abilities 
like the Wizard's Soul, Wisdom Charm and the Rune Shield.

Gear
Found on: Skeletons
Cost: 1000 gil*
Can be used to make: Accurate Watch, Unfaltering Watch
You know what gears are? They are just cogs that keep the mechanisms inside 
clocks and other machines running. Of course, the only machines your 
characters will be using are the Accurate Watch and the Unfaltering Watch, 
and that's what you need Gears for. I have no idea why you may find Gears 
on skeletons. Maybe it is because they are mechanical skeletons.

Jagged Scythe
Found on: Abbadons
Cost: 4000 gil*
Can be used to make: Mighty Weapon
An abbadon has 2 claws, both with Jagged Scythes. Whenever you kill one, 
they may drop a Jagged Scuthe for you to collect. However, Jagged Scythes 
are not very useful, as they can only be used to forge the Mighty Weapon. 
I would rather sell these instead. You can get 1000 gil from selling each 
of them. Which is not bad.

Yellow Feather
Found on: Tonberry Chefs
Cost: 4000 gil*
Can be used to make: Chocobo Shield
My personal guess is that Tonberry Chefs of Moschet Manor wear Yellow 
Feathers for decoration. However, if you are a Clavat, this tiny little 
feather is not to be underestimated, as it can be used to forge the Chocobo 
Shield, which is the most powerful secondary armor in the game. However, 
if you are not a Clavat, it is still worth keeping because of its sell 
value of 1000 gil.

Toad Oil
Found on: Gigan Toads
Cost: 2000 gil*
Can be used to make: Eternal Mail, Eternal Helm, Unfaltering Watch
Well, it seems that many toads have skins with rather poisonous secretions, 
and the Gigan Toads are not an exception. The only thing different is that 
they secret some rather useful and non-poisonous oils which can be used 
to make armor and accessories that help protect your character against 
Stasis. The Eternal Mail, Eternal Helm and Unfaltering Watch are the uses.

Devil's Claw
Found on: Nightmares
Cost: 3000 gil*
Can be used to make: Devil's Earring
Well, there really are no devils in this game, just their claws, and they 
are found on those evil horses called Nightmares in Rebena Te Ra. There 
really is only one use for this material, and it is only for Clavats. IT 
can be used to make the Devil's earring. How evil are the Clavats!

Zu's Beak
Found on: Zus
Cost: 3000 gil*
Can be used to make: Speed Talisman
It is obvious isn't it? Zu's beaks belong to Zus, which can only be found 
in the Lynari Desert. There really is only ONE use for the Zu's Beak, and 
that is to make the Speed Talisman, who only Selkies can use. Otherwise, 
be prepared to dump this useless material at a merchant near you.

Chimera's Horn
Found on: Chimeras
Cost: 2500 gil*
Can be used to make: Dragoon's Spear, Twisted Scope, Wisdom Talisman
This is well, the horn of a Chimera, which again can only be found in the 
Lynari Desert unless you would like to go all the way to Mount Vellenge. 
There are a couple of uses for a Chimera's Horn, only that it is most useful 
for Clavats, as it can craft them 2 of their accessories.

*****SPOILS FROM BOSSES*****
Ancient Sword
Found on: Giant Crab (~150 points)
Cost: 30000 gil*
Can be used to make: Ragnarok
When you battle the Giant Crab, you may find that he has a triceratops 
style horn on his head. Stuck on the horn is some kind of sword. That is 
the Ancient Sword. I guess that once you have knocked his horn off, the 
Ancient Sword must have flown into the bushes without being broken. If 
you get somewhere around 150 bonus points, then your character may be able 
to salvage it. However, the Ancient Sword is only useful for Clavats, as 
it can be used to forge their Dark Weapon. The Ragnarok.

Cursed Crook
Found on: Goblin King (~198 points)
Cost: 30000 gil*
Can be used to make: Ragnarok, Bishop's Soul
When you fought the Goblin King of Goblin Wall, you will notice that the 
Goblin King is holding some kind of a magic staff that he uses to cast 
various kinds of spells on you. That is the Cursed Crook. The Cursed Crook 
is found in the Power Set of Goblin Wall, and to be able to select it, 
you should get around (~198 points) in the level in order to have a 25% 
chance of being able to select it. The Cursed Crook is useful to Clavats, 
as it can also be used to forge the Ragnarok, and it is also useful for 
Yukes, as it can be used to craft the Bishop's Soul.

Malboro Seed
Found on: Malboro (~189 points)
Cost: 30000 gil*
Can be used to make: Elemental's Soul
The Malboro is a giant mutant plant in the Mushroom Forest, and it has 
a stock of seeds hidden deep inside its body. If you do defeat it and get 
around 189 points, you may be able to have the honour of dissecting and 
anatomizing the Malboro, and finding its seed! However, this seed is only 
useful to Yukes, as it is used to craft an accessory for them called the 
Elemental's Soul. If you are of any other race, ignore the seed.

Orc Belt
Found on: Orc King (~218 points)
Cost: 30000 gil*
Can be used to make: Dragon's Heart, Thief's Emblem
When you first meet the Orc King in the Mine of Carthuiges, you will notive 
that he is wearing a rather large and wide belt around his waist, and that 
is his Orc Belt. If your character beats him while gaining around 218 bonus 
points, then you may be able to strip the Orc King's belt and use it for 
your own! (Amazing that you can carry such a heavy belt.) However, the 
Orc Belt is only useful for the Lilties and Selkies, as it can be used 
to craft the Dragon's Heart for Lilties and the Thief's Emblem for the 
Selkies.

Wind Crystal
Found on: Cave Worm (~218 points)
Cost: 30000 gil*
Can be used to make: Dreamcatcher, Thief's Emblem
I have no idea how this has anything got to do with a Cave Worm. My guess 
is that it is found inside the Cave Worm, and allows him to generate winds 
by inhaling and exhaling air. If you get around 218 bonus points upon 
beating the Cave Worm, then you will get to anatomize it and get its Wind 
Crystal. However, this crystal is only useful to Selkies, as it is used 
to forge the Dreamcatcher and the Thief's Emblem, which are a weapon and 
an accessory for Selkies respectively.

King's Scale
Found on: Lizardman King (~130 points)
Cost: 30000 gil*
Can be used to make: Gaia Plate
The Lizardman King of Daemon's Court really does have such large scales. 
If you beat him inside the colloseum with around 130 points, then you can 
get a free scale off him as a souvenir. However, besides being a selling 
item, the King's Scale is only useful for Clavats, as it can be used to 
forge their Earth Armor, which is their Gaia Plate.

Dweomer Spore:
Found on: Armstrong (~213 points)
Cost: 30000 gil*
Can be used to make: Elemental's Soul
Armstrong is some kind of live building sort of boss found in Tida. But 
for some strange reason, Armstrong also exhibits some plant properties. 
In fact, he can give out spores. If you beat him with around 213 points, 
then you will have a 25% chance of salvaging a spore from him. This spore 
really is expernsive, but is only useful for Yukes, as it can only be used 
to craft the Elemental's Soul, an accessory for Yukes.

Lord's Robe
Found on: Gigas Lord (~130 points)
Cost: 30000 gil*
Can be used to make: Gaia Plate
As you can see, Jack Moschet of the Moschet Manor is always wearing 
something that looks like a bathrobe. That is the Gigas Robe. If you can 
defeat him with around 130 points, then you can get to strip him of his 
robe at his home! However, this souvenir is only useful to Clavats, as 
it is one of the 3 materials used to forge the Earth Armor of the Clavats, 
which is the Gaia Plate, the strongest armor in the game.

Green Sphere
Found on: Golem (~120 points)
Cost: 30000 gil*
Can be used to make: Thief's Emblem
You will notice that the Golem will have some kind of sphere in the center 
of his body which I guess will show its emotions. It is usually green, 
and it can turn red if the Golem is angry. When you have beaten the Golem 
with around 120 bonus points, you may be able to salvage the Green Sphere 
of the Golem's body. However, this sphere is only useful to Selkies only, 
as it is used to raft an accessory for them called the Thief's Emblem.

Dragon Fang
Found on: Dragon Zombie (~261 points)
Cost: 30000 gil*
Can be used to make: Dragoon's Spear, Longinus, Dragon's Heart
Although the Dragon Zombie is rather undead, its fangs are still real. 
If you defeat the Dragon Zombie with around 261 points, then you may get 
to salvage a Dragon Fang after he disappears. However, it really is only 
useful for Lilties, as it can be used to craft 3 things, the Dragoon's 
Spear, Longinous and the Dragon's Heart accessory, that can only be used 
by Lilties. Otherwise, it's useless.

Ethereal Orb
Found on: Lich (~207 points)
Cost: 30000 gil*
Can be used to make: Elemental's Soul
I have no idea what this is. My guess is that it is one of those balls 
on poles in the room where you fight the Lich in Rebena Te Ra. If you defeat 
the Lich with about 207 points, then you may get to choose this on the 
Item Selection Screen. This material is only useful for Yukes, as it can 
only be used to craft the Elemental's Soul, which only Yukes can use.

Red Eye
Found on: Iron Giant (~177 points)
Cost: 30000 gil*
Can be used to make: Longinus
The Iron Giant has 2 eyes that are rather red. If you can beat him with 
around 177 points, then your character has a 25% chance of being able to 
pluck the eye straight from his metallic socket and use it as a material. 
As for usefulness, I must say that it is very useful to Lilties only. This 
is because it can be used to craft the Celestial Weapon for the Lities, 
which is the Longinus. Otherwise, simply ignore this booty.

Desert Fang
Found on: Antlion (~180 points)
Cost: 30000 gil*
Can be used to make: Dreamcatcher
The Desert Fang has 2 gigantic fangs sticking out of his mouth for him 
to bite your character with, and when you beat him with about 180 bonus 
points, your character may get to choose this fang in the Item Selection 
Screen. God knows how he/she can carry it. Anyway, this fang is only useful 
to Selkies only, as it can only be used to forge the Dreamcatcher, which 
is the Lunar Weapon of the Selkies.

*****MATERIALS FOR ONE GENDER*****
Pressed Flower
Found on: Sahagin Lord??
Cost: 1000 gil*
Can be used to make: Flower Bracer, Jade Bracer
This has got to be the material that is for women only. This is because 
it is used to craft two accessories which are for women, and hence are 
no use for men. Pressed Flowers can appear anywhere, but I only have picked 
them up from Sahagin Lords in Conall Curach or have received them via mail. 
My guess is that women love things poetic, and that flowers are just the 
delicate and poetic stuff that women and girls like!

Remedy
Found on: Sahagin Lord??
Cost: 1000 gil*
Can be used to make: Zeal Headband, Healing Headband
This has got to be the material that is for men only. This is because it 
is used to craft two accessories which are for men, and hence are no use 
for women. Remedies can appear anywhere, but I only have picked them up 
from Sahagin Lords in Conall Curach or have received them via mail. My 
guess is that men are sporty types of people, and in such hectic times, 
they would need stuff to help them relax and replenish their body fluids 
and so on, and remedies can help them in recovering from those various 
ailments!!

*****ULTIMATE MATERIALS*****
Ultimite
Found on: Local Merchant
Cost: 50000 gil
Can be used to make: Ultimate Weapon
The sole purpose of this horrendously overpriced material is to forge the 
Ultimate Weapon, which is usually not the best weapon when compared to 
other powerful weapons like the Longinus, Dreamcatcher or Ragnarok.

Dark Sphere
Found on: Local Merchant
Cost: 50000 gil
Can be used to make: Force Ring
The sole purpose of this horrendously overpriced material is to craft the 
Force Ring, which only protects your character against knock backs, and 
this is not worth it as well.

-----------------------------
h. Design Locations [FFCC3H]
-----------------------------
Recently, I have received an e-mail from someone who told me that I should 
add an individual list that shows the locations of the designs of the game, 
as it is so difficult to find them when they are embedded in the walkthrough 
of the game. So now, I will add the design locations and descriptions in 
the game.

Greatest Weapon.

The Lion Soul is found on a dead end island in Conall Curach. It makes 
an accessory which increases the focus attack power of the Lilty.

Dragon Soul
Makes: Dragon's Heart
Found in: Conall Curach
To get the Dragon Soul, you must beat Conall Curach with around 300 points 
in single player game! This accessory increases the power of the focus 
attack even more.

*****ACCESSORIES FOR YUKES*****
Wisdom Tome
Makes: Wisdom Charm
Found in: Goblin Wall
I forgot where I picked this one up, I think it must have been the Goblin 
Wall. The accessory made can help decrease the Yuke's spell casting time, 
but not as much as the Wisdom Talisman.

Fiend Kit
Makes: Daemon's Earring
Found in: Mushroom Forest
This all purpose pack to deal with fiends makes the Daemon's Earring, an 
accessory which allows the Yuke to have increased effects on his enemies 
whenever he casts a spell on them. It is also found in the Mushroom Forest.

Eyewear Techniques:
Makes: Twisted Spectacles
Found in: Lynari Desert
Given the Eyewear Techniques, the tailor can craft the twisted spectales 
for the Yukes to wear, this one increases their spell range. The design 
is found in Lynari Desert, in the same chest that the Twisted Scope may 
be found. So it is randomized around here.

Magic Tome
Makes: Wizard's Soul
Found in: Rebena Te Ra
The Magic Tome can be used to craft the Wizard's Soul, which can help 
increase the Yuke's magic damage. It is found in Rebena Te Ra.

Sorcery Tome
Makes: Bishop's Soul
Found in: Rebena Te Ra
The Sorcery Tome can be used to craft the Bishop's Soul, which increases 
the Yuke's Magic Power even more than the Magic Tome. Like the Magic Tome, 
the design is found in Rebena Te Ra.

Forbidden Tome
Makes: Elemental's Soul
Found in: Rebena Te Ra
This tome is the hardest to find. To get it, you must beat Rebena Te Ra 
with around 230 points in a single player game. Good luck, as this maximizes 
the Yukes' magic power.

*****ACCESSORIES FOR SELKIES*****
Speed Tome
Makes: Speed Charm
Found in: Mine of Carthuiges
This design makes the Speed Charm, which lowers the Focus Attack Charge 
time of Selkies. The design can be found in the Mine of Carthuiges.

Angel Kit
Makes: Angel's Earring
Found in: Tida
This design makes the Angel's Earring, which helps your Selkie resist 
status ailments. The design can be found in Tida.

Designer Goggles
Makes: Eagle Goggles
Found in: Lynari Desert
Given the designer goggles, the tailor can craft a pair of Eagle Goggles, 
which increases the Focus Attack Range of Selkies. The design is found 
in the same chest which the Twisted Scope may be found.

Speed Secrets
Makes: Speed Talisman
Found in: Mine of Carthuiges
The secrets of speed enable the Selkies to craft the Speed Talisman, which 
lowers the focus attack charge time more than the Speed Charm does. The 
design is also found in the Mine of Carthuiges.

Brigandology
Makes: Thief's Emblem
Found in: Tida
Brigandology is a design for such a powerful accessory that it can only 
be found by beating the boss of Tida with around 210 points in single player.

*****OTHER ACCESSORIES*****
Ring of Light
Makes: Crystal Ring
Found in: Selepation Cave
The Ring of Light is the design for the Crystal Ring, an accessory which 
helps your character resist miasma. It is found in Selepation Cave.

Ring of Invinciblity
Makes: Force Ring
Found in: Village Alchemist
The Ring of Invincibility is obtained by sending stuff home to your 
alchemist father for 11 years straight. The Force Ring crafted helps your 
character by preventing him/her from knocked back.

---------------------
i. My Party [FFCC3I]
---------------------
OK, different people have different ways to play Final Fantasy: Crystal 
Chronicles. Some people will just make one character, beef him/her up, 
and beat the game in 15 hours. Some will create all 8 characters, beef 
them all up, and beat the game with their character of choice, studying 
as many things in detail as possible, taking over 2 months before they 
beat the game. I belong to the latter type of people.

There are 4 stats in the game, they are Strength, which is your physical 
attack power, Defense, which is how well you can take hits from enemies, 
Magic, which is the attack power of your character in using spells and 
Memories, which is a numerical representation of how often you used a 
character. Whenever a new diary entry is written, the character's Memories 
increase by 1.

In fact, I have made 7 people out of the 8 slots, and 2 of them are the 
main characters, with all 3 stats over 60 (Attack and Defense over 70), 
while 4 others have at least 50 strength, 50 defense. I created a new 
character recently and started to raise her too. In my party, there are 
3 Clavats, 2 Selkies, 1 Yuke and 1 Lilty. Here are the names and identities 
of the 7 characters in my party.

-----------------------------------------------
Main Characters (Can be used to beat the game)
-----------------------------------------------
---------------
Aladair
---------------
Tribe: Clavat	Gender: Male	Appearance: Natural
Trade: Blacksmith

Stats:
Strength: 85
Defense: 84
Magic: 82
Memories: >100*
Number of Hearts: 7
Number of Command Slots: 8*

Equipment: Excalibur, Gaia Plate, Chocobo Shield, Wisdom Talisman

Judging by the high Memories this character has, you will find that he 
is the most used character in the game. In fact, he is the first character 
I created. I had to call him Aladair instead of Alasdair (my name), because 
there is a 7 letter limit in the naming system, and this is just sad. Aladair 
has the most powerful shield in the game, and he has finally got the Gaia 
Plate by beating Selepation Cave with 264 points. When I first beat the 
game, all 3 main stats above are over 60. The Wisdom Talisman is chosen 
so powerful spells can be cast quicker than usual, making Aladair an all 
round party member.

---------------
Paul
---------------
Tribe: Selkie	Gender: Male	Apperance: Shark Eyes
Trade: Alchemist

Stats:
Strength: 73
Defense: 80
Magic: 75
Memories: >100*
Number of Hearts: 8*
Number of Command Slots: 7

Equipment: Dreamcatcher, Diamond Plate, Diamond Belt, Healing Headband

Paul is the second most used character when I played Final Fantasy: Crystal 
Chronicles. I named him after my older cousin in the UK. Paul is another 
of my favorites, as he is just so fast. His armor has already been upgraded 
to the max, but his weapons have not. I have the design for the Lunar Weapon 
(Dreamcatcher), however, I have found the materials to make the weapon 
and made it already. (I need a desert fang from the Antlion boss of Lynari 
Desert, and the Wind Crystal from the Cave Worm in Selepation Cave). Of 
course, the Healing Headband, coupled with the 8 hearts I have will give 
Paul a very powerful defense, with his already fast speed.

--------------------------------------------------------
Supporting Characters (Can be used to beat most levels)
--------------------------------------------------------
---------------
Lisa
---------------
Tribe: Lilty	Gender: Female	Appearance: Bare Head
Trade: Tailor

Stats:
Strength: 65
Defense: 67
Magic: 51
Memories: <100
Number of Hearts: 6
Number of Command Slots: 5

Equipment: Gungnir, Flame Mail, Frost Armlets, Jade Bracer

Lisa is an Apple Head, named after my rather hot tempered cousin in the 
UK, younger than me by a year. As Lisa is a Lilty, and Lilties are meant 
to be proficient in physical attacks, I chose to focus on her Strength 
and Defense, while keeping her Magic at an average stat. At the same time, 
the Number of Command Slots was still left at 5, because I will not cast 
too many spells. The Flame Mail and Frost Armlets can provide protection 
to fire and ice, while the Jade Bracer helps her to recover health, and 
this will help in a brawl.

---------------
Peter
---------------
Tribe: Clavat	Gender: Male	Appearance: Headband
Trade: Farmer

Stats:
Strength: 53
Defense: 53
Magic: 35
Memories: <100
Number of Hearts: 6
Number of Command Slots: 5

Equipment: Excalibur, Flame Mail, Mythril Shield, Wisdom Talisman

I have another cousin, who loves to play Final Fantasy, all of those on 
the PS2, as well as this one. He wanted me to create a character after 
him. I originally wanted to make him a Yuke, however, he refused, saying 
that Yukes are too ugly. That's what he has become now. I basically use 
Peter for experimental purposes. Before I craft any accessories for Aladair, 
I will let Peter try it, and see how it works. That is why he has the Wisdom 
Talisman. I rarely use Peter now, only when he is here, or when I play 
a 2 player game with him.

---------------
Joyce
---------------
Tribe: Yuke	Gender: Female	Appearance: Spoon
Trade: Fisherman

Stats:
Strength: 53
Defense: 56
Magic: 61
Memories: <100
Number of Hearts: 6
Number of Command Slots: 5

Equipment: Goblin Hammer, Flame Mail, Time Helm, Flame Badge

As I did not get the chance to let Peter be the Yuke, I will just have 
to make Joyce a Yuke. Being the only Yuke in the game, I will try my best 
to make Joyce as balanced as possible, and now look at her 3 stats, see 
how the Magic Stat exceeds all the other stats, that's how I would raise 
this Yuke. Joyce is double protected against Fire, so even Firaga cannot 
set her on fire. The Time Helm can help her against any slowdowns, except 
the Slowga move, and this can allow her to cast spells as quickly as 
possible.

---------------
David
---------------
Tribe: Selkie	Gender: Male	Appearance: Raccoon Tail
Trade: Merchant

Stats:
Strength: 61
Defense: 60
Magic: 58
Memories: <100
Number of Hearts: 7
Number of Command Slots: 6

Equipment: Queen's Heel, Diamond Plate, Mythril Belt, Speed Talisman

This time, I am naming this character after my best friend, and his trade 
suits his trade in the real world, as David's father is a manager in a 
wholesale firm! Anyway, David is the 3rd strongest character in the party, 
and I use him quite a lot when I do not want to use Paul. He does not have 
a good belt yet, I guess I will see to that a little bit later. His Speed 
Talisman can help him charge his focus attacks even faster, making him 
even faster than Paul. Yes, and my friend was shocked to see him look so 
much like a girl around here.

------------------------
Newly Created Character
------------------------
--------------
Kathryn
--------------
Tribe: Clavat	Gender: Female	Appearance: Long Hair
Trade: Miller

Stats:
Strength: 57
Defense: 57
Magic: 32
Memories: <20
Number of Hearts: 4
Number of Command Slots: 5

Equipment: Excalibut, Diamond Armor, Diamond Shield

Kathryn is a newly created character that I made recently. I am now raising 
her stats slowly. Here's how I do it. It can also serve as a guideline 
for those who would like to raise new characters when all enemies in 
dungeons are so strong.

Firstly, you should have 2 Gameboy Advances and Link Cables. Play a 
multiplayer game, with the strong character as Player 1, while the weaker 
one is at Player 2. As soon as you have control of the characters, press 
select on the GBA connected to Controller Socket 2. The weak character 
will now simply follow your strong character around, doing nothing. Beat 
the boss of the level and then you can just stuff your weaker character 
with stat enhancing artifacts until she is competitive enough. At the same 
time, look for the design for a Legendary Weapon, a chunk or Orichalum, 
a piece of Alloy and Ancient Potion. Give them all to the weak character. 
Then give her 5000 gil. Then, she can obtain the legendary weapon and have 
a large boost in Strength. Same goes for the Armor.

So, now Kathryn has a decent strength and defense, and all that's left 
to do is to collect as many artifacts she can get her hands on, and finding 
the Chocobo Shield and Gaia Plate to maximize her defensive capabilities.

----------------------
The Optimum Tribesmen
----------------------
Now that I have introduced all the stat enhancing artifacts to you, it 
is time for me to show you the optimum stats for each tribe. This can clearly 
show which tribe is strong at what. Note that none of my characters are 
of the optimum tribesmen. The figures are there after some calculations. 
So, do not blame me if I made a mistake.

The Cleverest Clavat
Strength: 91
Defense: ***97***
Magic: 95
Number of Hearts: 8
Number of Command Slots: 8
Mean Stat: 94.3
Median Stat: 95

Equipment: Ragnarok, Gaia Plate, Chocobo Shield, Wisdom Talisman

Well, the manual has always said that the Clavats are the best in Defense, 
and having 99 as the maximum value really is amazing. I guess the main 
reason for not allowing the Clavat to have a 3 digit value in Defense is 
so that the system would not have a serious error! The Clavat's Strength 
ain't too shabby either. Coming in 91 is not really bad, and this puts 
them in third place behind Selkies and Lilties. The 95 second most powerful 
Magic is even more enhanced by the Wisdom Talisman, which is easy to craft 
and speeds up spell casting tenfold.

The Liveliest Liltie
Strength: ***98***
Defense: 92
Magic: 92
Number of Hearts: 8
Number of Command Slots: 8
Mean Stat: 94
Median Stat: 92

Equipment: Longinus, Diamond Plate, Diamond Armlets, Dragon's Heart

The Lilties are rather lively for appleheads, and this absolutely high 
Strength very well proves it. Thanks to the Longinus, a very powerful weapon 
that has a focus attack that hits enemies 5 times, the Lilties can get 
40 of their Strength from the weapon alone! The Lilties' powerful Strength 
can be enhanced by the Dragon's Heart, which makes their Focus Attack even 
more powerful. The Lilties' Defense is not bad, although the magic may 
seem to be a bit lacking here and there. Therefore, you should always try 
to collect the Strength Boosting Artifacts as the highest priority.

The Yuppie Yuke
Strength: 90
Defense: 89
Magic: ***97***
Number of Hearts: 8
Number of Command Slots: 8
Mean Stat: 92
Median Stat: 90

Equipment: Mystic Hammer, Diamond Plate, Diamond Helm, Elemental's Soul

Yukes are the masters of Magic, but are relatively, I SAY RELATIVELY, weak 
at other aspects. They have such a whoppingly high Magic Stat at 97, 
although it really is not a big lead over the second placed Clavats, but 
what the heck. Anyway, their potential in Magic can be mastered even more 
thoroughly by simply equipping the rather hard to craft Elemental's Soul, 
which significantly increases their Spell Damage, although the Clavats 
will be way faster with the Wisdom Talisman equipped, the Yukes' highest 
priority is to well, increase their damage.

The Serious Selkie
Strength: 92
Defense: 90
Magic: 94
Mean Stat: 92
Median Stat: 90

Equipment: Dreamcatcher, Diamond Plate, Diamond Belt, Thief's Emblem

Selkies are yet another all-rounded tribe. Their maximum stats are so close 
to each other. Their Strength may only be slightly stronger than Clavats, 
but yet it can go a long way. This is because Selkies have the fastest 
Focus attack in the game, which can be enhanced to the max with the Thief's 
Emblem. However, Selkies are no match to Lilties, not only they are 6 
Strength behind, the Lilties can have their Focus Attack damage enhanced! 
Their Defense is mediocre, but not as weak as the Yukes, however, their 
Magic really has nothing to offer, no enhancements, no nothing.

Summary: 
The Lilties and Selkies are the best attackers in the game, the former 
being the hardest hitter, the latter being the fastest fighter. The Clavats 
and Yukes are the best magicians in the game, the former being the fastest 
caster, the latter being the most damaging caster. Clavats are the 
strongest defenders of the game. Clavats, having no stats that are the 
worst of the 4 tribes, and have a specialty of their own, are the most 
balanced tribesmen of Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles.

---------------------------------
j. Beginning your Quest [FFCC3J]
---------------------------------
Having read all of the above, I assume that you have known what the basics 
of the game. Therefore, let us begin. Select New Game on the opening menu, 
and select the single player or multiplayer mode, depending on how many 
players are there. Then, you will be treated to the opening credits, where 
a woman called Donna Burke will sing the opening song called "Morning Sky", 
and you will see different people of the 4 tribes of the world, men and 
women, being recruited to collect myrrh, and how they fight monsters to 
the myrrh, and what it is like to be on the road at night and so on.
These are the lyrics of the song.

*****MORNING SKY*****
Dreaming of the stars on high,
That speak to me in secret sighs,
Drifting on a breeze,
Only I can feel and hear.

Could it be the sacred wind,
That's calling me to now begin,
To walk into the dark,
Carrying the light of tomorrow?

Need to walk the wings on high,
Beyond the earth, beyond the sky,
Come on, don't hesitate,
Don't look back, we've got to go now?

Don't fear,
You'll be safe from now on,
Morning sky watching over all.

Deep inside so silently,
My heart will speak,
Deep inside of me,
Memories flickering and shimmering on,
Endlessly.

Keeping close to the path,
Morning sky watching over all.

Moving over endless mountains oh so high,
Walking to the light,
Your heart will,
See the path and you will find your way,
Just wait and see.

Moving under endless skies oh so high,
Tomorrow we'll follow, when in doubt,
Your promises today,
Just wait and see.

After the opening credits, you will be asked to name the village you come 
from. I will refer the village as Tipa, by default. You then can set up 
and create your caravan members. I recommend creating two at the start. 
Then, you can begin your journey.

Once you leave Tipa, you will encounter another caravan in the first 
junction you reach. They will give you a moogle. After that, go west to 
enter Port Tipa. In Port Tipa, run all the way down to the bottom and talk 
to the moogle there. He will provide training for your character. Just 
do as he says, and you will be fine. Now, go back up the slope, and enter 
that hole in the cliff. It's a moogle house. Talk to the moogle inside 
and he will place a mog stamp on your card. Now, get out and get back out 
to the World Map.

Now, I suggest you visit the dungeons in this order for the first two years:

Year 1: River Belle Path, Goblin Wall, Mushroom Forest
Year 2: Mine of Carthuriges, Tida, Moschet Manor

Then, feel free to travel anywhere you like the years after. It really 
is quite open-ended beyond this point.

Now, another important business is to have weapons forged for your 
characters. Depending on what characters you use, you should start with 
the following weapons:

Clavats: Copper Sword, Strength 15, Focus Attack: Power Slash
Lilties: Iron Lance, Strength 15, Focus Attack: Cyclone Slash
Yukes: Orc Hammer, Strength 15, Focus Attack: Power Bomb
Selkies: Aura Racket, Strength 15, Focus Attack: Aura Blast.

When raising your first 2 characters, you should first upgrade to the 
Warrior's Weapon by finding the plans in the levels and the necessary 
materials. You can also buy it from a merchant. Here's how you craft the 
Warrior's Weapon.

Design: Warrior's Weapon
Weapon: Steel Blade (Clavat), Sonic Lance (Lilty), Rune Hammer (Yuke), 
Dual Shooter (Selkie)
Materials: Iron x1, Alloy x1, 300 gil
Strength: 25
All Warrior's weapons give your character 25 strength. The Clavats can 
bash the enemy, where he lunges in and digs in two hits on the poor enemy. 
The Lilties can simply charge forward, and skewer anything that gets in 
their charge. The Yukes will lunge forward and perform a shockwave on the 
enemy. The Selkie's focus attack is definitely the best, as the user will 
fire two energy blasts at the enemies, hence it is called the dual blast.

Then, you should upgrade to the Master's Weapon.

Design: Master's Weapon
Weapon: Rune Blade (Clavat), Dragon Lance (Lilty), Mythril Hammer (Yuke), 
Butterfly Head (Selkie)
Materials: Mythril x1, Alloy x1, 700 gil
Strength: 30
The Clavats this time have a ballistic focus attack called the Soulshot, 
where they can fire a tiny ball of energy at the enemy. The Lilties get 
the Pulse Thrust, it's just another of those charging attacks. The Yukes 
get the shock bomb again, and the Selkies get the Power Kick, where they 
will jump out and kick the enemy.

Afterwards, you should be able to find the plans for the Legendary Weapon, 
which usually is the 2nd strongest or already is the strongest weapon for 
that particular tribe.

Design: Legendary Weapon
Weapon: Excalibur (Clavat), Gungnir (Lilty), Goblin Hammer (Yuke), 
Queen's Heel (Selkie)
Materials: Orichalcum x1, Alloy x1, Ancient Potion x1, 2500 gil
Strength: 33 for Excalibur and Queen's Heel, 35 for Gungnir and Goblin 
Hammer
The Legendary Weapon can be found in the item selection screen after you 
beat a boss. The Same goes for Orichalcum and Ancient Potion. This is the 
only way to get those items if you do not want to go to Lynari Desert, 
Conall Curach and other difficult levels. Once you have it, you already 
would have the most powerful or the second most powerful weapon, in terms 
of strength of your tribe. The Clavats have the Soulshot as the Focus Attack, 
and they can fire a very large energy ball at the enemy. The Lilties have 
the Cross Slash, and they will charge into the enemy and hit them twice. 
The Yukes have the Magic Bomb, which is another shock wave, and the Selkies 
get the Power Kick again. Once you have it, you don't need to worry about 
the Greatest Weapon, as there is nothing so great about the Greatest Weapon, 
except it is expensive. After all, all Greatest Weapons have a Strength 
of only 33 or 35.

Lilties and the Selkies on the other hand, can do even better than the 
Legendary Weapon. The Lilties have the Celestial Weapon, and the Selkies 
have the Lunar Weapon. They are both powerful. Both can only be obtained 
in the item selection screen after you defeat the boss of a level.

Design: Celestial Weapon (Lilty)
Weapon: Longinus
Materials: Red Eye, Dragon's Fang, Orichalcum x2, 8000 gil
Strength: 40
Focus Attack: Bladestorm

Design: Lunar Weapon (Selkie)
Weapon: Dreamcatcher
Materials: Orichalcum, Wind Crystal, Desert Fang, 5000 gil
Strength: 35
Focus Attack: Meteor Blast
The Dreamcatcher is the mightiest weapon that a Selkie can wield. This 
can be proved by the Focus Attack. The Focus Attack, Meteor Blast will 
send a meteor from the sky onto the ground. This is similar to the Meteor 
Strike move of the Fire Bomb, and has just the same area effect! Now, just 
wait for the enemies to group together, and destruction guaranteed! There 
is one catch, just one catch. It is that you will have to lose half a heart 
whenever you use the Meteor Blast. But still, if you hold a Jade Bracer 
or Healing Headband while you are using it, the effects should not be felt.

The Clavats also have the Dark Weapon, which is just as strong as the Ultima 
Sword.

Design: Dark Weapon (Clavat)
Weapon: Ragnarok
Materials: Cursed Crook x1, Ancient Sword x1, Orichalum x1, 5000gil
Strength: 35
Focus Attack: Shadowblade
I have finally found the design for this weapon. The design is obtained 
when you beat Rebena Te Ra with about 177 bonus points. The Ragnarok 
requires two spoils from the bosses, both of which are easily found, as 
they are in Tipa Peninsula. The Ancient Sword is found on the Giant Crab, 
while the Cursed Crook is found on the Goblin King. The Ragnarok has a 
very powerful focus attack called the Shadow Blade. The character will 
charge forward, and hit his/her target 3 times in quick sucession. The 
only drawback is that it does not have a long range, and the player will 
lose half a heart every time he/she uses it.

As for Armor, I suggest you start upgrading with Iron Armor.

Design: Iron Armor
Armor: Iron Plate
Materials: Iron x1, 200 gil
Defense: 17

Then, upgrade to Mythril Armor.

Design: Mythril Armor
Armor: Mythril Haub.
Materials: Mythril x1, 500 gil
Defense: 25

The ultimate armor for all 4 tribes but 1 is the Diamond Armor. You can 
get it from the Item Selection Screen after you beat the boss. Otherwise, 
you can look for the design in later levels.

Design: Diamond Armor
Armor: Diamond Plate
Materials: Orichalcum x1, Hard Shell x1, Diamond Ore x1, 2500 gil
Defense: 27

For the Clavats, it does not stop here. They also can get the Earth Armor 
design, found in the Item Selection screen.

Design: Earth Armor
Armor: Gaia Plate
Materials: Lord's Robe, King's Scale, Orichalcum x2, 5000 gil
Defense: 30

The shields, gloves, helms and belts of the 4 tribes are to be upgraded 
in the same respect, the materials required are very similar, with the 
diamond version of each secondary armor having 22 Defense. The Clavats 
get to use the Legendary Shield design exclusively, found in the Item 
Selection Screen as well.

Design: Legendary Shield
Armor: Chocobo Shield
Materials: Orichalcum x2, Yellow Feather x1, 3000gil
Defense 25

Inventory Saver's Guide
------------------------
Someone has asked me to clarify the priorities of the equipment in the 
game, as he has a problem with his inventory, with it being clogged with 
useless items, so I think that I should clarify how someone should keep 
his/her equipment if he or she wants to have the maximum amount of space 
available.

*****WEAPONS*****
You should keep only the strongest weapon of your arsenal in your inventory 
if you want to save space. I now order the weapons of the game in levels, 
with a lower level being the most useless. If you have any weapons weaker 
than your best weapon, destroy it or sell the design! (Unless you are saving 
a design for another party member.)

Level	Weapon (Strength)
1.	Starting Weapon (15)
2. 	Novice's Weapon
3. 	Warrior's Weapon (25)
4. 	Master's Weapon (30)
5. 	Victorious Weapon/Valiant Weapon (31)
6. 	Mighty Weapon (32)
7. 	Legendary Weapon (33 for Clavats / Selkies, 35 for Lilties / Yukes)
8. 	Greatest Weapon (35) / Ragnarok (Clavats) (35) / Longinous 
(Lilties) (40) / Dreamcatcher (Selkies) (35)

*****ARMOR*****
As before, you should keep only 2 suits of armor in your inventory if you 
want to save space. Only keep the armor of the highest level, the others 
can be destroyed, while designs can be sold.

Armor Plates:
Level	Armor (Defense)
1.	Travel Clothes (10)
2.	Bronze Armor (13)
3.	Iron Armor (17)
4. 	Mythril Armor (22)
5.	Gold, Time, Eternal, Holy Armor, Radiant Armors (23)
6. 	Flame, Lightning, Frost Armors (24)
7.	Diamond Armor (27)
8. 	Gaia Plate (for Clavats only) (30)

Secondary Armor (Shields, Gauntlets, Helms and Belts):
Level	S. Armor (Defense)

*****ACCESSORIES*****
As for Accessories, I suggest you carry only up to 5 at a time. You should 
carry:
Up to 2 Status Ailment Protection Accessories:
Flame Badge, Lightning Badge, Frost Badge, Blue Silk, White Silk, Accurate 
Watch, Unfaltering Watch, Gold Necklace, Crystal Ring. Any 2.

Only 1 Tribe Specific Element. I suggest you select the accessory that 
increases your character's ability by the most. So, if you are a Selkie, 
and have a Thief's Emblem (Focus Attack Charge Time -15) and a Speed 
Talisman (Focus Attack Charge Time -10), keep the Thief's Emblem and 
destroy the Speed Talisman!

You can also carry a Jade Bracer (female) or a Healing Headband (male) 
in case you need constant healing. If you have, carry the Ring of 
Invincibility as well.

*****FOOD*****
If you are a beginner, carry up to 8 pieces of food with you. Food items 
like Bannnock and Milk never restore a significant amount of HP, so never 
carry any of them. If you are a confident and experienced player, carry 
6 items. If you have a Cure Ring, then you can just carry 4 as you can 
heal yourself anytime. Or carry none if you are truly daring!

*****PHOENIX DOWNS*****
Phoenix Downs are for regenerating yourself when you are killed by the 
enemies and 4 hearts are restored, like the Life spell. They only take 
effect when equipped into a Command Slot. If you are traveling to a stage 
without any Stones of Life, carry up to 2 Phoenix Downs so that you can 
use them to heal your friends. If you have the Life Ring, don't carry any! 
(I don't know why me frog carried over 20 Phoenix Downs in the final fight. 
The first time I beat the final boss, my stats were similar to his and 
I don't need ANY!) 

*****MATERIALS*****
Only carry the materials you need now to craft your new weapon, armor or 
accessory. Otherwise, sell them all for cash. Mythril and Orichalcum are 
particularly good selling items, worthing 1250 gil and 4500 gil 
respectively. Spoils from bosses can be sold for 7500 gil!

---------------
Setting Out
---------------
With the equipment taken care of, we can begin with the strategy guide 
for Tipa Peninsula. Please note that all walkthroughs for levels will 
assume that it is cycle 3. For the first time you play a level, there are 
few enemies. When the myrrh tree replenishes and you reenter the level, 
more and stronger enemies appear. This is the second cycle. Return after 
the myrrh tree replenishes itself, and you will be in the 3rd cycle, with 
even more enemies. From then on, the level will be in cycle 3 for the entire 
course of the game. Is that clear? Now, let's move on.

--------------------------
4. Strategy Guide [FFCC4]
--------------------------
OK, now for the main part of the guide, which is the strategy guide. This 
section has 9 subsections, and will cover each area of the game, one by 
one. In each level, I will first list out the enemies that appear in the 
stage, their stats, their weaknesses, and how to deal with them. Then, 
I will display the walkthrough for the level, and then the boss strategy. 
I will also jot down what you can get from the boss in the end. OK, let 
me begin with your home area Tipa Peninsula.

---------------------------
a. Tipa Peninsula [FFCC4A]
---------------------------
The Tipa Peninsula is where you begin your journey. There are a total of 
5 notable areas that you can explore, as well as 3 junctions. The areas 
are, Tipa, your hometown, River Belle Path, a level by the River Belle, 
Port Tipa, where you can receive training from a Moogle named Stiltzkin, 
and take boat rides from Tristan the Lilty; Goblin Wall, another dungeon 
in a cave that is probably the headquarters and high command of the Goblin 
division, and finally, the Miasma Stream, where you can cross over to reach 
the Iron Mine Downs.

Before you set off, let us familiarize with Tipa itself.

------------------
i. Tipa [FFCC4A1]
------------------
Type of Area: Town
Number of Blacksmiths: 1
Number of Tailors: 1
Number of Merchants: 1

This is your hometown, you are going to familiarize with the surroundings 
in this section. You go north, across the bridge into the town itself.

The first house you are going to run into is the merchant's house. Here, 
you can talk to the man of the family to buy goods. The variety of goods 
depends on the relationship of the character with his father here. The 
house to the right of the merchant's is the rancher's house, and the one 
to the left is the miller's. If you go left and follow the path, you will 
reach a river, and the fisherman's house, then you will reach a large sign 
saying, the Fields of Tipa, this is where the farmer lives. If you go further 
north, you will find the tailor's house, where you can talk to the man 
of the family there to have him craft accessories for you. The town square, 
and the crystal is to the right. 

If you go behind the crystal, you should find a small door, inside, there 
is a Moogle House, where you can paint Mog and have the resident moogle 
stamp your mog card. The house to the southwest of the crystal is the 
blacksmith's house. Talk to the man of the family and have him forge weapons 
and armor for you. The house to the right of the crystal is the Alechmist's 
house, where the Alchemist's son or daughter can receive a new weapon or 
accessory design every year if they send home stuff. The village elder 
and his wife will stand by the crystal, and if you talk to the wife, she 
will show you which elements are of each particular Miasma Stream in the 
world. On the other hand, if you go north beyond the tailor's house, you 
will come to a cliff. There, you can find a hidden item if you examine 
the pile of rocks to the right. Note that if you have not created a character 
of a particular trade, no one will be home, and there will be a moogle 
at the door of their house.

With all this information, you should know when to come back and what to 
do when you come back, now let us move on to the first level of the game, 
River Belle Path.

-------------------------------
ii. River Belle Path [FFCC4A2]
-------------------------------
Type of Area: Level
Hot Spots Present: Water, Wind

You will be briefed by the woman who sang the opening theme. She said that 
a lot of wicked creatures live on the road along this beautiful river, 
but no one has ever seen one. The typical reason is that anyone who runs 
into those monsters are promptly eaten. But as many people will not go 
through this area, no more people have been eaten. But still, some people 
will take this path, and they are the crystal caravanners, as there is 
a myrrh tree growing in a waterfall nearby.

---------------
Enemies
---------------
Goblin:
HP: 30, 37, 45
Attacks: 
Blade Slash (Blade Goblins only)
Spear Sweep (Goblin Spearmen only)
Mace Pound (Mace Wielding Goblins only)
Rock Throw (All Goblins)
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Lightning, Slow
The Goblins are the most common enemies found in River Belle Path, they 
have different weapons in hand. Some carry daggers, some carry spears and 
some carry maces. The goblins with daggers have 30 HP, the ones with spears 
have 37, and the ones with maces have 45. The daggers cannot stun your 
character, but the spears and maces can. Be aware of the spears, as they 
have a wide sweeping angle. All rocks can stun your character, although 
they are not very accurate. In spite of the vulnerabilities they have, 
using normal physical attacks will do in this case.

Dark Hedgehog (Cycle 3 Onwards):
HP: 37
Attacks:
Charging Tackle
Acrobatic Ground Slamming Shock Wave Attack
Curse
Vulnerabilities: Holy
Resistance: All attacks when invisible
This really is a sonic hedgehog look alike sort of a monster. These guys 
are invisible at first, and they are translucent. As they are invisible, 
all attacks can only take one HP off them when used. Therefore, it really 
can be very annoying at times. The Dark Hedgehog will tackle your character 
most of the time, resulting in no knockback at all. However, when the Dark 
Hedgehog starts showing off his acrobatic skills, you really should be 
prepared to run out of the way, as when it makes the whooshing sound and 
lands, the shock wave can stun you, and has a considerable area effect. 
Don't let them put a curse on you! Fortunately, these guys can be revealed 
by a Holy spell, once cast on them, they will become visible, and you can 
make them suffer for sure!

Griffin:
HP: 80
Attacks:
Airborne Jump Ballistic Attack
Ground Stomp Shock Wave Attack
Forward Wing Attack
Vulnerability: Fire
Useful Item: Griffin's Wing
This is just a giant bird that seems to be cross bred with a ground animal. 
Although this enemy is a bird, it cannot fly at all. Instead, it is grounded 
at all times. Most of the time, if you stand still and are far away from 
him, the Griffin will make a cry and then soar up into the air, and fire 
a single energy ball at you while airborne, before landing again. If you 
get close to the Griffin, he can attempt to charge you down by stomping 
the ground, creating a shockwave, or by simply hitting you with his wings. 
The former attack can stun you enemy, so be careful. A good idea would 
be to weaken him with a single Fire Spell. That way, you can hurt him more 
per hit. Once he is killed, he may drop his wing (Griffin's Wing), and 
you can take it with you, and use it to craft accessories.

Hedgehog Pie (First 2 Cycles only):
HP: 30
Attacks:
Charging Tackle
Acrobatic Ground Slamming Shock Wave Attack
Fire
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Lightning, Slow
Now, this is not a pie made from a hedgehog. It is actually another of 
those sonic the hedgehog look alike monsters. Hedgehog Pies are just the 
plain version of the Hedgehogs, with no resistance to anything. The 
Hedgehog Pie will tackle your character most of the time, resulting in 
no knockback at all. However, when the Hedgehog Pie starts showing off 
his acrobatic skills, you really should be prepared to run out of the way, 
as when it makes the whooshing sound and lands, the shock wave can stun 
you, and has a considerable area effect. Hedgehog Pies can also cast Fire 
in attempt to burn you. But still, there is a considerable delay before 
he releases the attack, so you will be safe. Use that time to run into 
it and start bashing it to death.

Stone Hedgehog (Cycle 2 onwards):
HP: 20
Attacks:
Charging Tackle
Acrobatic Ground Slamming Shock Wave Attack
Vulnerabilities: Gravity (once only)
Resistance: All spells
This really is a sonic hedgehog look alike sort of a monster. These guys 
are made of stone, and are really rock hard in the defense department. 
As they are rocky, all attacks can only take one HP off them when used. 
Therefore, it really can be very annoying at times. The Stone Hedgehog 
will tackle your character most of the time, resulting in no knockback 
at all. However, when the Stone Hedgehog starts showing off his acrobatic 
skills, you really should be prepared to run out of the way, as when it 
makes the whooshing sound and lands, the shock wave can stun you, and has 
a considerable area effect. Fortunately, these guys' HP can be halved by 
a single Gravity Spell, and then, you can just hit him 10 more times to 
kill them. What a job.

Mu:
HP: 25
Attacks:
Claw Swipe
Tail Whip
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Cold, Slow
These are just some squirrel that would barrow out of the ground to get 
at you. When you see dirt rising up from the ground and some cracking sound, 
you can tell that a Mu is coming out to annoy you. These guys are pretty 
much of an annoyance to your character. They will only swipe you with their 
claws, or sometimes will do a loop the loop and hit you with their tail. 
The Tail Whip in particular has a knock back force, and can stun your 
character. So, be careful of that. Otherwise, it won't be that troublesome 
to get rid of them at all, no spells are needed, just physical attacks.

Goblin Mage (Cycle 2 onwards):
HP: 30
Attacks:
Fire
Thunder
Blizzard
Blizzaga
Slow
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Lightning, Slow
These are the mages of the Goblin Army. They can be distinguished by their 
darker color and their magic staff. They are the artillery of the goblins. 
While you are busy fighting the enemies in the front, the Goblin Mage will 
simply target you from the rear and cause damage to you at that critical 
moment. The most threatening of his attacks are the Blizzaga. It has the 
same targeting ring as the Blizzard, and has a wider area effect. Therefore, 
whenever you notice your character standing on a targeting ring, move out 
of the way immediately, and the mage will miss. Once they are alone, Goblin 
Mages are pretty helpless. You can just run into the and kill them with 
ease at that point.

Goblin Chieftain:
HP: 60
Attacks: 
Blade Slash
Rock Throw
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Lightning, Slow
These are of the higher ranks of the Goblin Army. The Goblin Chieftains 
are larger and stronger than the normal Goblins, and they do more damage 
in their attacks. Besides, they usually cannot be knocked back by your 
attacks. Therefore, if you stats are low, you should hit and run to whittle 
down his health slowly and steadily. Otherwise, consider lowering their 
defense with Fire, or stunning them for a while with Thunder. The same 
rules of engagement apply for Goblin Chieftains as those to the standard 
issue Goblins.

---------------
Walkthrough
---------------
As soon as you get to play, you will find a sign in front of you. The path 
to the right is a scenic route, while the path to the left is the round 
about route. Turn right, you will find a raised bridge. There are two 
switches, place your Crystal Chalice on one while you step on the other. 
This side of the bridge will be lowered. Then, go back to the left and 
follow the path.

You will meet the first Goblins of the level. Kill them. The first holds 
gil, while the once behind him holds a plume of Phoenix Down. Take the 
Phoenix Down and equip it if necessary.

See that invisible ball like thing in front of you? That is a dark hedgehog. 
If you playing earlier cycles, he will not be there. But still, do not 
try to attack him, as you do not have Holy yet. Instead, turn to the right, 
to the river bank. There are 3 Goblins here, one with a dagger, one with 
a spear, and another one with a mace. That's the best of all 3 worlds! 
Kill them using hit and run tactics and pick up their stuff. There should 
be a Fire Magicite and a Blizzard Magicite, as well as money. Go to the 
area to the right, and there will be a treasure chest. Open it for a stone 
of Cure. Now, you can heal yourself whenever you wish. Go back to the left, 
to the bridge.

The bridge leads to the other side of the river, and that's where you have 
to go. Unfortunately, the gate of the bridge is locked, and there is a 
Goblin there. Kill him and he will drop a stone of Cure as well as a key. 
Pick up the key and place it on the pedestal. Then gate will then open, 
allowing your character to cross.

Get across the bridge. If you are playing on an earlier cycle, there should 
only be 2 Goblins here. If you are at a later cycle, you will encounter 
a Griffin as well. Kill these 3 enemies and pick up their stuff. The Griffin 
is holding an artifact, while another Goblin is holding a stone of Life, 
and the key to the gate to the north, while the final Goblin is holding 
a seed. There is a treasure chest to the right of the Goblin. Open it, 
and there may be a design for an Iron Belt. Keep it if you are a Selkie, 
otherwise, drop it and give it to a Selkie friend, or just destroy it.

Unlock the gate. Instead of going through, go south, and along the path 
by the river. You will end up at a Wind element Hotspot, guarded by a Stone 
Hedgehog (holding a Phoenix Down) and a Dark Hedgehog (holding a Stone 
of Cure). (They will not be there in earlier cycles) Kill both of them 
using Gravity and Holy and place the Crystal Chalice onto the hot spot. 
You now have the Wind Element. Keep it that way for the entire duration 
of the level. You will also find 2 switches to lower the other side of 
the bridge. Lower the bridge and you can leave easily if you like. (I doubt 
you will) Then, go to the right and run along the path. There will be a 
Goblin and a Goblin Mage in the way. Kill them and go on. You will reach 
a treasure chest guarded by a Mu and a Stone Hedgehog. Kill them and open 
the chest. There is another artifact inside. Go over and examine the 
northern cliff. There is a hole there. Enter it to find a Moogle House. 
You can just stamp your card and repaint Mog or whatever inside.

With the artifact in hand, go back to the gate and go through. There are 
3 Mus waiting for you in the ground. Kill them. One of them is holding 
a stone of Thunder. The others may hold money or food. You will reach a 
broken bridge, but do not cross yet. Instead, continue north and you will 
encounter a Mu, a Goblin Chieftain and more Goblins (along two paths). 
Kill them all and open the 2 Treasure Chests. The lower one may have a 
Design for a Mythril Sallet, keep it if you are a Yuke, the upper one may 
have a design for a valiant weapon. (Not worth it if you ask me, keep it 
if you like)

With these in hand, cross the broken bridge. See that chest to the north? 
It contains another stone of Life. Continue to the left, and you will 
encounter a Mu. Kill him for money as well as the key to the gate. You 
can go through the gate and kill all those Dark Hedgehogs and Goblins for 
their goodies if you like.

Then, go north to that big clearing there. There are lots of enemies. 
Including one Mu, 3 Griffins, 2 Goblins, 1 Goblin Mage and 1 Goblin 
Chieftain. The first Griffin holds an artifact, so does the Goblin 
Cheiftain. One of the Goblins holds another stone of Blizzard, while the 
Griffins may hold Griffin's Wings or maybe Flame Crafts. With them all 
dead, go northwest before crossing the bridge. There is a Treasure Chest. 
There may be a lightning craft there. Cross the bridge, and turn right 
for a Moogle House, and left for the boss, the Giant Crab. You will be 
fighting him in front of a waterfall.

--------------
Boss Battle
--------------
Boss: Giant Crab
HP: 400
Attacks:
Super Electric Discharge (When HP>266)
Claw Swipe (When HP>266)
Giant Horn Slam (When HP>133)
Slow Bubble
Thundara (When HP<133)
Thundaga (When HP<133)
Resistance: Lightning
Minions: 1 Mu
Item in Possession: Ancient Sword (~150 points)
Recommended Equipment: Wind Element Crystal Chalice, Thunder Badge
This boss looks a lot like a cross between a Triceratops and a crab. In 
fact, he has a single Mu to back him up. It will not be very hard for your 
character to kill the Mu, then you can focus on the Giant Crab. The Giant 
Crab has 3 appearance, one with the horn and claw, one with the horn, and 
one bare-headed. 

The first appearance applies when the Giant Crab has 266 or more HP left. 
He can use his claw to charge up electricity in his horn and fire at you, 
giving you an electric shock. He can also swipe you quite accurately with 
his claw. Therefore, do not run to the left of the direction the crab is 
facing or you will be hit and knocked down. The Giant Crab can blow out 
bubbles that will lock onto your character for a while. That way, you should 
run around until it stops following your character, or else, you will be 
slowed down. The Giant Crab can slam his horn down on you. This attack 
as more range than you can imagine. It is NOT a headbutt, as the Giant 
Crab will sort of fold his horn forwards. This also can have a knock back 
effect on your player, which is not very good.

Once the Giant Crab has 266HP left, he would lose his claw, and cannot 
discharge electricity or swipe you, but he can still slam you with his 
horns. Once you damage him to 133HP, he will lose his horn as well. This 
is when things get dangerous. As he has no physical attacks left, the Giant 
Crab will resort to using Thundara and Thundaga on you. These attacks have 
a large area effect, and can easily kill you if you are slowed down. 
Therefore, do not let him use the slow bubble on you at that stage. For 
additional safety, equip a Thunder Badge with a Wind Element in your Crystal 
Chalice, then, you will can prevent yourself from suffering from electric 
shocks, and you can bash the Giant Crab freely. Once his HP drops to zero, 
he will sort of melt down, and you can collect myrrh and receive a letter 
from your family. (If the myrrh tree is active)

*****2 PLAYER STRATEGY*****
When you have 2 players fighting against the Giant Crab, the thing can 
get much easier. After all, the Giant Crab's attacks are all one directional, 
as he only can swipe and ram the things immediately in front of him. So, 
use this to your advantage. Of the 2 players, the character with the 
stronger stats will slash like crazy in front of the Giant Crab to distract 
him, while the other one attacks from the side or from behind. Just let 
the stronger character take all the strain for the first two-thirds of 
the battle.

Once you have knocked the horn off the Giant Crab. Things will be much 
more serious. His Thundaga attack can easily knock out both of you at the 
same time, so you must make a sacrifice here. Run out of the crystal's 
aura just before he releases the attack and then run back in after it has 
been released. You will lose some health, but that is nothing compared 
to being shocked and unable to get up again. So, once he pauses, quickly 
run in and deliver a few hits, then run out again. Eventaully, you should 
be victorious, and can go and split the goodies later.

--------------
Artifact List
--------------
In the Item Selection Screen, you will be told the number of bonus points 
you received. You can choose from up to 8 artifacts or items, with the 
highest scoring player getting the first choice. If you get a high enough 
score of around 150, then you may get to keep the Ancient Sword stuck onto 
the Giant Crab as a little souvenir. This ancient sword can be sold for 
7500 gil, and can be used to forge the Ragnarok, which is the Dark Weapon 
of the Clavats. Therefore, keep it if you need it.

Note: The artifact marked with an asterisk (*) should be the winning 
chracter's first choice.

Set 1 (Buckler, Dragon's Whisker, Moogle Pocket*, Shuriken):

single player games, 160 for 2 player games, 180 for 3 player games and 
200 for 4 player games.

Now, you can go back to the World Map.

-------------------------
iii. Port Tipa [FFCC4A3]
-------------------------
Type of Area: Town

Port Tipa is just an empty port. You run down a twisted path down to the 
beach. On the way, there is a hole in the wall. Enter it to find a Moogle 
House.

On the beach, you can ask Stiltzskin the Moogle to offer some training 
to you. There is also a pier here, if you have met him in Jegon River, 
Tristan will offer rides to you on his boat for a fee. You can get to the 
East and West Banks of the Jegon River, then to Mt. Kilanda, and finally, 
to Leuda. Otherwise, there is nothing of interest in this tiny little port.

--------------------------
iv. Goblin Wall [FFCC4A4]
--------------------------
Type of Area: Level
Hot Spots Present: Fire, Earth

You will again be briefed by the woman, who herself is a caravanner. It 
seems that travelers used to be threatened by many monsters. However, brave 
Lilties purged the monsters, and most monsters were eradicated from the 
roads. However, they have overlooked some areas where monsters hide to 
bide their time. Goblin Wall is one such place, and the woman wonders if 
the world would ever be rid of all monsters. That's right, Goblin Wall 
is home to a wide range of monsters, which include all of the below.

-------------
Enemies
-------------
Goblin:
HP: 30, 37, 45
Attacks: 
Blade Slash (Blade Goblins only)
Spear Sweep (Goblin Spearmen only)
Mace Pound (Mace Wielding Goblins only)
Rock Throw (All Goblins)
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Lightning, Slow
The Goblins are the most common enemies found in the Goblin Wall, after 
all, this is the Goblin HQ! They have different weapons in hand. Some carry 
daggers, some carry spears and some carry maces. The goblins with daggers 
have 30 HP, the ones with spears have 37, and the ones with maces have 
45. The daggers cannot stun your character, but the spears and maces can. 
Be aware of the spears, as they have a wide sweeping angle. All rocks can 
stun your character, although they are not very accurate. In spite of the 
vulnerabilities they have, using normal physical attacks will do in this 
case.

Flan:
HP: 25
Attacks:
Headbutt
Yellow Slowness Gas (Slows you down)
Vulnerability: Fire
No, these are not those tasty pastries that are a lot like quiches. But, 
there are some blob of yellow goo that writhes like quicksilver on the 
ground. They are just another of those annoyances you will find in Goblin 
Wall. They attack by headbutting you with their goop. They also may attempt 
to slow you down by blowing some yellow gas out. Otherwise, you can just 
kill them with a couple of hits of your weapon. There is no need to use 
Fire at all, unless you want to waste your time.

Bat:
HP: 15
Attacks:
Headbutt
Vulnerability: All attacks when grounded
Resistance: All attacks when airborne
This is yet another pestilence in this level. Bats in this game flutter 
around, headbutting your characters as they go. If you attempt to hit them 
while they are flying, regardless of how hard you try, they can still only 
lose one HP per hit. However, it is another story if you have grounded 
them with gravity. Then, they will become much more vulnerable, and can 
be taken out with a couple of hits with you weapon. 

Goblin Mage:
HP: 30
Attacks:
Fire
Thunder
Blizzard
Blizzaga
Slow
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Lightning, Slow
These are the mages of the Goblin Army. They can be distinguished by their 
darker color and their magic staff. They are the artillery of the goblins. 
While you are busy fighting the enemies in the front, the Goblin Mage will 
simply target you from the rear and cause damage to you at that critical 
moment. The most threatening of his attacks are the Blizzaga. It has the 
same targeting ring as the Blizzard, and has a wider area effect. Therefore, 
whenever you notice your character standing on a targeting ring, move out 
of the way immediately, and the mage will miss. Once they are alone, Goblin 
Mages are pretty helpless. You can just run into the and kill them with 
ease at that point.

Goblin Chieftain:
HP: 60
Attacks: 
Blade Slash
Rock Throw
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Lightning, Slow
These are of the higher ranks of the Goblin Army. The Goblin Chieftains 
are larger and stronger than the normal Goblins, and they do more damage 
in their attacks. Besides, they usually cannot be knocked back by your 
attacks. Therefore, if you stats are low, you should hit and run to whittle 
down his health slowly and steadily. Otherwise, consider lowering their 
defense with Fire, or stunning them for a while with Thunder. The same 
rules of engagement apply for Goblin Chieftains as those to the standard 
issue Goblins.

Cerberus: (Later Cycles)
HP: 80
Attacks:
Claw Swipe
Claw Swipe with Energy Ball
Fire Blast (Burns)
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Slow, Paralysis
Useful Item: Cerberus Fang
No, these aren't those zombified hellhounds from the Resident Evil series. 
Instead, they are some sort of a large dog, with two tails and one head, 
instead of the three heads. These large enemies pack a punch. Most of the 
time, they will release a large energy ball with their claw swipe, that 
does great damage and at a range. If you are at close quarters, he will 
just swipe you, and this also deals a lot of damage to you. However, the 
Cerberus is particularly exposed when he performs his fire blast attack. 
Avoid the blast, and you can get a few hits in while he is blowing the 
fire out. It takes quite a long time for him to move again, and that's 
when you move in. Blizzard is also effective on him, and you can perform 
Blizzard or Thunder on him repeatedly to keep him immobile, although this 
can take some time if your magic stats are low. A Cerberus may drop a Cerberus 
Fang when he dies, and you can use it to forge a Valiant Weapon or the 
Lion's Heart accessory.

Ghost: (Later Cycles)
HP: 50
Attacks: 
Flap Bash
A one, and a two and a Ice Wave (Freezes)
Vulnerabilities: Holy
Resistance: All attacks when invisible, Cold
Useful Item: White Silk
Oh, what scary looking creatures you are. The ghosts of Final Fantasy 
Crystal Chronicles look like some flour sack with two red eyes, and two 
ribbon like flaps attached to the body. They also boost some powerful 
attacks. The Flap Bash is not that bad, but the Ice Wave is decimating. 
This must be the Ghost's close quarter defense. Whenever you see a Ghost 
pausing and moving their flaps up and down in a one, and a two and a three 
rhythm, get away from the ghost, as he will slam it down once more and 
release an Ice Wave which deals great damage and can freeze you in your 
own tracks. As they are invisible, they are so resistant that any hit will 
deal only one HP of damage to them. Therefore, you must reveal them with 
Holy, and then you can really make them pay for what they have done.

Electric Jellyfish:
HP: 30
Attacks:
Headbutt
Thunder
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Slow
Resistance: Lightning
Useful Item: Thunderball
This is just one of the silliest enemies that Square-Enix can think of, 
after all, what kind of Jellyfish can float in air and have electricity? 
The Electric Jellyfish are yet another annoying enemy in this level. They 
can float over and headbutt you, stunning you for a short time. When you 
are far away, they can cast Thunder on you. Besides, you cannot hit these 
pests directly, or you will get an electric shock. (Protect yourself with 
Wind Element or a Thunder Badge) I would therefore recommend using Blizzard 
or Fire on them, or just use Focus Attacks that are ballistic in nature. 
Electric Jellyfish tend to carry Thunderballs with them, and they can be 
used to forge Lightning Armor and Thunder Badges, which help your character 
to resist lightning based attacks.

---------------
Walkthrough
---------------
As soon as you start, go forward and take out that Goblin there. A flan 
will come at you from the right, kill him, and you can take his stone of 
Cure, allowing you to heal yourself whenever you wish. Then go to the right, 
there are a couple of bats here, as well as a Goblin and a Goblin Mage. 
Well, it really is rude of you to interrupt their supper. You should get 
a stone of Life from the Goblin Mage. Then, do not go through that opening 
there, instead, go all the way to the left, up the slope to face a Cerberus. 
See the treasure chests behind bars, to open the bars, use your weapon 
to hit the switches on the ledge above. There is also a Goblin (with Phoenix 
Down) with the Cerberus. Kill him as well. The two chests contain, from 
left to right, an artifact and maybe a Wisdom or Speed Secret.

Then go back up and up the slope. There is a Flan, a Goblin Mage and a 
Cerberus up there kill them and get their stuff. The mage holds a stone 
of Blizzard. Then go over to the left and kill the Goblin Chieftain, the 
Flan and the Bats. Open up all the bars blocking the chests. The uppermost 
chest has an artifact inside, and the lower chest may have a design for 
a valiant weapon. As for that passageway, unlock it and go inside. There 
is a hole there, which leads to a moogle house.

Then, you can go to the right of the slope. Kill the bats and the Goblin 
Chieftain, and the Flan (holding a seed). Trip the switch to open up the 
opening to the next area. Then skip the barred chest for the time being, 
go south to trip the switch to unbar the chest, revealing maybe a a design 
for a Flame Shield (Keep it if you are a Clavat) and go through the opening 
to the next area.

In the next area, we have Flans, coupled with several Ghosts. You know 
what to do to reveal those Ghosts. The Flan holds yet another stone of 
Cure, while you may find White Silk on the Ghosts, probably because that's 
what their bodies are made of. Then, move up the slope to engage the Electric 
Jellyfish and his fellow Ghosts. You should find a Stone of Clear on the 
Electric Jellyfish. Continue to go west here, ignoring all the barred 
chests until you reach the far end of this ledge, where you can find a 
Goblin Mage and a Goblin. Take them down so they cannot annoy you later.
	
Tip!
IF you have a s Blizzard Ring, you can combine it with two other stones 
of Blizzard to cast the Blizzaga spell in this level. Then, you can just 
cast it where you are now, and the enemies on the ledge above will all 
be killed, except for the ghosts. Repeat the casting until they all die. 
Use the scouter on the GBA to make sure that they all die.

Open up all the bars on the lower level. The chests contain, from right 
to left, an artifact, gil and more gil. Go through the revealed passage, 
and kill the Electric Jellyfish and the Ghost on the other side, also open 
up the passageway below. You can use that passage to return to the first 
area. Go down and kill all the Goblins there for more bonus points, if 
you wish. (There is a Goblin Spearman and a Mace Wielding Goblin by the 
Fire Hot Spot, one of them holds a plume of Phoenix Down.)

Then, go up the slope, you should find a Ghost, a Flan and an Electric 
Jellyfish with a plume of Phoenix Down, move right, opening up the bars 
below as you go. Continue to the right, and you will find a locked gate, 
with a Goblin, a Goblin Mage, a Goblin Chieftain and an Electric Jellyfish 
guarding it. Kill them all, get the key and unlock the gate. But don't 
go through it yet. Instead, continue to the right, kill the Goblin Spearman, 
Mace Wielding Goblin and Electric Jellyfish. Open the chest for another 
artifact.

There is still an extra area to be explored, as the tripping of the switches 
opened up a new passage. Go back to the unbarred chests and open them one 
by one. They may contain the following items, from left to right:
A design for a Master's Weapon, a design for a Holy Shield (keep it if 
you are a Clavat), a design for Holy Armor, a design for a Pure Belt (keep 
it if you are a Selkie), then you will find the passageway. Go through 
to the other side. Break through the Electric Jellyfish and Goblin and 
you will arrive at a switch, over the first area. Trip it to unbar the 
chest. Go back to the first area to open it. A design for a Mighty Weapon.

Then, you can go back to the unlock gate. Apparently, it leads to the boss. 
You have just broken into the Goblins' main control room of some sort. 
There is a lone Goblin King trying to cast some spells into a cauldron, 
when you came in. He turns back, sees you and doesn't like people sticking 
their noses into his affairs. Therefore, he shakes his fist and stamps 
his staff on the ground. 2 of his Goblin minions come out. The Goblin King 
points at you, ordering his minions to attack you. It is now battle time 
in the Goblin Central Arena!

---------------
Boss Battle
---------------
Boss: Goblin King
HP: 200
Attacks:
Firaga
Thundara
Blizzara
Poison Spell
Slowga
Staff Bash
Minions: 2 Goblins 
Useful Item: Cursed Crook (~198 points)
Recommended Equipment: Crystal Chalice with Earth Element and Blue Misanga, 
or Crystal Chalice with Fire Element with Flame Badge
It seems that the Goblin King has placed his trust on his personal 
bodyguards. In the beginning of the battle. You will fight his two dagger 
wielding Goblins. When they are down, two Goblin Spearmen will come out 
from 2 doors, to engage you. Kill them as usual. Each Goblin Spearman holds 
a key to the 2 pedestals there. Once they are dead, they will drop the 
keys, allowing you to pick them up, and place them onto the pedestals. 
Once both keys are in place, the steps to the platform where the Goblin 
King is will be revealed, allowing you to go up to fight the Goblin King 
man to man. He still will have 2 Goblin Spearman bodyguards to help him, 
but the Goblin King himself will attack.

The Goblin King has only 200 HP, which makes him rather easy to deal with. 
However, his spells do pack a punch, and will inflict a lot of nasty status 
ailments to your player. The particularly worse ones include poison and 
burning. As they are using level 2 spells, only 1 protective equipment 
is not enough, you will need to have 2 that protects against the same 
ailments, this is why I recommended the usage of Earth Element and Blue 
Misanga, which allows for double protection against poisoning, or the usage 
of Fire Element and Flame Badge at once.

It seems that the Goblin King's minions are not very bright. When you have 
killed them, they will reappear after a short time, but will still wait 
at their respective doors until you get close. Therefore, if you kill the 
two minions and then stay away from the doors while fighting the Goblin 
King, they will not come out to help their highness. Take this in mind.

The Goblin King uses a wide range of attacks, and Slowga, by far, is the 
hardest to annoy, but however, if you can keep a close distance between 
yourself and the Goblin King, things will be very easy for you, and he 
will just bash you with your weapon while he hits you with his staff, even 
if you are slowed down. 

The Goblin King is also a master of surprises. When things go too tough, 
he will just wimpishly teleport to another part of the room. He can 
sometimes do this continuously and it's quite annoying. Stop and wait for 
him to reappear. Then run after him and bash him again.

Eventually, his HP meter would have dropped down to zero, and he will notice 
that his magic staff is malfunctioning and watches it explode in his face!  
That's the end of yet another easy battle. So, the Myrrh Tree is found 
in a chamber behind this main room. Watch and be amazed as the myrrh drops 
right into the chalice, filling it up by another third. Then, a mail moogle 
will come and deliver the mail, and you know the rest.

*****2 PLAYER STRATEGY*****
With 2 players, this fight becomes as easy as pie. First, just let each 
of you take out the two Goblins to the left and right of your starting 
position. Try to race each other to see who gets his/her key first. Then 
place them on the pedestal, trying to be in sync with each other. Then 
wait for the gate to rise.

Once it has risen, march up to the Goblin King and take out his 2 henchmen, 
let one player take out one. Then, all that is left to do is some circle 
and hit technique. Just run around, and when he is trying to cast a spell, 
stay away from the targeting ring and start bashing him! He may try to 
teleport, but well, it won't be hard and continue the slugfest you will 
be having. As the increment of HP of the Goblin King is not large relative 
to your combined attacking power, I think this battle will last even shorter 
than when you have to fight against him in single player! Let's now go 
down to the Artifact List and see what loot we may share? Shall we?

---------------
Artifact List
---------------
You will yet again come across an item selection screen again. If you get 
a high score, say, at about 198 (This is what I got for once), you can 
get to salvage an item from the Goblin King, which is his Cursed Crook. 
The Cursed Crook can be used to forge the Ragnarok (The Clavats' Dark Weapon) 
or craft the Bishop's Soul (an accessory for the Yukes that increase their 
Magic Points by 3). Therefore, you should select that while you have the 
chance if you are a Clavat or Yuke. On the other hand, you may also get 
to choose an Artifact called the Galatyn. The Galatyn is a magic boosting 
artifact that increases the character's Magic by 7!

Set 1 (Double Axe, Earth Pendant*, Sparkling Bracer, Winged Cap):
This has got to be the easiest set for your character(s) to come across 
in Goblin Wall. Of course, it is unique to Cycle 1 only. Just do as badly 
as possible and this set will be up for grabs. You only have 1 chance to 
get this set. Remember.

Set 2 (Earth Pendant*, Kaiser Knuckles, Sparkling Bracer, Wonder Wand):
This is another set unique to Cycle 1, only that it is harder to get this 
time. To get it, you should get around 110 points for a single player game, 
120 points for a single player game, 140 points for a 3 player game and 
150 points for a 4 player game.

Set 3 (Ashura, Faerie Ring, Arai Helm, Moogle Pocket*):
This, for once, is a set that is common between Cycle 1 and Cycle 2. To 
get it in Cycle 1, get about 140 points in single player, 150 points for 
2 player games, 170 for 3 player games and 190 for 4 player games. Just 
do as badly as possible in Cycle 2 and this set should be yours for the 
taking.

Set 4 (Dark Matter, Fang Charm, Moogle Pocket*, Sparkling Bracer):
This is another artifact set common to Cycle 1 and Cycle 2. To get it in 
Cycle 1, get around 170 points in single player mode, 190 points in a2 
player game, 210 points in a 3 player game and around 230 points in a 4

game and 150 points for a 4 player game.

Set 5 (Arai Helm, Mjollnir*, Red Slippers):

140 points in single player, 150 points for 2 player games, 170 for 3 player 
games and 190 for 4 player games. Just do as badly as possible in Cycle 
3 and this set should be yours for the taking.

This is again common to Cycle 2 and Cycle 3. To get it in Cycle 2, get 
around 170 points in single player mode, 190 points in a 2 player game,

150 points for a 4 player game.

Set 7 (Candy Ring, Fang Charm, Wonder Bangle*):
This set is unique to Cycle 3. To get it, get about 140 points in single 
player, 150 points for 2 player games, 170 for 3 player games and 190 for 
4 player games.

Set 8 (Galatyn*, Green Beret, Sparkling Bracer):
This has got to be the set with the most powerful artifact, the Galatyn 
in Goblin Wall. It is of course unique to Cycle 3. To get it, get around 
170 points in single player mode, 190 points in a 2 player game, 210 points 
in a 3 player game and around 230 points in a 4 player game.

Well, I guess we can call it a day in this dingy dungeon and get back out 
to the World Map, for the next area. 

---------------
Miasma Stream
---------------
This is where you cross over to get to Iron Mine Downs. Make sure that 
your Crystal Chalice's element matches that of the stream. Otherwise, a 
powerful force field will knock your character back. Having crossed over 
the stream, you will arrive at Iron Mine Downs.

----------------------------
b. Iron Mine Downs [FFCC4B]
----------------------------
Iron Mine Downs is the second area that you are going to visit in your 
quest to collect myrrh. The Iron Mine Downs is so called because there 
used to be an Iron Mine in the area where the Lilties mined iron to make 
weapons and conquer the world. Now, the mine is abandoned. Anyway, there 
are 5 main areas to be found in this region, the Miasma Stream you came 
from, Mushroom Forest, Marr's Pass, Jegon River East Bank, Mine of 
Carthuages and the Miasma Stream to Vale of Alfataria. There are also 2 
road junctions, where you can meet other people.

-----------------------------
i. Mushroom Forest [FFCC4B1]
-----------------------------
Type of Area: Level
Hot Spots: Water

You will be briefed by the woman, before you get to play. It seems that 
when the woman was a child, she once asked her mother where she came from, 
but you know, all those procedures for having sex and giving birth to babies 
are too complex for the young girl that she was and her mother told her 
that she sprouted from the Mushroom Forest. Soon, nightmares haunted her 
sleep, she dreamt that she was lost among the toadstools. She woke up in 
tears, but felt the warmth of her mother's embrace, and this is something 
that she remembered until this day.

---------------
Enemies
---------------
Gremlin:
HP: 30
Attack:
Hair Ball Smack
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Slow, Paralysis
No, these are not those tiny little fuzzy creatures that cannot stand water. 
The Gremlin is a rather common enemy in Mushroom Forest, but they are not 
much of a threat still. Their only attack, the hair ball attack, does not 
deal too much damage but it has a knockback effect, so you will get stunned 
for a short moment when hit. Gremlins are vulnerable to cold, slow and 
paralysis, therefore, you can always use Blizzard or Thunder on them. Their 
hair ball attack can be spotted as he leans his head backwards. Then, you 
can move out of the way as it so slow and inaccurate. In spite of his 
vulnerabilities, a couple of hits from your weapon should be sufficient 
to kill there little pests.

Hell Plant:
HP: 30
Attack:
Energy Ball Spit
Poison Gas (Poisons)
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Slow, Paralysis
The Hell Plant is another common enemy found in Mushroom Forest, Tida, 
Conall Curach, and many other places. It's amazing that plants can make 
such cries. Most of the time, they attack from a range, by spitting out 
energy balls at you. They make a very distinguishable sound while doing 
so, therefore, it would not be very hard to anticipate and evade their 
attack. Most of the time, Hell Plants will use this attack. But sometimes, 
they can let out poison gas from their mouth which poisons you, of course. 
This attack is also easily detectable, as once they are preparing to unleash 
poison gas, they will always stop attacking for a moment and act as if 
they are holding their breath. You should get out of the way for the time 
being until their have finished releasing the gas. The Hell Plants are 
vulnerable to fire and lightning, but I don't think you will need spells 
to take these stationary enemies down.

Stone Plant (Cycle 2 onwards):
HP: 20
Attack:
Energy Ball Spit
Poison Gas (Poisons)
Vulnerability: Gravity (Only once)
Resistance: All attacks
The Stone Plant is basically a beefed up version of the Hell Plant. But 
still, why would plants be made of stone? I guess Square-Enix must have 
become rather too creative nowadays. Like the Hell Plants, the Stone Plants 
attack from a range, by spitting out energy balls at you. They make a very 
distinguishable sound while doing so, therefore, it would not be very hard 
to anticipate and evade their attack. But if it hits, it deals more damage 
than that of the Hell Plant. Most of the time, Stone Plants will use this 
attack. But sometimes, they can let out poison gas from their mouth which 
poisons you, of course. This attack is also easily detectable, as once 
they are preparing to unleash poison gas, they will always stop attacking 
for a moment and act as if they are holding their breath. You should get 
out of the way for the time being until their have finished releasing the 
gas. I know, Stone Plants are weak against gravity, so use it to sap half 
of its HP before you start to bash them.

Ahriman:
HP: 25
Attack:
Flying Tackle
Random Blue Beam (Slows you down)
Thunder
Vulnerability: Gravity
Resistance: All attacks when in the air
The Ahriman is a yellow colored flying enemy, with wings that resemble 
those of pteradactyls. There really is no head on these flying enemies. 
Instead, there is a body, with an eye in the middle. The Ahrimans usually 
will not attack you when you are far away from them. Instead, they will 
just randomly zap a blue beam around, that is so random that it is hard 
to avoid. If you get hit, you will not receive damage, only that you will 
be slowed down to a crawl. Sometimes, they may attempt to cast Thunder 
on you, but that is easy to avoid once you see the targeting ring on the 
ground. When you are up close, Ahrimans will just tackle you in the air. 
As he is flying, you should bring him down with Gravity to immobilize him, 
then feel free to slash him to death.

Ice Ahriman: (Multiplayer games only)
HP: 25
Attack:
Flying Tackle
Random Blue Beam (Slows you down)
Blizzard
Vulnerability: Gravity
Resistance: All attacks when in the air, Cold
Useful Item: Chilly Gel
The Ahriman is a green colored flying enemy, with wings that resemble those 
of pteradactyls. There really is no head on these flying enemies. Instead, 
there is a body, with an eye in the middle. The Ice Ahrimans, like the 
normal Ahrimans usually will not attack you when you are far away from 
them. Instead, they will just randomly zap a blue beam around, that is 
so random that it is hard to avoid. If you get hit, you will not receive 
damage, only that you will be slowed down to a crawl. Sometimes, they may 
attempt to cast Blizzard on you, but that is easy to avoid once you see 
the targeting ring on the ground. When you are up close, Ice Ahrimans will 
just tackle you in the air. As he is flying, you should bring him down 
with Gravity to immobilize him, then feel free to slash him to death. Once 
you beat him, an Ice Ahriman may drop Chilly Gel, which can be used to 
craft Frost Armor and Frost Badges.

Ochu (Cycle 2 onwards):
HP: 100
Attacks:
Double Vine Slam
Rapid Spin
Poison Spell (Poisons)
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Slow, Paralysis
Ochus are some sort of plant being with a big mouth and some pink petals 
around. These plant beings, unlike the Hell Plant, are not stationary, 
they can move around to wreck havoc on you. Their high HP makes them 
particularly troublesome. Fortunately these enemies do not have any decent 
ranged attacks. Ochus can only cast poison spells on you. Once you see 
the green targeting ring on the ground, move away and you will be safe 
from poisoning. However, do not let Ochus get too close to you. When you 
are close enough, Ochus can swing their long vine like arms out and slam 
you between them. Or, they can just be a bit aerobic and spin around, 
knocking you back. As Ochus are plants, they are particularly vulnerable 
to fire. So, casting a Fire spell on them to weaken them is not a bad idea 
at all. If in doubt, use projectile focus attacks to keep your distance 
from this oversized plant being.

Tiny Worm:
HP: 30
Attack:
Tackle
Vulnerability: Fire
Resistance: Lightning
Tiny worms are actually the young versions of the Carrion Worm. They are 
mainly green in colour and they make a hissing sound. These worms are small 
and usually cannot deal too much damage on you. They rely on running over 
to you and tackling you, and that is all. As they have such a low HP, killing 
them will not be a big difficulty for you. Tiny worms are vulnerable to 
fire, but are resistant to lightning, as their older version, the Carrior 
Worm can cast Thunder. Casting Fira is a good way to eliminate several 
Tiny Worms that are bunched up together at once. Let them burn.

Dark Hedgehog (Cycle 3 onwards):
HP: 37
Attacks:
Charging Tackle
Acrobatic Ground Slamming Shock Wave Attack
Curse
Vulnerabilities: Holy
Resistance: All attacks when invisible
This really is a sonic hedgehog look alike sort of a monster. These guys 
are invisible at first, and they are translucent. As they are invisible, 
all attacks can only take one HP off them when used. Therefore, it really 
can be very annoying at times. The Dark Hedgehog will tackle your character 
most of the time, resulting in no knockback at all. However, when the Dark 
Hedgehog starts showing off his acrobatic skills, you really should be 
prepared to run out of the way, as when it makes the whooshing sound and 
lands, the shock wave can stun you, and has a considerable area effect. 
Don't let them put a curse on you! Fortunately, these guys can be revealed 
by a Holy spell, once cast on them, they will become visible, and you can 
make them suffer for sure!

Carrion Worm (Cycle 3 onwards):
HP: 60
Attack:
Tackle
Poison Gas Slam (Poisons)
Thunder
Vulnerability: Fire
Resistance: Lightning
Useful Item: Worm Antenna
Carrion Worms are the adult version of the . They are mainly green in colour, 
with a reddish brown antenna and they make a hissing sound. These worms 
are small and usually cannot deal too much damage on you. They rely on 
running over to you and tackling you, and that is all. These guys are quite 
a challenge, as they have twice the amount of HP as the carrion worms. 
Carrion Worms can cast Thunder on you, as well as poisoning you with gas. 
You can tell they are preparing to let out the gas when they lean their 
body back. At that time, run back! Tiny worms are vulnerable to fire, but 
are resistant to lightning, as  the Carrior Worm can cast Thunder. Casting 
Fira is a good way to eliminate several Tiny Worms and Carrion Worms that 
are bunched up together at once. Let them burn. Exterminate them. By the 
way, Carrion Worms may leave their Worm Antenna for you to pick up. The 
Worm Antenna can be used to make Time Armor and Accurate Watches.

Stone Hedgehog (Cycle 3 onwards):
HP: 20
Attacks:
Charging Tackle
Acrobatic Ground Slamming Shock Wave Attack
Vulnerabilities: Gravity (once only)
Resistance: All spells
This really is a sonic hedgehog look alike sort of a monster. These guys 
are made of stone, and are really rock hard in the defense department. 
As they are rocky, all attacks can only take one HP off them when used. 
Therefore, it really can be very annoying at times. The Stone Hedgehog 
will tackle your character most of the time, resulting in no knockback 
at all. However, when the Stone Hedgehog starts showing off his acrobatic 
skills, you really should be prepared to run out of the way, as when it 
makes the whooshing sound and lands, the shock wave can stun you, and has 
a considerable area effect. Fortunately, these guys' HP can be halved by 
a single Gravity Spell, and then, you can just hit him 10 more times to 
kill them. What a job.

Hedgehog Pie:
HP: 30
Attacks:
Charging Tackle
Acrobatic Ground Slamming Shock Wave Attack
Fire
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Lightning, Slow
Now, this is not a pie made from a hedgehog. It is actually another of 
those sonic the hedgehog look alike monsters. Hedgehog Pies are just the 
plain version of the Hedgehogs, with no resistance to anything. The 
Hedgehog Pie will tackle your character most of the time, resulting in 
no knockback at all. However, when the Hedgehog Pie starts showing off 
his acrobatic skills, you really should be prepared to run out of the way, 
as when it makes the whooshing sound and lands, the shock wave can stun 
you, and has a considerable area effect. Hedgehog Pies can also cast Fire 
in attempt to burn you. But still, there is a considerable delay before 
he releases the attack, so you will be safe. Use that time to run into 
it and start bashing it to death.

Magic Plant:
HP: 30

The Magic Plant is a new type of Hell Plant. Hell Plants are bluish green 
in colour with brightly coloured "wings". It's amazing that plants can 
make such cries. Most of the time, they attack from a range, by spitting 
out energy balls at you. They make a very distinguishable sound while doing 
so, therefore, it would not be very hard to anticipate and evade their 
attack. Most of the time, Hell Plants will use this attack. However, the 
meat of this plant are its magic attacks. All magic attacks are given out 
in a very short delay, which means that by the time you see the targeting 
ring beneath your character's feet, it would be too later. Therefore, you 
must be fast on your feet and use hit and run tactics to outwit this super 
fast plant like creature.

---------------
Walkthrough
---------------
As soon as you begin, walk forwards and to the right. There is a single 
gremlin hanging around there. Destroy him and he will drop a plume of 
Phoenix Down. Take it. You may need it in the beginning of this level in 
order to survive. Then, go back to your starting point.

This time, turn to the left. You will come to a large clearing, and there 
is an Ahriman, a Hell Plant and a Gremlin (holding a stone of Blizzard) 
here. The Hell Plant and the Gremlin can be taken out easily, but the Ahriman 
will be tough, because you most likely do not have magicite rings, and 
hence you cannot cast Gravity on them, so, you will have to hit him with 
physical attacks, and this is tough and tedious, and is likely to have 
you killed in the middle of the fight, and that's what the phoenix down 
is fall. Once the Ahriman falls, he will drop a stone of Cure. Finally, 
you can heal your wounds. Now, go south and cross that mushroom bridge 
to the other side. (The path to the north leads to a dead end.)

Don't get too comfortable yet. Go to the left. There is a Hell Plant, 
supported by a Stone Plant, and if you are playing a 2-player game, there 
will be 2 stone plants helping the Hell Plant. At this point, you still 
should not have the required magicite to cast Gravity, therefore, you will 
have a hard time in hitting those Stone Plants. In fact, you will have 
to hit Stone Plants 20 times each! This is definitely not fun at all, and 
you will have to constantly weaving around to dodge those energy balls 
that they fling at you. The good thing is that the Hell Plant will drop 
a stone of Life, which can be used to revive your teammates or fuse with 
other magicites to form Slow and Holy.

Now, move north along the path. There is a Gremlin with a Hell Plant. Kill 
them both and grab the money. Still continue along the path. You will see 
a mushroom trampoline. Ignore it for now, instead continue to the right 
and then north. You will end up at a clearing, and there are 3 Treasure 
Chests, guarded by an Ochu and 3 Hell Plants. As a safety precaution, I 
would suggest you should let the Ochu see you and then run away. The Ochu 
will follow you. When the Ochu is far away from the Stone Plants, they 
cannot fire and help him. This is when you can have a fair 1 to 1 brawl 
with the Ochu. Once the Ochu is dead, you can go and kill the Stone Plants 
using hit and run tactics, as you still don't have Gravity yet. The 3 chests 
may contain, from left to right: a design for a Mythril Sallet (keep it 
if you are a Yuke), a Daemon Kit (keep it if you are a Clavat) and a design 
for a Holy Shield (keep it if you are a Clavat).

Go back to the trampoline and bounce up to the ledge above. You will end 
up in front of a Hell Plant and a Gremlin. Kill these two. There is a Tiny 
Worm coming from the left, and he is holding a stone of Thunder. Get the 
Thunder Stone and equip it. As you already have a stone of Blizzard, you 
can fuse the two to get Gravity. Now, go over to the trampoline to the 
right and bounce up to the right.

You will run into another Ahriman. Use you newly made Gravity to ground 
him, and slash him to death. The chest to his left has a single artifact. 
There is a gremlin to the south. Kill him and follow the path to the south, 
to a Water Hot Spot. Change the element to Water. Then go right, to a clearing. 
There is a trampoline there, but do not get onto it, as it will only bring 
you back to the start of the level. Continue to the right, and you will 
find a Hell Plant (carrying a stone of Fire) with a Dark Hedgehog. Use 
Holy to reveal the Dark Hedgehog and kill the two. The Dark Hedgehog may 
hold a Fiend Kit, keep it if you are a Yuke.

Then go south. There is yet another Hell Plant and a Gremlin down there 
waiting for you. Kill him, as always. Go to the right. You are now at a 
clearing. There is a Tiny Worm (holding a stone of Thunder) and an Ochu 
here. Kill the two, and open the treasure chest. It contains an artifact. 
Then, go south and across the small bridge. You will run into a couple 
of Tiny Worms, as well as 2 Carrion Worms. Kill them as always, and try 
not to let the Carrion Worm poison you. There is a chest that contains 
a Fiend Kit, but you don't need it if you already have one. Do not get 
onto the trampoline. Instead, return to the clearing and continue to the 
right.

Well, what do you know? A Hell Plant and a Stone Hedgehog are there. Kill 
them as always. The Hell Plant will drop a stone of Clear. Then, you will 
find a Arhiman with a stone of Life as well as another Stone Hedgehog. 
Then, a Hell Plant with a plume of Phoenix Down. After that, you will meet 
a Hedgehog Pie and another Hell Plant! The Plant may hold the design for 
Mythril Gloves, keep it if you are a Lilty. Continue to go west along the 
path. 

See the trampoline? Bounce up for a treasure chest with another artifact, 
or it maybe empty. Examine the toadstools to the right of the chest and 
you can find an entrance to a moogle house. Enter and relax for a while, 
and stamp your card.

There is another Hell Plant supported by a Dark Hedgehog. This is getting 
tiring, with all these monsters in the way. The two may hold a seed and 
a Fiend Kit. Then, more action, there is a gremlin that may have a design 
of a Mythril Belt, keep it if you are a Selkie. Then go north, you are 
now getting closer to the boss. There is an Ochu and two Hell Plants guarding 
the entrance to the boss' lair. Kill the Hell Plants, they may have designs 
for Holy Armor and a Master's Weapon. Then, go through the opening to find 
the boss of this level. The Malboro.

You enter the clearing, and see some small pant like creature with many 
eyes. Suddenly the creature absorbs energy from the nearby toadstools and 
grows 10000 times bigger, scaring your character away. It's time to fight!

---------------
Boss Battle
---------------
Boss: Malboro
HP: 400
Attacks:
Ground Vine Attack
Poison Gas
Curse
Slowga
Blizzaga (When HP<200)
Resistance: Cold
Minions: 2 Magic Plants, 1 Hell Plant
Useful Item: Malboro Seed (~189 points)
Recommended Equipment: Crystal Chalice with Water Element, Frost Badge
You are now up against some large plant with more than 20 eyes and such 
a large mouth. The Malboro is a big stationary enemy, which means he cannot 
go after you even if you decide to run away. His 3 minions are just as 
stationary, and they do not have much range to pit against you. However, 
they really are an annoyance when you have to go in close to fight the 
Malboro. Particularly when you notice that there is a targeting ring where 
you are standing, and by the time you realize it, it is often too late 
and the spell is cast on you. This is particularly true for all those Magic 
Plants around. They have a lot of tricks that really are annoying.

Therefore, the best course of action may be to kill the 3 plants helping 
the Malboro while constantly avoiding the Malboro's attacks. As it is the 
case of 4 against one, I would recommend you to hit and run if your stats 
are low. That is, hit this Magic Plant once, then run, hit the Hell Plant, 
run, hit the other Magic Plant. Repeat the procedures until they are all 
dead. Then you can move in to hit the Malboro before the plants reappear.

The Malboro himself has a much longer range than the Magic Plants and Hell 
Plants. When you are very far away from the Malboro, he can perform a Ground 
Vine Attack that can deal multiple hits on your character. You can tell 
when the Malboro is raising his tentacle above the ground, ready to slam 
down. Once slammed down, some spiky vines will stick out of the ground 
where your character is standing, and can hit him/her hard. Therefore, 
whenever you see Malboro raising his tentacle, be prepared to run away 
from where you are standing.

Another thing to be aware of is the Curse spell, which will half all your 
character's stats. The curse spell here is denoted by a deep purple 
targeting ring, and this has a wider radius than the standard one. This 
also has an unlimited range, which means he can hit you with this spell 
regardless of anywhere you are standing. This move, compounded with the 
Ground Vine Attack can prove to be super deadly. Therefore, if you are 
cursed, be ready to cast Clear on yourself, or it may be possible for the 
Malboro to finish you off with just one Ground Vine Attack!

Now, when you are familiar with his attacks, go up close to the Malboro. 
The Malboro will again attempt to hit you with the Ground Vine Attack. 
Otherwise, if you see the targeting ring for Slow, I would suggest you 
run all the way back, as the Malboro will use Slowga, which can slow you 
down and has a wide radius. It will not be funny if you are too slow to 
avoid all the attacks he throws at you, particularly when he has less than 
200 HP.

Another attack of the Malboro is the Poison Gas Attack. He will take a 
deep breath, and blow a large cloud of green poison gas out which can poison 
you. As his mouth is so wide, it will not be possible for your character 
to run to the side of the gas. Therefore, run back again. This move is 
easily detectable. You will see the Malboro spinning his head round and 
round with some green clouds in his mouth before spitting the gas out. 
Therefore, run as soon as you see it.

The Malboro, like the Giant Crab, has a desperation move that can be used 
once his HP drops below half of the total, that is, 200. This time, the 
Malboro will cast Blizzaga, the ultimate Blizzard move on you. This move 
has just a very large radius. Fortunately, it lacks range. Whenever you 
see a light blue target ring in conjunction with the Malboro looking at 
the ground, then you can know that he is about to cast Blizzaga onto you. 
Then RUN like mad! Otherwise, you will find yourself to be frozen solid 
and butchered! To protect yourself, you will need double protection from 
Cold, and hence I would recommend equipping a Frost Badge or Frost Armor 
in conjunction with the Water Element in the Crystal Chalice.

The boss battle arena here in the clearing provides you with a slight 
tactical advantage, particularly when you would like to heal yourself. 
See those 2 large toadstools at the far back of the stage? Whenever you 
are behind them, nothing can hit you, with the exception of the Ground 
Vine Attack and the Curse. Therefore, you can always hide behind them for 
the time being to heal yourself. But do not stay too long, or the Malboro 
can sneak a few vines up and hurt you bad.

Finally, the Malboro can attempt to draw you into him by some gusts of 
wind. Use that to your advantage, as the Malboro cannot attack nor damage 
you with this wind, and you can deal a couple of free hits while you are 
at it. See?

After some fighting, the Malboro will finally be defeated, and he will 
sort of shrink back to his original size and melt away, and you can get 
a drop of myrrh from the tree behind the remains of the malboro. Get your 
mail, and offer a proper response to increase your family relationships.

*****2 PLAYER STRATEGY*****
If you are playing the game with 2 players, I would suggest the twin wing 
strategy here. Now, look at the position of the Malboro. He is a very wide 
boss, and he is completely blocking the road ahead. So, there is definitely 
no way you can slip behind the Malboro to catch him from behind. So, let's 
attack from 2 wings instead. First off, both of you should advance and 
take out each of the plants in the way. Have both players focus on one 
plant at a time to speed up. Then when they are all dead, place the crystal 
chalice on the ground so that it is right in the enter of the path.

Now, have one player attack the Malboro from the left and one from the 
right. Then, it will not be possible for the Malboro to attack both at 
the same time, at least until he is half damaged or more. Don't be 
discouraged even if he casts Slowga on both of you, as it won't affect 
the speed of your hits. If one is injured, just Cure him/her. Once Malboro 
has less than 50%, he will start using Blizzaga, and this is still deadly 
to 2 people that are standing apart. So, RUN! Don't worry about losing 
health due to the miasma. Just have one player continuously cast Cure so 
that you will not be killed. Then run back and continue your work. How 
about some Malboro sandwich!

Now, with the myrrh in your chalice, you can get out.

--------------------------
ii. Marr's Pass [FFCC4B2]
--------------------------
Type of Area: Town
Number of Blacksmiths: 2

Crystal Caravan: Lyne Dott, Leuts Royce, Rolf Wood
The Crystal Caravan of Marr's Pass has 3 members, 2 men and 1 woman. They 
are all Lilties. These people like to fight monsters, and will go after 
some on purpose, to get the stuff they have been carrying. Whenever you 
meet them in the road, they may tell you what certain monsters will be 
holding. On the other hand, you may sometimes encounter them when they 
are resting after a tiring day fighting monsters, and they will give you 
a present, which can either be a spoil from an enemy they have killed, 
or maybe a Marr's Sword, Spear, Racket or Hammer, depending on which tribe 
you are from. That weapon always has 22 strength.

Now, Marr's Pass is situated in an important road junction in Iron Mine 
Downs. You go west for the Jegon River, East for the Mine of Carthages. 
The Marr's Pass is also an important blacksmith center. There are a total 
of 2 Blacksmiths in business. There is a Lilty Blacksmith, to the right 
called Nat Dennim, who can craft any weapon you give him. There is also 
a Clavat blacksmith to the left called Arneaux, who specializes in forging 
conventional armor. The Weapon and Conventional Armor Lists will be given 
later. Whenever there is some scroll that cannot be crafted, you can have 
either of these two people forge the item. If neither can forge the armor, 
you should refer to another blacksmith in Alfataria, who will be introduced 
later in this guide.

There is also a moogle house in Marr's Pass. You can find it to the south 
of Arneaux's place. There is a flight of steps leading down to the house. 
You can then go in and have the Moogle inside stamp your mog card.

------------------------------------------------
iii. Nat Dennim the Weapon Blacksmith [FFCC4B3] 
------------------------------------------------
This is the one and only blacksmith that can forge weapons for you in the 
game, aside from one of your character's father. All weapons, no matter 
what they are can be crafted. Now, I will list out all the weapons for 
all 4 tribes that can be crafted here. Only the weapons I consider 
worthwhile to craft will be listed. For your information.

Design: Novice's Weapon
Weapon: Iron Sword (Clavat), Partisan (Lilty), Wave Hammer (Yuke), Solid 
Racket (Selkie)
Materials: Iron x1, 100 gil
Strength: 20

Design: Warrior's Weapon
Weapon: Steel Blade (Clavat), Sonic Lance (Lilty), Rune Hammer (Yuke), 
Dual Shooter (Selkie)
Materials: Iron x1, Alloy x1, 300 gil
Strength: 25
All Warrior's weapons give your character 25 strength. The Clavats can 
bash the enemy, where he lunges in and digs in two hits on the poor enemy. 
The Lilties can simply charge forward, and skewer anything that gets in 
their charge. The Yukes will lunge forward and perform a shockwave on the 
enemy. The Selkie's focus attack is definitely the best, as the user will 
fire two energy blasts at the enemies, hence it is called the dual blast.

Then, you should upgrade to the Master's Weapon.

Design: Master's Weapon
Weapon: Rune Blade (Clavat), Dragon Lance (Lilty), Mythril Hammer (Yuke), 
Butterfly Head (Selkie)
Materials: Mythril x1, Alloy x1, 700 gil
Strength: 30
The Clavats this time have a ballistic focus attack called the Soulshot, 
where they can fire a tiny ball of energy at the enemy. The Lilties get 
the Pulse Thrust, it's just another of those charging attacks. The Yukes 
get the shock bomb again, and the Selkies get the Power Kick, where they 
will jump out and kick the enemy.

Design: Victorious Weapon
Weapon: Defender (Clavat), Highwind (Lilty), Prism Hammer (Yuke), Prism 
Bludgeon (Selkie)
Materials: Iron x2, Ogre Fang x1, 500 gil
Strength: 31

Design: Valiant Weapon
Weapon: Feather Saber (Clavat), Titan Lance (Lilty), Goblin Hammer (Yuke), 
Elemental Cudgel (Selkie)
Materials: Bronze x3, Cerberus Fang x1, 500 gil
Strength: 31

Design: Mighty Weapon
Weapon: Bastard Sword (Clavat), Halberd (Lilty), Sonic Hammer (Yuke), 
Steel Cudgel (Selkie)
Materials: Iron x2, Jagged Scythe x1, 500 gil
Strength: 32

Design: Greatest Weapon
Weapon: Ultima Sword (Clavat), Ultima Lance (Lilty), Ultima Hammer (Yuke), 
Ultima Maul (Selkie)
Materials: Ultimite x1, Orichalcum x1
Strength: 35

Design: Legendary Weapon
Weapon: Excalibur (Clavat), Gungnir (Lilty), Goblin Hammer (Yuke), 
Queen's Heel (Selkie)
Materials: Orichalcum x1, Alloy x1, Ancient Potion x1, 2500 gil
Strength: 33 for Excalibur and Queen's Heel, 35 for Gungnir and Goblin 
Hammer
The Legendary Weapon can be found in the item selection screen after you 
beat a boss. The same goes for Orichalcum and Ancient Potion. This is the 
only way to get those items if you do not want to go to Lynari Desert, 
Conall Curach and other difficult levels. Once you have it, you already 
would have the most powerful or the second most powerful weapon, in terms 
of strength of your tribe. The Clavats have the Soulshot as the Focus Attack, 
and they can fire a very large energy ball at the enemy. The Lilties have 
the Cross Slash, and they will charge into the enemy and hit them twice. 
The Yukes have the Magic Bomb, which is another shock wave, and the Selkies 
get the Power Kick again. Once you have it, you don't need to worry about 
the Greatest Weapon, as there is nothing so great about the Greatest Weapon, 
except it is expensive. After all, all Greatest Weapons have a Strength 
of only 33 or 35.

Clavats, Lilties and the Selkies on the other hand, can do even better 
than the Legendary Weapon. The Lilties have the Celestial Weapon, and the 
Selkies have the Lunar Weapon. Clavats have the Dark Weapon. They are really 
powerful. Both can only be obtained in the item selection screen after 
you defeat the boss of a level.

Design: Celestial Weapon (Lilty)
Weapon: Longinus
Materials: Red Eye, Dragon's Fang, Orichalcum x2, 8000 gil
Strength: 40
Focus Attack: Bladestorm
I don't possess this weapon yet, so I really cannot say anything about 
this weapon. However, someone with the pseudonym DragonQuest gave me an 
e-mail, telling me what the Longinus is like, and here it is.

Submitter's Tip! DragonQuest's Tip
Well after a bit more work to get the Dragon's Fang.  I finally was able 
to forge the Longinus from the Marr's Pass Blacksmith.  It was definitely 
a major improvement from the previous weapons but not anything 
gamebreaking.  The Longinus's focus attack is a 5-hit combo that is 
stopable if you get hit. Once the combo begins, you can't stop it unless 
you get hit or it finishes.  It seems as if it just hits 5 times and nothing 
more.  The hits don't appear to be any stronger than regular hits.  I guess 
it wasn't as disappointing as the force ring though.

Design: Lunar Weapon (Selkie)
Weapon: Dreamcatcher
Materials: Orichalcum, Wind Crystal, Desert Fang, 5000 gil
Strength: 35
Focus Attack: Meteor Blast
The Dreamcatcher is the mightiest weapon that a Selkie can wield. This 
can be proved by the Focus Attack. The Focus Attack, Meteor Blast will 
send a meteor from the sky onto the ground. This is similar to the Meteor 
Strike move of the Fire Bomb, and has just the same area effect! Now, just 
wait for the enemies to group together, and destruction guaranteed! There 
is one catch, just one catch. It is that you will have to lose half a heart 
whenever you use the Meteor Blast. But still, if you hold a Jade Bracer 
or Healing Headband while you are using it, the effects should not be felt.

Design: Dark Weapon (Clavat)
Weapon: Ragnarok
Materials: Cursed Crook x1, Ancient Sword x1, Orichalum x1, 5000gil
Strength: 35
Focus Attack: Shadowblade
I have finally found the design for this weapon. The design is obtained 
when you beat Rebena Te Ra with about 177 bonus points. The Ragnarok 
requires two spoils from the bosses, both of which are easily found, as 
they are in Tipa Peninsula. The Ancient Sword is ofund on the Giant Crab, 
while the Cursed Crook is found on the Goblin King. The Ragnarok has a 
very powerful focus attack called the Shadow Blade. The character will 
charge forward, and hit his/her target 3 times in quick sucession. The 
only drawback is that it does not have a long range, and the player will 
lose half a heart every time he/she uses it.

---------------------------------------------------------
iv. Arneaux the Conventional Armor Blacksmith [FFCC4B4]
---------------------------------------------------------
Arneaux is a Clavatian Blacksmith that is best at forging armor in this 
game. He can forge all conventional armor and shields, regardless of what 
materials are needed. However, he cannot forge weapons that protect you 
from status ailments nor those that can boost your attributes other than 
your defense. Here is the list of things that he can make.

*****ARMOR*****
As for Armor, I suggest you start upgrading with Iron Armor.

Design: Iron Armor
Armor: Iron Plate
Materials: Iron x1, 200 gil
Defense: 17
This is just the first conventional armor upgrade your character can come 
across in this game. This is a bit too medieval really. After all, the 
blacksmiths later should be able to make steel by heating Iron in a Blast 
Furnace. However, Iron Armor is much better than the travel clothes that 
you may appear to be wearing.

Then, upgrade to Mythril Armor.

Design: Mythril Armor
Armor: Mythril Haub.
Materials: Mythril x1, 500 gil
Defense: 22
Mythril Armor is a substantial improvement to the Iron Armor, with an 
increment of 5 from the Iron Armor. Mythril appears in an octahedral from, 
similar to the way Iron and Bronze appear in the map. However, Mythril 
is blue in colour. Although Mythril is available in shops, I would not 
recommend buying Mythril, as it is very expensive, at 5000 gil a chunk. 
Instead, you can kill relatively strong enemies and they may hold Mythril. 
It is very common indeed.

The ultimate armor for all 4 tribes but 1 is the Diamond Armor. You can 
get it from the Item Selection Screen after you beat the boss. Otherwise, 
you can look for the design in later levels.

Design: Diamond Armor
Armor: Diamond Plate
Materials: Orichalcum x1, Hard Shell x1, Diamond Ore x1, 2500 gil
Defense: 27
Wow, this is one thing that I have never seen before. Armor made from Diamond! 
As diamonds are basically the hardest substance ever to be found on earth, 
I really would be surprised to find blacksmiths in this game having the 
technology to craft such strong armor. As it is so hard, you get another 
5 point increment in defense over the Mythril Armor, and you would prove 
a tough nut to crack when you are wearing it. (Say, isn't diamond a little 
bit heavy?) Of course, you cannot just make armor with diamonds alone, 
in addition to Diamond Ore, you will need a chunk of Orichalcum, which 
appears as yellow tetrahedrals in the playing field. Orichalcum cannot 
be bought, but can be found in the hands of many strong enemies like the 
Behemoths and Zus in harder levels of the game. If you would not bother 
to kill those monsters, you will just have to wait for the item to appear 
for selection in the Item Selection Screen. The Hard Shell is found on 
Blazer Beetles, which are not hard to kill.

For the Clavats, it does not stop here. They also can get the Earth Armor 
design, found in the Item Selection screen.

Design: Earth Armor (Clavat)
Armor: Gaia Plate
Materials: Lord's Robe, King's Scale, Orichalcum x2, 5000 gil
Defense: 30
This is the ultimate armor of Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles. From the 
manual, you will find that Clavats are specializing in defense, and the 
presence of this unique armor is there to prove it. With 2 chunks of the 
rare Orichalcum, the Lord's Robe of the Gigas Lord of the Moschet Manor, 
the King's Scale of the Lizardman King of the Daemon Court, you get the 
finest materials from all over the world to produce the Gaia Plate. Finding 
the design for this armor is another story. To find it, you must beat a 
boss with a high score and hope that it will be up for grabs in the Item 
Selection Screen. Then, you will have to beat the Gigas Lord and Lizard 
Man King with high scores and hope that you get to salvage them in the 
selection screen. All this effort will pay back in the air. Just don't 
lose heart, all you Clavat players out there!

*****SHIELDS FOR CLAVATS*****
Design: Iron Shield
Shield: Iron Shield
Materials: Iron x1, 150 gil
Defense: 10
This is just the first conventional shield upgrade your Clavat can come 
across in this game. This is a bit too medieval really. After all, the 
blacksmiths later should be able to make steel by heating Iron in a Blast 
Furnace. However, the Iron Shield is much better than the makeshift shield 
(Fake Shield, a forgery!) that you may appear to be wearing.

Design: Mythril Shield
Shield: Mythril Shield
Materials: Mythril x1, 400 gil
Defense: 15
The Mythril Shield is a substantial improvement to the Iron Shield, with 
an increment of 5 from the Iron Shield. Mythril appears in an octahedral 
from, similar to the way Iron and Bronze appear in the map. However, Mythril 
is blue in colour. Although Mythril is available in shops, I would not 
recommend buying Mythril, as it is very expensive, at 5000 gil a chunk. 
Instead, you can kill relatively strong enemies and they may hold Mythril. 
It is very common indeed.

Design: Diamond Shield
Shield: Diamond Shield
Materials: Orichalcum x1, Diamond Ore x1, 2000 gil
Defense: 22
Wow, this is one thing that I have never seen before. A Shield made from 
Diamond! As diamonds are basically the hardest substance ever to be found 
on earth, I really would be surprised to find blacksmiths in this game 
having the technology to craft such strong armor. As it is so hard, you 
get another 5 point increment in defense over the Mythril Shield, and you 
would prove a tough nut to crack when you are wearing it. (Say, isn't diamond 
a little bit heavy, it is amazing that the poor Clavat won't be weighed 
down with such a heavy shield strapped to his left arm) Of course, you 
cannot just make shields with diamonds alone, in addition to Diamond Ore, 
you will need a chunk of Orichalcum, which appears as yellow tetrahedrals 
in the playing field. Orichalcum cannot be bought, but can be found in 
the hands of many strong enemies like the Behemoths and Zus in harder levels 
of the game. If you would not bother to kill those monsters, you will just 
have to wait for the item to appear for selection in the Item Selection 
Screen. Unlike the Diamond Armor, you do not need a Hard Shell.

The Clavats get to use the Legendary Shield design exclusively, found in 
the Item Selection Screen as well. At least, that is how I got the design. 
This gives the Clavats another 3 point lead over the other tribesmen in 
the Defense department.

Design: Legendary Shield
Armor: Chocobo Shield
Materials: Orichalcum x2, Yellow Feather x1, 3000gil
Defense 25
This is the ultimate shield of the game. This is here to prove to the players 
that the Clavats really are specializing in defense. In fact, when this 
shield is equipped in conjunction of the Gaia Plate, the Clavats get to 
have a 6 point lead in the defense department over the other tribes are 
stuck with diamond defenses. The Chocobo Shield is a shield with the 
inscription of the legendary bird, the Chocobo. It is gold in colour, and 
I guess it should be lighter than the Diamond Shield. Tee hee. This time, 
if you want to craft the Legendary Shield for your Clavat, you must find 
two chunks of Orichalcum, instead of one, and that is not a difficult task 
if you can visit places like Conall Curach or the Lynari Desert, as there 
are multiple enemies with chunks of Orichalcum. However, you must be very 
careful, as Behemoths and Zus are very tough. As for the Yellow Feather, 
I guess it is there for decorative purposes, as the Chocobo is a bird. 
A Yellow Feather can be found in the hands of a Tonberry Chef in the Moschet 
Manor. I am sure that at least one of them will hold a feather.

*****GAUNTLETS FOR LILTIES*****
Design: Bronze Gloves
Gauntlets: Bronze Gauntlets
Materials: Bronze x1, 80 gil
Defense: 8
This is a small and weak upgrade for your Lilty. It is so cheap and useless 
that I suggest you save up for a pair of Iron Gauntlets instead. That 80 
gil can be used for other constructive purposes.

Design: Iron Gloves
Gauntlets: Iron Gauntlets
Materials: Iron x1, 150 gil
Defense: 12
This is just the first real conventional gauntlet upgrade your Lilty can 
come across in this game. This is a bit too medieval really. After all, 
the blacksmiths later should be able to make steel by heating Iron in a 
Blast Furnace. However, the Iron Shield is much better than the Gauntlets 
(Plain, must be made of leather) that you may appear to be wearing.

Design: Mythril Gloves
Gauntlets: Mythril Gauntlets
Materials: Mythril x1, 400 gil
Defense: 15
The Mythril Gauntlets are a substantial improvement to the Iron Gauntlets, 
with an increment of 3 from the Iron Gauntlets. Mythril appears in an 
octahedral from, similar to the way Iron and Bronze appear in the map. 
However, Mythril is blue in colour. Although Mythril is available in shops, 
I would not recommend buying Mythril, as it is very expensive, at 5000 
gil a chunk. Instead, you can kill relatively strong enemies and they may 
hold Mythril. It is very common indeed.

Design: Diamond Gloves
Shield: Diamond Armlets
Materials: Orichalcum x1, Diamond Ore x1, 2000 gil
Defense: 22
Wow, this is one thing that I have never seen before. A pair of Armlets 
made from Diamond! As diamonds are basically the hardest substance ever 
to be found on earth, I really would be surprised to find blacksmiths in 
this game having the technology to craft such strong armor. As it is so 
hard, you get another 5 point increment in defense over the Mythril 
Gauntlets, and you would prove a tough nut to crack when you are wearing 
it. (Say, isn't diamond a little bit heavy, it is amazing that the poor 
Lilty won't be weighed down if they have to wear such heavy armlets on 
both of their tiny hands) Of course, you cannot just make armlets with 
diamonds alone, in addition to Diamond Ore, you will need a chunk of 
Orichalcum, which appears as yellow tetrahedrals in the playing field. 
Orichalcum cannot be bought, but can be found in the hands of many strong 
enemies like the Behemoths and Zus in harder levels of the game. If you 
would not bother to kill those monsters, you will just have to wait for 
the item to appear for selection in the Item Selection Screen. Unlike the 
Diamond Armor, you do not need a Hard Shell.

*****HELMS FOR YUKES*****
Design: Bronze Sallet
Gauntlets: Bronze Helm
Materials: Bronze x1, 80 gil
Defense: 8
This is a small and weak upgrade for your Yuke. It is so cheap and useless 
that I suggest you save up for an Iron Helm instead. That 80 gil can be 
used for other constructive purposes.

Design: Iron Sallet
Gauntlets: Iron Helm
Materials: Iron x1, 150 gil
Defense: 12
This is just the first real conventional Helm upgrade your Yuke can come 
across in this game. This is a bit too medieval really. After all, the 
blacksmiths later should be able to make steel by heating Iron in a Blast 
Furnace. However, the Iron Helm is much better than the Helm (Plain, must 
be made of an old teapot or something) that you may appear to be wearing.

Design: Mythril Sallet
Gauntlets: Mythril Helm
Materials: Mythril x1, 400 gil
Defense: 15
The Mythril Gauntlets are a substantial improvement to the Iron Helm, with 
an increment of 3 from the Iron Helm. Mythril appears in an octahedral 
from, similar to the way Iron and Bronze appear in the map. However, Mythril 
is blue in colour. Although Mythril is available in shops, I would not 
recommend buying Mythril, as it is very expensive, at 5000 gil a chunk. 
Instead, you can kill relatively strong enemies and they may hold Mythril. 
It is very common indeed.

Design: Diamond Sallet
Shield: Diamond Helm
Materials: Orichalcum x1, Diamond Ore x1, 2000 gil
Defense: 22
Wow, this is one thing that I have never seen before. A Helm made from 
Diamond! As diamonds are basically the hardest substance ever to be found 
on earth, I really would be surprised to find blacksmiths in this game 
having the technology to craft such strong armor. As it is so hard, you 
get another 5 point increment in defense over the Mythril Helm, and you 
would prove a tough nut to crack when you are wearing it. (Say, isn't diamond 
a little bit heavy, it is amazing that the poor Yuke won't be weighed down 
if they have to wear such heavy armlets on their heads!) Of course, you 
cannot just make helms with diamonds alone, in addition to Diamond Ore, 
you will need a chunk of Orichalcum, which appears as yellow tetrahedrals 
in the playing field. Orichalcum cannot be bought, but can be found in 
the hands of many strong enemies like the Behemoths and Zus in harder levels 
of the game. If you would not bother to kill those monsters, you will just 
have to wait for the item to appear for selection in the Item Selection 
Screen. Unlike the Diamond Armor, you do not need a Hard Shell.

*****BELTS FOR SELKIES*****
Design: Bronze Belt
Gauntlets: Bronze Belt
Materials: Bronze x1, 80 gil
Defense: 8
This is a small and weak upgrade for your Selkie. It is so cheap and useless 
that I suggest you save up for an Iron Belt instead. That 80 gil can be 
used for other constructive purposes.

Design: Iron Belt
Gauntlets: Iron Belt
Materials: Iron x1, 150 gil
Defense: 12
This is just the first real conventional Belt upgrade your Selkie can come 
across in this game. This is a bit too medieval really. After all, the 
blacksmiths later should be able to make steel by heating Iron in a Blast 
Furnace. However, the Iron Helm is much better than the Old Belt (Second 
hand goods are never any good) that you may appear to be wearing.

Design: Mythril Belt
Gauntlets: Mythril Belt
Materials: Mythril x1, 400 gil
Defense: 15
The Mythril Gauntlets are a substantial improvement to the Iron bELT, with 
an increment of 3 from the Iron Belt. Mythril appears in an octahedral 
from, similar to the way Iron and Bronze appear in the map. However, Mythril 
is blue in colour. Although Mythril is available in shops, I would not 
recommend buying Mythril, as it is very expensive, at 5000 gil a chunk. 
Instead, you can kill relatively strong enemies and they may hold Mythril. 
It is very common indeed.

Design: Diamond Belt
Shield: Diamond Belt
Materials: Orichalcum x1, Diamond Ore x1, 2000 gil
Defense: 22
Wow, this is one thing that I have never seen before. A Belt made from 
Diamond! As diamonds are basically the hardest substance ever to be found 
on earth, I really would be surprised to find blacksmiths in this game 
having the technology to craft such strong armor. As it is so hard, you 
get another 5 point increment in defense over the Mythril Helm, and you 
would prove a tough nut to crack when you are wearing it. (Say, isn't diamond 
a little bit heavy, it is amazing that the poor Selkie will not be weighed 
down with such a heavy belt around their hips!) Of course, you cannot just 
make belts with diamonds alone, in addition to Diamond Ore, you will need 
a chunk of Orichalcum, which appears as yellow tetrahedrals in the playing 
field. Orichalcum cannot be bought, but can be found in the hands of many 
strong enemies like the Behemoths and Zus in harder levels of the game.

for the item to appear for selection in the Item Selection Screen. Unlike 
the Diamond Armor, you do not need a Hard Shell.

---------------
Jegon River
----------------
Type of Area: Town

This area is to the west of Marr's Past. There really is nothing here, 
just a long curved path leading to a house, with a pier to the left of 
it. The first time you come here, there should not be anyone at the pier 
at all. However, after you wait another year, a boatman by the name of 
Tristan will be there. He will first offer to send you across the river 
for a price of 50 gil. Later, you will be able to sail back to Port Tipa 
for 100 gil, to Mount Kilanda for 500 gil and Leuda, for 500 gil. If you 
cross the river, you would end up in the Fields of Fum, which is yet another 
area covered in a later chapter of this strategy guide.

When you return to this river some years later, you may find that the Jegon 
River would have dried up, and you would not be able to cross over to the 
other side. This is because, there is a problem with the origin of the 
River Jegon, back upstream at Veo Lu Sluice. To refill the river back to 
its former glory, please refer to the walkthrough of Veo Lu Sluice.

--------------------------------
v. Mine of Carthuiges [FFCC4B5]
--------------------------------
Type of Area: Level
Hot Spots: Fire

You will be shown the insides of the Mine of Carthages while you are briefed 
by the woman who sang the opening theme. When the woman's grandfather's 
grandfather's grandfather was still a child (That's 6 generations ago!) 
No one can ever challenge the might of the Lilties. The Lilties forged 
weapons from iron to bring the world under their dominion. But eventually, 
the mine was exhausted, and the Lilties' unstoppable conquest ground to 
a halt. The Lilties' ambition vanished along with the iron, and they 
abandoned the mine, where monsters now thrive. Speaking of monsters, here 
are the monsters that thrive in this abandoned mine.

---------------
Enemies
---------------
Orc:
HP: 40, 50
Attacks:
Double Bit Axe Chop (Double Bit Axe Wielding Orcs)
Spear Smash (Orc Spearmen)
Large Mace Slam (Mace Wielding Orcs)
Shield Bash
Running Rugby Tackle
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Slow, Paralysis
Yes, those nasty beings are back from the Lord of the Rings. The Orc is 
the dominant character of the Mine of Carthuiges. There are just everywhere. 
There are just like to the Mine of Carthuiges as the Goblins are to the 
Goblin Wall. Orcs are armed with different weapons. Orcs can either have 
a double Bit axe (An Axe with blades on either side of the handle), a spear, 
or a giant mace that they can use to smash down on your character. The 
spear and the mace can knock your character down and stun them. So, be 
aware of this. Sometimes, Orcs can just ambush you out of nowhere. They 
run at you, and will dive down onto the ground at you at the last moment, 
similar to the Rugby Tackle. This move is difficult to stop even if you 
can anticipate. Your best bet would be to run back the instant he dives. 
Besides, each Orc is equipped with a shield. When fighting in close quarters, 
an Orc may just swing their shield out and knock you back. Or they may 
just hold their shield up to guard against any attacks you may pull on 
them. They are the most vulnerable when in the latter pose, as you can 
run around behind him and deliver maybe 3 to 4 hits before they move again. 
Orcs are rather easy to detect, they sometimes may hold their shield up 
in the air, while laughing in a charismatic tone, and that's when you know 
an Orc is nearby, and has seen you.

Fire Bomb:
HP: 30
Attacks:
Airborne Tackle
Fire
Meteor Strike
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Lightning
Resistance: Fire
Useful Items: Magma Rock, Flame Craft, Design for Flame Armor
The Fire Bomb is well, some sort of black sphere like creature with flames 
as hair, and two pairs of evil looking eyes. These enemies are nothing 
but an annoyance, and usually will not pose too much of a threat to you. 
When you are up close to them, they may just swing back and attempt to 
ram into your character. The Fire Bomb knows two different spells. They 
can cast Fire on your character, or even worse, perform a Meteor Strike 
on you! The Meteor Strike is denoted by a pinkish red coloured targeting 
ring with a black circle in the center. When the attack is released, a 
large meteor will drop down from the sky, and onto the targeting ring. 
This move works indoors as well. The meteor strike can do considerable 
damage to your character. Fortunately it has a long delay, and you can 
easily run away from the ring long before the meteor is released upon thee. 
Although the Fire Bomb is vulnerable to cold and lightning, normal physical 
attacks will do. Although the Fire Bomb may be hard to hit while it is 
casting a spell, as it will float rather high up. Once a Fire Bomb is 
destroyed, it will self destruct, burning any enemies or you that appear 
to come too close. You can take advantage of this and destroy a Fire Bomb 
in the middle of a group of enemies and let them all take damage at once. 
Just get out of the proximity before the explosion. Once a Fire Bomb dies, 
it may drop a magma rock, a flame craft or a design for flame armor. Therefore, 
if you are after anti-flame protection devices, you should always go after 
those Fire Bombs.

Orc Mage:
HP: 40
Attacks:
Fire
Thunder
Blizzard
Slow
Curse
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Slow, Paralysis
The Orc Mage is just the mage of the Orc Army. There are just like the 
Goblin Mages to the Goblins. An Orc Mage can be spotted by their distinctive 
darker color than the standard issue Orcs, as well as their magic staff. 
An Orc Mage will just cast the usual 4 spells on you all the time. Just 
let him aim at you. Then run at him and then you can bash him to death. 
Is this clear? But be aware of situations where the Orc Mage will be shielded 
by his fellow Orc Soldiers. Then, you would be in a tougher predicament.

Cockatrice (Cycle 2 onwards):
HP: 45
Attacks:
Energy Ball Attack
Slow
Poison Gas (Poisons)
Petrifying Peck (Petrifies)
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Slow, Paralysis
Useful Item: Cockatrice Scale
It is amazing that the word Cockatrice is actually included in the 
programming of Microsoft Word. A Cockatrice is some sort of a ground based 
bird with blue green scales, a beak and wings with a purple edge. These 
enemies do have quite a good defense to withstand physical attacks. There 
are lots of ways for Cockatrices to attack you. When you are far away, 
a Cockatrice will fire an energy ball at you, or they may fold their wings 
in front of themselves and cast Slow on you to slow you down. At close 
quarters, a Cockatrice may peck you with its beak, and will turn you into 
stone while doing so. It may also wind back and let out a gust of green 
poison gas that poisons you if you are close. As Cockatrices are vulnerable 
to fire, you should try to cast Fire once on them to weaken their defenses 
before moving in with your physical attacks. Otherwise, Cockatrices alone 
cannot deal too much damage to you itself. Sometimes, Cockatrices may drop 
Cockatrice Scales for you to collect. It can be used to craft a Gold Necklace 
or to forge Gold Armlets for Lilties.

Ogre:
HP: 120
Attacks:
Giant Punch
Hammer Attack
Hammer Ground Slam Shock Wave
Vulnerability: Lightning
Useful Item: Ogre Fang
The Ogres of Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles look like some kind of 
oversized walrus with grey armor and a giant hammer in their hands. They 
are really tough, with their 120 HP, and they really can pack a punch. 
All of his attacks can knock your character down, and his Hammer Ground 
Slam Shock Wave will send a very large shock wave that covers a very wide 
radius. Therefore, whenever you see an Ogre slowly raising his hammer 
behind the back of his head, be prepared to run very far away, or you will 
be caught in the shockwave. As the Ogres are so tough, it is not a good 
idea to get into a brawl with them. Therefore, you should always try to 
shock him for a short while with a Thunder spell, and he will be rendered 
temporarily immobile. Whenever you see the Ogre begin to get up, quickly 
cast another Thunder spell to keep him down. Eventually he will be killed. 
When an Ogre dies, he may drop an Ogre Fang, which can be used to craft 
the victorious weapon for all 4 tribes.

Ice Bomb (Cycle 2 onwards):
HP: 37
Attacks:
Airborne Tackle
Blizzard
Meteor Strike
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Lightning
Resistance: Cold
Useful Items: Chilly Gel, Frost Craft, Design for Frost Armor
The Ice Bomb is well, some sort of black sphere like creature with blue 
fumes as hair, and two pairs of evil looking eyes. These enemies are nothing 
but an annoyance, and usually will not pose too much of a threat to you. 
When you are up close to them, they may just swing back and attempt to 
ram into your character. The Ice Bomb knows two different spells. They 
can cast Blizzard on your character, or even worse, perform a Meteor Strike 
on you! The Meteor Strike is denoted by a pinkish red coloured targeting 
ring with a black circle in the center. When the attack is released, a 
large meteor will drop down from the sky, and onto the targeting ring. 
This move works indoors as well. The meteor strike can do considerable 
damage to your character. Fortunately it has a long delay, and you can 
easily run away from the ring long before the meteor is released upon thee. 
Although the Ice Bomb is vulnerable to cold and lightning, normal physical 
attacks will do. The Ice Bomb may be hard to hit while it is casting a 
spell, as it will float rather high up. Once an Ice Bomb is destroyed, 
it will self destruct, freezing any enemies or you that appear to come 
too close. You can take advantage of this and destroy an Ice Bomb in the 
middle of a group of enemies and let them all take damage at once. Just 
get out of the proximity before the explosion. Once an Ice Bomb dies, it 
may drop a blob of Chilly Gel, a frost craft or a design for frost armor. 
Therefore, if you are after anti-cold protection devices, you should always 
go after those Ice Bombs.

Bat (Cycle 2 onwards):
HP: 15
Attacks:
Headbutt
Vulnerability: All attacks when grounded
Resistance: All attacks when airborne
This is yet another pestilence in this level. Bats in this game flutter 
around, headbutting your characters as they go. If you attempt to hit them 
while they are flying, regardless of how hard you try, they can still only 
lose one HP per hit. However, it is another story if you have grounded 
them with gravity. Then, they will become much more vulnerable, and can 
be taken out with a couple of hits with you weapon. 

Thunder Bomb (Cycle 2 onwards):
HP: 37
Attacks:
Airborne Tackle
Thunder
Meteor Strike
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Cold
Resistance: Lightning
Useful Items: Thunderball, Lightning Craft, Design for Lightning Armor
The Thunder Bomb is well, some sort of black sphere like creature with 
purple fumes as hair, and two pairs of evil looking eyes with electric 
bolts all over it. These enemies are nothing but an annoyance, and usually 
will not pose too much of a threat to you. When you are up close to them, 
they may just swing back and attempt to ram into your character. The Thunder 
Bomb knows two different spells. They can cast Thunder on your character, 
or even worse, perform a Meteor Strike on you! The Meteor Strike is denoted 
by a pinkish red coloured targeting ring with a black circle in the center. 
When the attack is released, a large meteor will drop down from the sky, 
and onto the targeting ring. This move works indoors as well. The meteor 
strike can do considerable damage to your character. Fortunately it has 
a long delay, and you can easily run away from the ring long before the 
meteor is released upon thee. Although the Thunder Bomb is vulnerable to 
cold and lightning, normal physical attacks will do. The Thunder Bomb may 
be hard to hit while it is casting a spell, as it will float rather high 
up. Once a Thunder Bomb is destroyed, it will self destruct, shocking any 
enemies or you that appear to come too close. You can take advantage of 
this and destroy a Thunder Bomb in the middle of a group of enemies and 
let them all take damage at once. Just get out of the proximity before 
the explosion. Once a Thunder Bomb dies, it may drop a Thunderball, a 
Lighting craft or a design for lightning armor. Therefore, if you are after 
anti-lightning protection devices, you should always go after those 
Thunder Bombs.

Wraith (Cycle 2 onwards):
HP: 50
Attacks:
Blue Staff Poke
Slow
Vulnerabilities: Holy
Resistance: All attacks when invisible
Wraiths are some invisible beings which look like mages with brown pointed 
hats holding a blue staff. Although the Wraith has only one attack, that 
attack is not to be underestimated. The Blue Staff Poke can deal quite 
a lot of damage to anything that it hits. The Wraith is quite tough, not 
only it has a high HP, it is invisible. Therefore, you must reveal these 
enemies with a single Holy spell before you can even think about attacking 
him. The Wraiths are particularly vulnerable when they are casting Slow, 
due to their long delay. Only move in then.

---------------
Walkthrough
---------------
As soon as you start, you will notice a mine cart right in front of you. 
Hit it with your weapon to bring it forward. Then move forward along the 
track, until you reach a T-junction. An Orc will ambush you from the left. 
Kill him to obtain a stone of Cure. Perfect, now you can heal yourself. 
Then, go to the left, off the track. You will arrive in a room with a slope 
going upwards, as well as a Fire Hot Spot. There is a Fire Bomb here, along 
with another Orc in this level. Kill them both. You can find a stone of 
Life on the Orc. Then go up the slope.

Move along the catwalk above in a clockwise direction. You will first 
encounter an Orc Mage. He is now holding a stone of Thunder. Get it now. 
Then continue along the catwalk. You should run into a treasure chest. 
Open it, it contains money, and maybe as little as 10 gil. There is another 
Orc to the left. Go there and kill him. Then, you can just rob him of his 
money. Go down the slope and back to the T-junction.

At the T-Junction, turn right and follow the tracks. You will run into 
the mine cart again, as well as another Orc besides it. Kill the Orc and 
take his plume of Phoenix Down. Then, hit the mine cart and send it forwards, 
right into the pile of crates blocking the way, destroying while you are.

You will find yourself to be in a bigger room than before, with lots of 
Orcs around. This time, there are spearmen and mace wielding Orcs as well. 
Kill them all as they come at you. They are all holding food items and 
money. At the same time, you will come to a mine track junction, with a 
track selector switch. As you can see, the downward path leads to a tunnel, 
and you don't want the cart to go in there. The upward path is what you 
need. Therefore, step on the upper switch and the tracks will be realigned, 
allowing you to hit the mine cart and send it upwards to the north. There 
are no more enemies here, aside from a treasure chest with money. Follow 
the tracks and knock the mine cart forward to break the crates and reveal 
another passage. Enter the passage, knocking the mine cart forward as you 
go. There is nothing in the passage.

You will find yourself to be yet another room. There is a welcoming 
committee comprised of an Orc, an Orc Mage and a Cockatrice waiting for 
you. The Orc holds a stone of Fire, the Orc Mage holds a seed. There is 
a chest to the right with a stone of Clear, so you can recover from poisoning 
very quickly now. Hit the mine cart and knock it forwards. Then go to the 
left and go through the passage there. There is a Fire Bomb in the passage. 
Kill it and you will come to another room with a Fire Hot Spot. There is 
a single Fire Bomb here. Kill him before going up the slope.

An Orc Mage is at the top of the slope. He holds nothing, just money, but 
still, kill him for more points and circle the catwalk. There is another 
passageway on the other side. Inside, there is an Orc with a plume of Phoenix 
Down, as well as a Fire Bomb. Kill them both and go through the passage. 
You will find yourself to be on a catwalk above the previous room. Now, 
let us walk around this room in a clockwise direction, as before. There 
is an Orc with maybe a chunk of Mythril, or maybe a bag of diamond ore. 
Then, there is a chest with maybe Speed Secrets. Then, there is a treasure 
chest with money, and then an Orc with maybe a design for Mythril Armor. 
There is another Orc on the bridge joining the two sides of the catwalk, 
and he holds money too. With all these items in hand, return to the room 
where you found the Cockatrice. GO north and engage the Orc, the Fire Bomb 
and the Cockatrice. The Cockatrice may have a Diamond Ore on it. There 
is also an Ogre here. He has an artifact on him. Get rid of him and collect 
the artifact. You will some to yet another branch line of the mine cart 
system. You are to divert the mine cart so that it goes north into the 
pile of crates. Therefore, step on the upper switch before hitting the 
mine cart. A passage is revealed. Go through the passage.

You will be in another room with a mine cart track, only that you do not 
need the mine cart anymore. You will be instantly confronted by 2 Orcs 
and a Cockatrice. One of the Orcs holds a stone of Blizzard, while the 
other has food in hand. Go to the left, there is another Orc with a stone 
of Blizzard to the right of a slope. There is another Fire Bomb and a 
Cockatrice to the north. Go up the slope and up to the catwalk above. This 
time, circle it in an anticlockwise direction. You will find another Orc, 
as well as 2 Treasure Chests containing maybe diamond ore and a tiny crystal. 
Then get back down to the ground. Go to the right, there is another slope 
leading to a catwalk above. Kill the Fire Bomb and the Orc up there and 
open the chest for maybe a chunk of mythril. Then go down. There are 2 
other treasure chests in this room with a stone of Cure and a stone of 
Life. There is a locked gate with a pedestal. The key is in the hands of 
the Orc, who also has an artifact in his hand. Kill him, get the artifact 
and go through the gate you unlocked with the key.

You will find yourself in a long series of bridges overlooking a large 
pool of water below. The first enemy you will meet is an Orc with a plume 
of Phoenix Down. Then, you will come to a very large island. There is an 
Ice Bomb and an Orc with a stone of Blizzard. There is also a chest with 
a stone of Clear. Now, continue along the next bridge. You will meet another 
Orc and a Bat before you reach the next island.

The next island has an Orc with a stone of Thunder, a Thunder Bomb, and 
a chest with another artifact. Now, if you follow the bridge to the left 
of the chest, you will come to another moogle house, where you can have 
your card stamped by the resident moogle. Then, get back out and go along 
the bridge to the north. You will encounter 2 Wraiths and a Goblin Mage 
before you reach the next island. This is the final island before the boss. 
There is a Goblin Mage, an Ice Bomb and an Ogre. This Ogre is the only 
Ogre in this level that may have an Ogre Fang. There is a chest with another 
artifact, or it may be empty. When you are ready, go through that opening 
to fight the boss, the Orc King.

You enter a giant room, and find no one in there, you are about to enter 
the chamber where the myrrh tree is, but suddenly the Orc King jumps into 
the room and challenges you to a fight. It's time to have a cage match 
to the death with our friend, the Orc King!

---------------
Boss Battle
---------------
Boss: Orc King
HP: 400
Attacks:
Giant Orc Hammer Slam
Charged Staff Explosion Slam
Staff Explosion Slam
Self Destruct (HP<70)
Minions: 2 Orcs
Useful Item: Orc Belt
Yes, the King of the Orcs is here to defend the myrrh tree. The selfish 
fool. He has 2 of his lower level Orcs coming from both sides of the arena 
to help him. Although it may be tough to beat so many foes coming from 
both sides at once, there is actually a way to quickly removing his minions. 

As you can see, you may have found 2 or 3 stones of Blizzard in the entire 
level. Therefore, you can go to the Command List on your menu, and line 
3 stones of Blizzard together to create the Blizzaga spell, which is the 
ultimate Blizzard Spell, now, just position your self at a remote corner 
and charge up the attack. Wait for the Orc King and his minions to get 
close, and then release the Blizzaga. A very large snowflake will appear, 
engulfing the Orcs and damaging the Orc King at the same time. Repeat this 
maneuver for a couple of times, and all the Orcs will be killed. Then, 
you can turn your attention to the maybe already damaged Orc King.

The Orc King likes to slam his blunt objects onto the ground to hurt you. 
Firstly, he can swing his Orc Hammer down onto you with his right hand. 
This deals considerable damage to you, but will not stun you at all. His 
Charged Staff Explosion Slam is just as damaging, and involves the Orc 
King raising his staff, charging it and aiming it at the targeting ring 
on the ground, before releasing a fiery explosion there. This is not hard 
to ignore, but the worst situation you will be in is when an Orc managed 
to stun you with his shield just a second before the Orc King releases 
his attack. Therefore, it is important that all Orcs should be terminated 
before the Orc King is faced. Sometimes, if you are outsmarting him a lot, 
the Orc King will just grow impatient and cheat. He will use his Staff 
Explosion Slam without having to charge up, and this is yet another 
annoyance to the typical player.

If your stats are not high enough, you should have a battle of attrition 
and only hit the Orc King while he is charging up the Charged Staff Explosion 
Slam. The other two attacks are so hard to avoid as they are so unpredictable. 
Slowly but steadily, you will drain HP from him. By the time he has had 
fewer than 70 HP, he will start burning up. I suggest you run away and 
hide in a corner. This is because, he is about to self destruct. Wait, 
wait, then you will find the room suddenly becoming very bright and hear 
a very loud explosion, and all of his Orc minions collapsing at the same 
time. After the room has quieted down, go over to the Orc King and he should 
drop to the ground and explode once more. Then you would have won!

You can finally collect the drop of myrrh you want. Then you can receive 
the letter from Mail Moogle. Then reply and enter the bonus screen. 

*****TWO PLAYER STRATEGY*****
The good thing about this battle is that. With 2 players, the Orc King 
will have a little more HP than when you meet him at single player, but 
however, the increment is minimal compared with the combined attack power 
of the two characters. Besides, the Orc King will still only have 2 Orcs 
to assist him, so this match really is a 2 to 3 match, which sort of levels 
the odds by a lot already!

Your first task will be to neutralize the two Orcs. Now, while you are 
dodging the Orc King's hammers and blasts, separate and butcher the two 
Orcs around. Then you can turn your attention to the Orc King himself. 
As you may notice, ALL of the Orc King's attacks are unidirectional. Which 
means that they can only attack in one direction, namely, the area in front 
of him. There is also a long lag in his Charge Hammer Slam attack. So, 
at most of the time, have the stronger character attack him from the front, 
while the other attacks from behind or from a range. Be ready to switch 
duties when the Orc King decides to go after the one coming from behind. 
When he is charging his hammer, just hide behind him and bash.

When the Orc King is about to self destruct, pick up the Chalice and quickly 
move to a corner of the room. If you cannot find the Chalice because the 
Orc King is blocking it, just forget it and RUN! Keep casting Cure on 
yourselves to prevent yourselves from dying! Then as soon as the explosion 
is over, run over and deal the final blow, or just wait for the ending 
scene. Done.

--------------
Miasma Stream
--------------
This is where you cross over to get to Vale of Alfataria. Make sure that 
your Crystal Chalice's element matches that of the stream. Otherwise, a 
powerful force field will knock your character back. Having crossed over 
the stream, you will arrive at Vale of Alfataria. Please note that this 
guide will cover the Plains of Fum before Vale of Alfataria, if you wish 
to read the strategies for Vale of Alfataria, I suggest you use this search 
key to skip over [FFCC4D].

--------------------------
c. Plains of Fum [FFCC4C]
--------------------------
This is the area on the west bank of the Jegon River. No this is not the 
west bank of River Jordan, so there will not be any conflict between any 
Israelites and Palestinians. Everything is rather peaceful, just the 
occasional conflict between the travelers and monsters. The Fields of Fum 
is another populated area. There are a total of 5 areas to be explored, 
as well as 2 junctions. They are the west bank of the Jegon River, where 
you came from, the Fields of Fum, which is an agricultural community 
comprised of mainly Clavats. Then there is the Selepation Cave, a cave 
level that is said to generate wind. There is also a level called Daemon 
Court, where a lot of lizard soldiers hang around. Then, there is another 
Miasma stream that leads to Rebena Plains, another area to the west of 
the Plains of Fum.

----------------------
Jegon River West Bank
----------------------
There is a winding path leading to the Plains of Fum here. However, if 
you look carefully, you will notice a hole in the fence, leading to a hole 
in the hill. Inside, is another moogle house. Have him stamp your card 
and then get out of there. Get to the world map now.

---------------------------
i. Fields of Fum [FFCC4C1]
---------------------------
Type of Area: Town
Number of Merchants: 1 or 2
The Fields of Fum is a farming community with Clavats making up most of 
the population. Most people just farm in the fields, raise cattle and plant 
Striped Apples. The layout of the Fields of Fum is rather circular. So, 
let us explore the Fields of Fum in an anticlockwise way, shall we? But 
first, I would like to introduce the Crystal Caravan of the Fields of Fum.

Crystal Caravan: Jake, Sheula, Lulie, Andy
The Crystal Caravan of the Fields of Fum consists of 4 Clavats, 2 male, 
and 2 female who really are very friendly in nature. They all wear the 
same yellow coloured outfit with the same type of farmer's hat. Sometimes, 
when you meet them on the road, Sheula will ask whether the weather is 
lovely. Then, Jake will say how impressed he is that the trees can grow 
strong in the miasma, and probably each tree has some of the crystal's 
strength. Then, Lulie will say that they are stopping for a meal, and would 
you join them. Andy will tell you that they have a vegetable (Round Corn, 
Gourd Potato or Star Carrot) or a fruit (Striped Apple, Rainbow Grabes, 
Cherry Cluster) fresh from their fields. No meat, sorry. Regardless of 
what food they offer, always say that you will be honored, and you will 
receive one free sample of the food in question. Then, you will have Sheula 
planting the seeds of the food that they ate, she will babble on how fertile 
the soil, and how well they'll grow, etc. etc.

Sometimes, you will find their caravan stopping at the side of the road, 
and you will be stopped by Sheula, asking you if you are short of any items. 
If you are, tell her so, and you can get to buy some from her at the price 
you bargain for. This is what may happen when you happen to run into them.

Now, let's explore the Fields of Fum. Go to your right, to the bridge, 
and examine the tree stump. There will be a hidden item. Then cross the 
bridge. You will encounter a traveling merchant. He may be here, or may 
not. He appears every alternate year. His name is Gi Lubeh a Selkie, he 
offers the following items for sale:

*****GI LUBEH THE MERCHANT*****
Bronze	300 gil
Iron	500 gil
Mythril	5000 gil
Bronze Shard	100 gil
Iron Shard	100 gil

Iron Belt*	100 gil
Mythril Belt*	250 gil
Iron Sallet*	100 gil
Mythril Sallet*	250 gil
* = Designs
Anything can be bought from him, but do not buy Mythril, it is a waste 
of money. However, if you do have excess Mythril, you can sell them to 
him for 1250 gil per chunk.

Now, let us move on. To the northwest is a field owned by Emilia and Sean, 
protected by a small crystal. Then to the west, you will come across a 
striped apple orchard, and some kids will tell you about catching a 
particular apple thief. Then go south and along the path. You will com 
to a cow farm, where you can bet on a cow race to win money on certain 
years. If you go along the fence, you will find a woman named Mileu. You 
can buy a cow from her for 500 gil. Send the cow home, and you can get 
bottles of milk every year round. While you are walking along the fence, 
you will come to a Moogle House. Enter and have the Moogle inside stamp 
your card.

There is also a woman called Nina who is standing by a windmill. She will 
offer to sell you delicious produce from the Fields of Fum.

*****NINA THE MERCHANT*****
Striped Apple	40 gil
Cherry Cluster	40 gil
Rainbow Grapes	40 gil
Star Carrot	40 gil
Gourd Potato	40 gil
Round Corn	40 gil

This is the basic layout of the Fields of Fum. Feel free to come and visit. 
Leave for now.

------------------------------
ii. Selepation Cave [FFCC4C2]
------------------------------
Type of Area: Level
Hot Spots: Wind
You will be again, briefed by the woman. The wind inside the Selepation 
Cave is strong. Legend has it that every gust of wind is born in this cave. 
The wind chills the woman's face, she thinks that another gust of wind 
has been born. She is sure that the wind will travel across the land, 
gathering more and more memories, getting warmer, and that is when it will 
return to the cave.

---------------
Enemies
---------------
Lizardman:
HP: 37
Attacks: 
Dagger Slash (Dagger Wielding Lizardmen)
Mace Bash (Mace Wielding Lizardmen)
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Slow, Paralysis
Well, this is what you get when you cross Lizards with men, Lizardmen! 
The Lizardmen of the Selepation Cave are green in colour, and they make 
hissing sounds of lizards, and they all wear a grey suit of armor, and 
have spines like those of Stegosauruses. There are two types of Lizardmen 
here. There are ones which carry a dagger with them, and will chop you 
with them, there are others who carry a mace with 4 spikes, and will bash 
you hard, and stunning you at the same time. The latter type are more 
dangerous than the former type. Fortunately, all Lizardmen are vulnerable 
to cold, which means you can always surprise them from behind by a well 
placed Blizzara or Blizzaga, and then they can suffer the pain. Hit and 
run tactics also work fine against these freaks, as they can only attack 
in close quarters with their blunt objects.

Electric Jellyfish:
HP: 30
Attacks:
Headbutt
Thunder
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Slow
Resistance: Lightning
Useful Item: Thunderball
This is just one of the silliest enemies that Square-Enix can think of, 
after all, what kind of Jellyfish can float in air and have electricity? 
The Electric Jellyfish are yet another annoying enemy in this level. They 
can float over and headbutt you, stunning you for a short time. When you 
are far away, they can cast Thunder on you. Besides, you cannot hit these 
pests directly, or you will get an electric shock. (Protect yourself with 
Wind Element or a Thunder Badge) I would therefore recommend using Blizzard 
or Fire on them, or just use Focus Attacks that are ballistic in nature. 
Electric Jellyfish tend to carry Thunderballs with them, and they can be 
used to forge Lightning Armor and Thunder Badges, which help your character 
to resist lightning based attacks.

Lizardman Mage:
HP: 37
Attacks: 
Fire
Fira
Thunder
Blizzard
Slow
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Slow, Paralysis
The Lizardman Mages are just Lizardmen, but they are trained with the 
ability to cast spells, while the standard Lizardmen are there for close 
quarters combat. Lizardman Mages, like the normal Lizardmen are green in 
the Selepation Cave. They are harder to distinguish than the Lizardman, 
as they really have not many differences in appearance. The only difference 
is that they carry a magic staff with them. The Lizardman Mage casts quite 
a lot of spells. He casts all the conventional spell, as well as the powerful 
Fira move. The Fira spell has a wider radius and can hit you multiple times, 
so beware. Otherwise, you can just let him aim at you, and then you can 
run at the Lizardman during the long delay and waste him. Yes, regardless 
of what monsters they are, all the mages are pretty vulnerable on their 
own, when no front line soldiers are supporting them.

Killer Bee:
HP: 15
Attack:
Air Tackle
Vulnerability: Gravity
Resistance: All attacks when airborne
The Killer Bee is yet another tiny little creepy crawly that can prove 
to be just as an annoyance to those Bats around. They are golden yellow 
in colour, they have white wings and a very long stinger. Fortunately these 
guys do not sting you. Instead, they will just ram into you with their 
air tackles. Although this does little damage, it can knock your character 
back, which is rather annoying at times. Like all other flying enemies, 
they are very resistant to all attacks while they are flying. Therefore, 
you can always use a single Gravity Spell to bring them down onto the ground 
before you start bashing them silly.

Blazer Beetle:
HP: 80
Attacks:
Double Claw Slash
Horn Drill
Vulnerabilities: All Magic Spells
No, this is no new model of the Volkswagen Beetle. This is just another 
giant insect enemy of Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles. Blazer Beetles 
are well, just like Beetles. They have a black shell, which is very hard, 
and he has a very long horn with a pointed tip. His two forelegs are razor 
sharp. A Blazer Beetle does not know any spells. Therefore, he can only 
rely on some close quarters combat, which is very damaging to your character, 
First, a Blazer Beetle can swipe you twice with both of his claws, he can 
also use his sharp horn to drill into your character. The latter attack 
is easily detectable and hence avoidable. If you see the Blazer Beetle 
moving his body back and some red and yellow light on his horn, then you 
can tell that he is about to hit you with that move. Don't ever get hit, 
not only you will be knocked back, you will receive quite heavy damage. 
As Blazer Beetles have so much HP, I would suggest you exploit his weakness. 
You should either freeze it or paralyze it. Then you can land in quite 
a number of free hits before it can retaliate. Whenever Blazer Beetles 
die, they may drop Hard Shells, which can be used to forge diamond armor.

Lizard Skirmisher:
HP: 37
Attacks: 
Spear Throw
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Slow, Paralysis
Do you know what a Skirmisher is? A skirmisher is a soldier in the army 
that throws spears at the enemy. They are often used with archers in battle. 
The Lizard Skirmishers are just the type of Lizardman who is always holding 
a spear in their hands. The Lizard Skirmishers in the Selepation Cave are 
green in colour, much like their infantry counterparts. Of course, Lizard 
Skirmishers always attack by throwing spears at you. The spears definitely 
have a much longer range than the close combat weapons of the other 
Lizardmen. Most of the time, Lizardman Skirmishers do not work alone. They 
are often teamed up with other Lizardmen. Whenever a whole group attacks, 
the Lizard Skirmishers often stay behind the ranks to throw their spears 
at you while the Lizardmen cover them. This makes the Skirmishers very 
annoying enemies. But once the vanguard is destroyed, the Lizard 
Skirmishers are rather helpless. All it takes is some hit and running to 
bring these lizard artillery units down.

Lizard Captain:
HP: 37
Attacks:
Dagger Slash (Dagger Wielding Lizard Captains)
Curse
Vulnerabilities: Slow, Paralysis
I have just figured out, that many armies of enemies in the game are quite 
analogous to each other. The Goblins have the normal Goblin, the Goblin 
Mage and the Goblin Chieftain. The Lizards on the other hand, have the 
Lizardmen, the Lizard Mage, the Lizard Skirmishers and the Lizard Captain. 
The Lizard Captain is well, analogous to the Goblin Chieftain. The Lizard 
Captain is actually a giant Lizardman. Like the lower ranked Lizardmen, 
Lizard Captains are green in colour. Most of the time, the Lizardman Captain 
will simply slash you with his larger dagger, dealing more damage than 
the typical Lizardman. However, he is quite dangerous when you are far 
away from him. Instead of running after you, the Lizard Captain will attempt 
to put a Curse on your character, halving their stats before moving in. 
Therefore, the element of surprise is the most important when you have 
to face these giant monsters. Although Lizard Captains are resistant to 
Blizzards, they can still be frozen in by Blizzara or Blizzaga. This is 
how you can ambush them from a range.

Bat:
HP: 15
Attacks:
Headbutt
Vulnerability: All attacks when grounded
Resistance: All attacks when airborne
This is yet another pestilence in this level. Bats in this game flutter 
around, headbutting your characters as they go. If you attempt to hit them 
while they are flying, regardless of how hard you try, they can still only 
lose one HP per hit. However, it is another story if you have grounded 
them with gravity. Then, they will become much more vulnerable, and can 
be taken out with a couple of hits with you weapon. 

Sonic Bat (Cycle 2 onwards):
HP: 15
Attacks:
Headbutt
Supersonic Pulse
Vulnerability: All attacks when grounded
Resistance: All attacks when airborne
This is yet another pestilence in this level. Sonic Bats are an enhanced 
version of the Bat, they appear blue-green in colour. Besides headbutting 
your character, it can launch some supersonic pulses at you, which can 
stun you momentarily, giving you a headache. If you attempt to hit them 
while they are flying, regardless of how hard you try, they can still only 
lose one HP per hit. However, it is another story if you have grounded 
them with gravity. Then, they will become much more vulnerable, and can 
be taken out with a couple of hits with you weapon. 

Cockatrice:
HP: 45
Attacks:
Energy Ball Attack
Slow
Poison Gas (Poisons)
Petrifying Peck (Petrifies)
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Slow, Paralysis
Useful Item: Cockatrice Scale
It is amazing that the word Cockatrice is actually included in the 
programming of Microsoft Word. A Cockatrice is some sort of a ground based 
bird with blue green scales, a beak and wings with a purple edge. These 
enemies do have quite a good defense to withstand physical attacks. There 
are lots of ways for Cockatrices to attack you. When you are far away, 
a Cockatrice will fire an energy ball at you, or they may fold their wings 
in front of themselves and cast Slow on you to slow you down. At close 
quarters, a Cockatrice may peck you with its beak, and will turn you into 
stone while doing so. It may also wind back and let out a gust of green 
poison gas that poisons you if you are close. As Cockatrices are vulnerable 
to fire, you should try to cast Fire once on them to weaken their defenses 
before moving in with your physical attacks. Otherwise, Cockatrices alone 
cannot deal too much damage to you itself. Sometimes, Cockatrices may drop 
Cockatrice Scales for you to collect. It can be used to craft a Gold Necklace 
or to forge Gold Armlets for Lilties.

Gigas:
HP: 150
Attacks:
Giant Punch
Ice Breath (Freezes)
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Slow
Resistance: Cold
Useful Item: Gigas Claw
Gigas look like a rip off version of the beast in Disney's Beauty and the 
Beast, of come sort. They have the same sort of grin as the Beast, and 
they have a blue upper body and brown legs. Gigas do pack a punch. In fact, 
he can use his giant fists to giant punch you most of the time. This deals 
considerable damage and has the ability to knock your character back, 
stunning him/her for a short while. A Gigas can also exhale some Ice Breath 
at you. Of course, it can freeze the victim on contact. In spite of the 
heavy attack power it possesses, a Gigas is quite slow, as he has to use 
hit arms to propel himself forwards after you. He may have 120 HP, but 
he can be weakened using a Fire spell. Just do not try to use a Blizzard 
spell on him as it just will not work against him. (Probably due to him 
being able to use his Ice Breath) Hit and run tactics also work well against 
a Gigas. When a Gigas is killed, he may drop a Gigas Claw, which may be 
used to craft the Charm of Speed, an accessory for Selkies.

Sahagin:
HP: 45
Attacks:
Claw Swipe
Blue Breath Attack
Ice Spike Jab (Freezes)
Blizzard
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Slow, Paralysis
The Sahagin is a blue-green coloured water creature that lives in many 
damp areas like the Selepation Cave and Conall Curach. They like to live 
in water, and when enemies (that's you), come close by, they will just 
out of the water to ambush them. This action is not hard to detect. You 
can hear the splash as the Sahagin jumps out of the water. The Sahagin 
is a decent fighter both in close range and long range. At close quarters, 
a Sahagin can just swipe you with its claws. When you are at medium range, 
a Sahagin will blow some blue breath to you that causes moderate damage. 
He can also stick out an ice spike from one of its claws and jab you with 
it. This attack has the ability to freeze any unsuspecting character in. 
Finally, a Sahagin can also cast Blizzard on you. A Sahagin has quite a 
high defense, and is resistant to many physical attacks. However, it is 
vulnerable towards Fire, and that's all you need to weaken them before 
moving in and brawl with them.

Walkthrough
---------------
As soon as you start, go forwards to the T-junction, and turn right. You 
will find a dagger wielding Lizardman waiting for you. Kill him, and he 
will drop a stone of Blizzard for a start. Continue to the right. Then, 
you will come across an Electric Jellyfish. Use any non-contact attacks 
to bring it down, and it will drop a stone of Thunder for your use. Then, 
you will notice a targeting ring beneath your character. That's right, 
there is now a Lizardman Mage to the right of your position. He can cast 
Fira, so be quick and slay him. He holds a stone of Cure. Now, you can 
cure yourself. Continue to the right. There is a killer bee here. Since 
you have Blizzard and Thunder, fuse the two spells together to make the 
Gravity Spell. Then, you can ground this pest and kill it in maybe 2 to 
3 hits. Meanwhile, his friend, a Blazer Beetle may have heard you fight 
the Killer Bee, and he will come to his fellow insect's assistance. Freeze 
him and kill him quick, he is very strong. Then, continue to the right. 
You will find a tunnel. Do not go through it yet. Instead, go back to the 
T-junction you began with.

This time, go to the left. You will come to a gate, guarded by 2 electric 
jellyfish. One of the Jellyfish holds a stone of Thunder, while the other 
holds a plume of Phoenix Down. Do not unlock the gate yet. Instead, go 
to the left. There is another Blazer Beetle supported by a Killer Bee. 
Kill the two. The Killer Bee holds a stone of Fire, while the Blazer Beetle 
holds a stone of Cure. Continue to the left. There is another Lizard Mage 
this time holding a stone of Fire. Kill him and go up the stairs. There 
is a treasure chest, guarded by another Lizard Mage. Kill him and get the 
contents of the chest. There may be a design for a Lightning Shield inside. 
Then get back down and go to the gate.

The gate is locked by some kind of percussion instrument locking mechanism, 
that resembles those of xylophones. If you are playing single player, two 
keys right next to each other will be lit with a purple light. You are 
to perform a Focus Attack on the two keys at once to open the gate. If 
you are playing a multiplayer game, then the third key will also be lit. 
Then, one of the players must perform a focus attack on the two adjacent 
keys while a second hits the third key. Either way, the gate will open 
go through. There is another Blazer Beetle in the way. Therefore, you should 
kill him while stunned. He holds another stone of Blizzard, so this would 
be your second stone of Blizzard. Therefore, you can fuse the two together, 
obtaining Blizzara, and then go to the right to face the Lizardman Trio. 
There is a Lizard Captain, a Lizard Skirmisher and a mace wielding Lizardman. 
I must say, such a combination is truly deadly here. Therefore, take them 
by surprise. Creep slowly until the Lizard trio are within range of your 
Blizzara. Then release the spell. You should be able to kill them before 
they are really able to figure out what's going on. If you have the Ring 
of Blizzard, then you might as well cast Blizzaga, and that will be much 
easier to cast. The Lizard Captain may hold a chunk of Mythril, while the 
Lizardman will hold a stone of Life. Now you can revive the dead.

With the three gone, go to the left. You will find another flight of steps. 
Go up, and you will find a treasure chest, that may contain a design for 
a Pure Belt. Keep the design if you are a Selkie, then go down the steps 
and go to the right. There is another of those musical gates, guarded by 
a Killer Bee and another Lizardman. The Lizardman may drop food when he 
dies. Then, unlock the gate as before and go through. Be careful, there 
is another Lizard Trio hanging to the left waiting for you. This time, 
there are two Lizardmen, one with a dagger, the other with a mace. Kill 
the three as sneakily as possible and grab their loot. Then, it is time 
for you to continue your way inside this cave. You will then come to 2 
more Blazer Beetles guarding a tunnel. Kill them and go through.

You are in the second area of the Selepation Cave. You will be immediately 
be confronted by a Cockatrice, a Sonic Bat and a Gigas. Surprised, aren't 
you? You better ground the Sonic Bat before you engage the two other enemies, 
as the Sonic Bat can shoot some sonic waves at you which can stun you. 
The Gigas is also very strong, and can freeze you in your tracks. A good 
dose of Fira can help weaken him as you fight him. I also figured out that 
as the Gigas is so large and bulky, he cannot run down the stairs to come 
after you. Take advantage of this, let him get stuck, and slowly kill him 
with your spells or Focus Attacks. When they are dead, go up the stairs. 
This area is actually a circular area. Therefore, you can always try to 
explore it in an anticlockwise direction. But first, go to the left. There 
is a Cockatrice and an Electric Jellyfish there. Another Cockatrice may 
come to their aid from the north. That one holds a plume of Phoenix Down. 
Go north, and you will find yourself in a very large room. There are quite 
a lot of enemies here. There are Sahagins, Cockatrices and Sonic Bats in 
this room. These enemies may hold money or food. When they are all killed, 
explore this room and you will find a treasure chest in a corner. There 
is an artefact inside. With it, go back to where you first saw the Gigas.

This time, go to the right, and you will find an Electric Jellyfish. Kill 
him and go south. You will find a winding path that leads to another tunnel.

You are now above the first area. There are lots of lifts that go down. 
But first, kill the Electric Jellyfish and the Gigas. Then, ride the first 
lift to the left down. You can now reach another island to the north. There 
is an Electric Jellyfish and a Killer Bee guarding a chest. Kill the two 
and open the chest. There may be a design for Mythril Armor inside. With 
this, take the lift back up and go to the right.

There is a Gigas and a Killer Bee blocking your way to the next lift. Kill 
them both and descend to the islands below. There are two islands you can 
explore. Get on the southern one first. There is a Gigas there. Then, go 
to the northern one. There is a Lizard Trio guarding a chest. Sneak up 
on them and use a couple of Blizzaras to finish them off. Then open the 
chest for another artefact. (It may contain a Ring of Thunder) You can 
now ride the lift back up.

There is a third lift, but you do not need to ride it down. Instead, go 
south, and climb up the steps to a ledge. There are 2 Treasure Chests guarded 
by a Gigas and an Electric Jellyfish. Kill them, and get the artefact and 
maybe Ring of Light from the two chests.

Then, you can get back to the second area through the tunnel. 

Continue to the right here. There is a Gigas, with 2 Sonic Bats and a 
Cockatrice here. They seem to be guarding a chest. Kill them and open the 
chest. There may be a design for a valiant weapon inside the chest. Continue 
to the right of this area. In the following passage, there will be an 
Electric Jellyfish holding a Stone of Life, as well as a Cockatrice. Then, 
you will come to an area with several pools of water. While you are fighting 
the Cockatrice, two more Sahagins will ambush you by jumping out of the 
pools of water. Kill them and go down the stairs. You will find another 
Cockatrice with two Sahagins here.  The Cockatrice holds a Stone of Clear. 
One of the Sahagins has a stone of Cure. Do not go through the passage 
leading southwest, as it leads to the first Blazer Beetle. Instead, go 
right and up the steps.

You will end up in another area with 3 pools of water. This time, 3 Sahagins 
will ambush your character. Each of them holds a food item, so it is 
worthwhile to kill them all. Climb up the steps. You will come to another 
pool of water, and 2 Sahagins will jump out, one after the other. Surprise! 
With them killed, continue northwest. You will come to a junction, with 
a Sonic Bat holding a plume of Phoenix down and another Cockatrice. With 
them killed. Go north first.

You will be in another large room. There is another path leading to the 
left, but don't go there yet. Instead, go north, and you will find a treasure 
chest guarded by an Electric Jellyfish, a Cockatrice and a Sahagin. Kill 
the guards and open the chest. There is another artefact inside. With this 
artefact, go south, then west. You will come to another harmonic gate. 
Kill the Gigas, Sonic Bat, Electric Jellyfish and Cockatrice first, but 
do not open the gate yet. Instead, go east, along the passage, killing 
the Cockatrices as you go. You will reach a Wind Hot Spot. Place the crystal 
chalice onto the hotspot, and change its element to wind. Then, go back 
to the gate, and play some sweet melodies with your focus attacks to open 
up the gate. You are getting closer and closer to the boss of this level 
now. Go through the gate and when you are ready, go through the tunnel.

You enter a large cave, and then you will see your character ready his/her 
weapon. Why? This is because, there is a giant Cave Worm blocking the way. 
Behind the Cave Worm, you can see daylight, so that must be where the Myrrh 
Tree is. The Cave Worm obviously does not like intruders, and he roars 
a few times. Then, in an attempt to scare you away, the Cave Worm will 
sway left to right, hitting the walls of the cave as he goes, and lots 
of debris will fall down near your character, but your character does not 
budge at all. The Cave Worm then jumps up one more time, and letting out 
some orange smoke, and then he will land back onto the ground, letting 
loose more debris. He lets out a final roar, and the fight is on, as the 
screen shatters. Let's fight!

---------------
Boss Battle
---------------
Boss: Cave Worm
HP: 500
Attacks:
Harmful Brown Gas Spray
Side to Side Sway
Slow Bubble (Slows)
High Jump Ground Stomp (If HP<250)
Resistance: Cold
Minions: 2 Electric Jellyfish
Useful Item: Wind Crystal (~218 points)
Recommended Equipment: Crystal Chalice with Wind Element or Thunder Badge
You are now up against the guardian of the Myrrh Tree of Selepation Cave. 
The Cave Worm is a very big worm with 4 feathery flaps covering his big 
circular mouth. He is aided by 2 Electric Jellyfish. Of course, direct 
physical contact is not recommended with the Electric Jellyfish, as you 
will end up having an electric shock while fighting them. To prevent this 
from happening, it is vital that your character has some protection from 
lightning attacks. This is where the Thunderbadge or the Wind Element comes 
in. Then, it will not be very hard for your character to run up to the 
Electric Jellyfish and kill them in a couple of hits. Then, you can turn 
your attention to the Cave Worm.

(I know, it is possible to kill the electric jellyfish with spells, but 
I just won't bother. This is because, while you are charging the spell, 
the Cave Worm just might suck you into him, making it difficult to aim 
at the Electric Jellyfish accurately.)

Now, the Cave Worm really is a tough one to beat. First of all, he has 
a massive 500 HP at the third cycle and beyond, which means that characters 
with a weak strength and magic just won't cut it out in this battle, and 
would have to fight a very long and enduring battle of attrition. Yes, 
battle of attrition is not a very fun game, particularly that you will 
have to use countless Phoenix Downs to stay alive.

Now, on to the attacks. At close and medium range, the Cave Worm will let 
out some brown smoke at your character, and that deals a lot of damage 
to you. Maybe he is trying to excrete his poison waste at you! This is 
just hard for your character to avoid, as the Cave Worm will sway his body 
to the left and right to ensure even distribution of smoke in almost all 
directions. You can tell that he is about to use this move when he sorts 
of holding his breath for a mere second. Then run to the side. It seems 
that as wide as the attack may seem, there is still a blind spot to the 
left or right of the Cave Worm while he is swing his head round and round. 
You can take advantage of that blind spot and run into it, and then you 
can deal a couple of free hits on the Cave Worm while he is doing so.

On the other hand, if you start outwitting the Cave Worm with the above 
strategy, he will just get annoyed and do a more practical and more accurate 
approach to things his way. Remember the cut scene where he sways side 
to side, knocking debris down from the ceiling? That is what the Cave Worm 
will do. This time, it will cover the entire wide angle right in front 
of the Cave Worm, which means it cannot be outwitted. Besides, the swaying 
action of the Cave Worm will create some sort of a shockwave in the areas 
right in front of the Cave Worm. Which means that you may be hit even if 
you are not touching the Cave Worm at all. This move deals the same damage 
as the brown cloud attack. Whenever you see the Cave Worm's body shifting 
to the left or right, it is time to run back.

The Cave Worm, like the Malboro, is a stationary boss. His attacks lack 
in range. Maybe it is because he is stuck between the walls of that narrow 
tunnel that leads to the daylight. Therefore, whenever you are wounded, 
you can always retreat to the opposite end of the arena to heal yourself, 
provided that you can outsmart the Electric Jellyfish before hand. Of 
course, you don't need to worry about them if you have already taken them 
out in the first place.

Of course, the Cave Worm is not stupid. He has only one long range attack, 
and it does not deal you any damage, and is easy to avoid. It is his slow 
bubble, that can slow your character down when hit. It is simply a ballistic 
attack, and will not lock onto your character like that of the Giant Crab. 
If you are slowed down, immediately cast Clear on the character. As he/she 
is just so far away, it won't be difficult to do so.

The Cave Worm, like the Malboro can suck in air in an attempt to draw your 
character close to him. The good thing is that, even if you are sucked, 
you will not be sucked into the Cave Worm's mouth and eaten alive. You 
will just be sucked into the body of the Cave Worm. As the Cave Worm cannot 
damage you with this move, you can treat it as a bonus and land a couple 
more free hits on the Cave Worm while he is at it. Then run back as he 
is about to sway side to side again to avoid damage.

The Cave Worm, like many other bosses, has his own desperation move. When 
he has less than 250 HP, he will repeat one of the actions in the cutscene 
by jumping up, then landing down, releasing a large shockwave. This move 
really is devastating. To give you an impression on how damaging it is, 
I once has a character with 76 defense getting hit by the attack, and then, 
2 and a half hearts were taken off him. Which means, for the average player, 
this move might be their undoing! You can tell that the Cave Worm is ready 
to perform this move when he jumps up 7 feet into the air. Once he is airborne, 
retreat! Run away as fast as your legs can carry you. Or suffer the 
consequences of this large hit.

In conclusion, the Cave Worm is a monster with a lot of lethal close quarter 
attacks, but lacks in range. Therefore, if you are really the coward that 
you are, you can always play it safe by fusing 2 stones of Fire or 2 stones 
of Thunder together, then use the fused spell on him. No, you cannot use 
Blizzara on him, as he is immune to it. If you can, use the third level 
spells on him, and you can hit him from an even longer range, without any 
fears of damage. The Cave Worm is not versatile due to his immobile nature. 
You can also run in, hit him a couple of times, then retreat, and repeat.

Regardless of which method you choose to adopt, it will be a long and tough 
boss battle. Eventually, all the 500 HP from the Cave Worm will be drained. 
He will make a last cry in pain, and he will collapse, and start to shrivel 
up. He melts in a pile of green slime and giving out lots of steam. Man, 
that's hot. He also reveals a tunnel that leads to daylight. Light, finally 
you can see light.

It seems that the tunnel also leads to a Myrrh Tree. Your character will 
walk over to the Myrrh Tree, overlooking a lovely view of the blue sea 
below, and place the chalice on the pedestal, and let the drop of myrrh 
drip into the Chalice. That's another third of the Crystal Chalice Filled. 
As usual, Mail Moogle will come and deliver letters to all the members 
currently in the field.

*****TWO PLAYER STRATEGY*****
With 2 people, the Cave Worm can become rather difficult at times. This 
is true particularly when he sucks all of you towards him. You are forced 
to follow through as the chalice will be sucked in as well. However, this 
also means that the 2 Electric Jellyfish will have a hard time targeting 
you. Assuming that you have the Wind element, so you can just move in and 
slash them both down before engaging the Cave Worm.

The Cave Worm is yet another stationary enemy in the game. It cannot move, 
and its attacks tend to sweep from side to side. So, I suggest both players 
should focus on one side of the Cave Worm at the same time. For instance, 
if the Cave Worm is about to shoot out his brown gas to the left, run to 
the far right and slash him together. If you are feeling insecure, or a 
little unconfident, then just use ranged Focus Attacks and spells. 

Things will be a lot tougher once you take away half of the Cave Worm's 
HP. After all, his ground stomp attack has a very large area effect, and 
can still create a dent in the health of a character with over 80 Defense! 
So, you better think about running back as soon as the Cave Worm goes up. 
If you are too much of a wimp, cast Fira or Thundara at him from a distance 
again and again, and let the area effect of the spell kill it off.

---------------
Artifact List
---------------
Then, you will be shown the item selection screen. You will be given the 
bonus points, and will get to select up to 8 items, as usual. This is the 
only stage where you can get the Thunder Ring, the magicite ring that allows 
you to cast Thunder at any time. If you get a high enough score, say about 
218 points, you will get to select the Wind Crystal from the item selection 
screen. The Wind Crystal is good if you are a Selkie, because it allows 
you to craft the Thief's Emblem, or forge the Lunar Weapon, the mightiest 
weapon that a Selkie can wield. 

Set 1 (Ogrekiller, Dragon's Whisker, Buckler, Chocobo Pocket*):
This most likely will be the first artifact set your characters will come 
across in Selepation Cave. Just do as badly in Cycle 1 as possible and 
the set is yours for the taking.

Set 2 (Ashura, Rune Bell, Silver Spectacles, Thunder Ring*):
This is the better of the 2 sets which are unique to Cycle 1, after all,

games and 270 for 4 player games.

Set 8 (Ogrekiller, Wonder Bangle, Protection Ring*):
This is the "power set" of Cycle 3. To get it, score around 250 points 
for single player games, 270 for 2 player games, 300 for 3 player games 
and 330 for 4 player games.

With the item chosen, it is time to get out of this damp place and out 
in the open for a breath of fresh air. Whew...

------------------------------
iii. Daemon's Court [FFCC4C3]
------------------------------
Type of Area: Level

Like before, the woman who sung the opening theme will brief you on the 
level. She was told not to underestimate a monster by an old man who has 
a lot of crystal caravans under his command. She was grateful for his 
counsel, but since then she has seen things that surpassed her worst fears. 
She hopes that old man was only speaking about the Daemon's Court. If not, 
she couldn't imagine what greater horror awaits her. This is place really 
has a lot of horror waiting for you, as there are these enemies present.

---------------
Enemies
---------------
Lizard Soldier
HP: 45
Attacks: 
Dagger Slash (Dagger Wielding Lizardmen)
Mace Bash (Mace Wielding Lizardmen)
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Slow, Paralysis
Well, this is what you get when you cross Lizards with men, Lizardmen! 
The Lizard Soldiers of the Daemon's Court are black in colour, and they 
make hissing sounds of lizards, and they all wear a grey suit of armor, 
and has spines like those of Stegosauruses. There are two types of Lizard 
Soldiers here. There are ones which carry a dagger with them, and will 
chop you with them, there are others who carry a mace with 4 spikes, and 
will bash you hard, and stunning you at the same time. The latter type 
are more dangerous than the former type. Fortunately, all Lizard Soldiers 
are vulnerable to cold, which means you can always surprise them from behind 
by a well placed Blizzara or Blizzaga, and then they can suffer the pain. 
Hit and run tactics also work fine against these freaks, as they can only 
attack in close quarters with their blunt objects. Lizard Soldiers have 
8 more HP than the Lizardmen, maybe because these are soldiers, while those 
are just mercenaries, hired hands!

Lizard Wizard:
HP: 45
Attacks: 
Fire
Fira
Thunder
Blizzard
Slow
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Slow, Paralysis
The Lizard Wizard are just Lizardmen, but they are trained with the ability 
to cast spells, while the standard Lizardmen are there for close quarters 
combat. Lizard Wizards, like the normal Lizardmen are black in the Daemon's 
Court. They are harder to distinguish than the Lizardman, as they really 
have not many differences in appearance. The only difference is that they 
carry a magic staff with them. Lizard Wizards have 8 more Hp than the 
Lizardman Mage. The Lizard Wizard (boy, their name really is catchy, the 
two words rhyme!) casts quite a lot of spells. He casts all the conventional 
spells, as well as the powerful Fira move. The Fira spell has a wider radius 
and can hit you multiple times, so beware. Otherwise, you can just let 
him aim at you, and then you can run at the Lizardman during the long delay 
and waste him. Yes, regardless of what monsters they are, all the mages 
are pretty vulnerable on their own, when no front line soldiers are 
supporting them.

Killer Bee:
HP: 15
Attack:
Air Tackle
Vulnerability: Gravity
Resistance: All attacks when airborne
The Killer Bee is yet another tiny little creepy crawly that can prove 
to be just as an annoyance to those Bats around. They are golden yellow 
in colour, they have white wings and a very long stinger. Fortunately these 
guys do not sting you. Instead, they will just ram into you with their 
air tackles. Although this does little damage, it can knock your character 
back, which is rather annoying at times. Like all other flying enemies, 
they are very resistant to all attacks while they are flying. Therefore, 
you can always use a single Gravity Spell to bring them down onto the ground 
before you start bashing them silly.

Lizard Skirmisher:
HP: 37
Attacks: 
Spear Throw
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Slow, Paralysis
Do you know what a Skirmisher is? A skirmisher is a soldier in the army 
that throws spears at the enemy. They are often used with archers in battle. 
The Lizard Skirmishers are just the type of Lizardman who is always holding 
a spear in their hands. The Lizard Skirmishers in the Daemon's Court are 
black in colour, much like their infantry counterparts. Of course, Lizard 
Skirmishers always attack by throwing spears at you. The spears definitely 
have a much longer range than the close combat weapons of the other 
Lizardmen. Most of the time, Lizardman Skirmishers do not work alone. They 
are often teamed up with other Lizardmen. Whenever a whole group attacks, 
the Lizard Skirmishers often stay behind the ranks to throw their spears 
at you while the Lizardmen cover them. This makes the Skirmishers very 
annoying enemies. But once the vanguard is destroyed, the Lizard 
Skirmishers are rather helpless. All it takes is some hit and running to 
bring these lizard artillery units down.

Lizard Warrior:
HP: 75
Attacks:
Mace Bash 
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Slow, Paralysis
I have just figured out, that many armies of enemies in the game are quite 
analogous to each other. The Goblins have the normal Goblin, the Goblin 
Mage and the Goblin Chieftain. The Lizards on the other hand, have the 
Lizardmen, the Lizard Mage, the Lizard Skirmishers and the Lizard Captain. 
The Lizard Warrior is well, analogous to the Goblin Chieftain. The Lizard 
Captain is actually a giant Lizardman. Like the lower ranked Lizardmen, 
Lizard Warriors are black in colour. Most of the time, the Lizardman Warrior 
will simply bash you with his mace, knocking you back, dealing more damage 
than the typical Lizardman. This time, the Lizard Warriors of Daemon Court 
cannot cast Curses on your characters, and hence you can be much safer 
in taking them out from a distance. Therefore, the element of surprise 
is the most important when you have to face these giant monsters. The Lizard 
Warriors are vulnerable to cold, which means blizzard is a good choice, 
they can also be frozen in by Blizzara or Blizzaga. This is how you can 
ambush them from a range.

Fire Bomb:
HP: 30
Attacks:
Airborne Tackle
Fire
Meteor Strike
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Lightning
Resistance: Fire
Useful Items: Magma Rock, Flame Craft, Design for Flame Armor
The Fire Bomb is well, some sort of black sphere like creature with flames 
as hair, and two pairs of evil looking eyes. These enemies are nothing 
but an annoyance, and usually will not pose too much of a threat to you. 
When you are up close to them, they may just swing back and attempt to 
ram into your character. The Fire Bomb knows two different spells. They 
can cast Fire on your character, or even worse, perform a Meteor Strike 
on you! The Meteor Strike is denoted by a pinkish red coloured targeting 
ring with a black circle in the center. When the attack is released, a 
large meteor will drop down from the sky, and onto the targeting ring. 
This move works indoors as well. The meteor strike can do considerable 
damage to your character. Fortunately it has a long delay, and you can 
easily run away from the ring long before the meteor is released upon thee. 
Although the Fire Bomb is vulnerable to cold and lightning, normal physical 
attacks will do. Although the Fire Bomb may be hard to hit while it is 
casting a spell, as it will float rather high up. Once a Fire Bomb is 
destroyed, it will self destruct, burning any enemies or you that appear 
to come too close. You can take advantage of this and destroy a Fire Bomb 
in the middle of a group of enemies and let them all take damage at once. 
Just get out of the proximity before the explosion. Once a Fire Bomb dies, 
it may drop a magma rock, a flame craft or a design for flame armor. Therefore, 
if you are after anti-flame protection devices, you should always go after 
those Fire Bombs.

Wraith:
HP: 50
Attacks:
Blue Staff Poke
Slow
Vulnerabilities: Holy
Resistance: All attacks when invisible
Wraiths are some invisible beings which look like mages with brown pointed 
hats holding a blue staff. Although the Wraith has only one attack, that 
attack is not to be underestimated. The Blue Staff Poke can deal quite 
a lot of damage to anything that it hits. The Wraith is quite tough, not 
only it has a high HP, it is invisible. Therefore, you must reveal these 
enemies with a single Holy spell before you can even think about attacking 
him. The Wraiths are particularly vulnerable when they are casting Slow, 
due to their long delay. Only move in then.

Coeurl:
HP: 50
Attacks:
Claw Swipe
Whisker Slam
Fire
Thunder
Thundara
Blizzard
Slow
Resistance: Gravity
Useful Item: Coeurl Whisker
The Coeurl is some kind of a dog with two long whiskers on its face, and 
a long tail. The Coeurl is yellow in colour and makes the sounds that a 
dog makes. Is that clear? At close range, a Coeurl will simply resort to 
physical attacks, where he can swipe you with his claws as well as slam 
you with his whiskers. The latter attack can knock your character back. 
This is not all, the Coeurl is actually a dog that can cast lots of different 
spells. It can cast Fire, Thunder, Thundara, Blizzard and Slow. The 
Thundara is quite troublesome at times, but all magic spells are easy to 
avoid. Whenever it is casting those spells, the Coeurls will suffer from 
a very long delay. That is when they are especially vulnerable. Although 
Coeurls are resistant to gravity, no one will bother to use it anyway, 
so there is nothing to worry about. The Coeurl cannot suffer from status 
ailments, regardless of what spell you choose. Therefore, physical attacks 
are the most effective against these dogs with whiskers. When a Coeurl 
dies, it may leave behind its whisker, which can be used to craft the 
Wizard's Soul, Charm of Wisdom and the Rune Shield.

Walkthrough
---------------
As soon as you start, get onto the platform right in front of you and fight 
the Lizard Warrior. He is a tough cookie, with 75 HP, but if you can hit 
and run, he should not be too hard to defeat. (You can also launch some 
rocks at him from the catapult there. Hit the catapult with your weapon 
to launch.) The Lizard Warrior should be holding a stone of Fire. Then, 
get down the right side of the stage and continue to the right. You will 
find a treasure chest. Inside, is a stone of Blizzard. I know, there are 
killer bees and wraiths over there, but I will not both with them yet because 
you do not have any stones of Life. Therefore, go to the left, past the 
gate with the two pedestals. You will find the boss inside there, behind 
the gate. The objective of this level is to find the 2 keys which open 
that gate.

To the left of the gate, you will find a Coeurl, and a Killer Bee. Use 
the Gravity to ground the Killer Bee, and kill the Coeurl with normal 
physical attacks. The Coeurl holds a stone of Cure. Now you can heal 
yourselves. Continue going north, and you will find another stage with 
another Lizard Warrior on top. I guess that is one of the command posts 
of this level. Go up and kill him as before. He holds another stone of 
Blizzard, which means you can cast Blizzara now. To the north of the stand 
is another Coeurl with a Wraith beside him. As you do not have life yet, 
do not go and engage them yet. Instead, climb up the stairs to the walkway 
to the right. Go south, and kill the Lizard Wizard. He holds a barrel of 
strange liquid on him. Then go and open the chest behind him. There's a 
stone of Cure inside. Hm... still no stone of Life. Anyway, go back down 
the stairs to the ground, and go to the southwestern corner of the level 
and climb up the stairs to the ledge above. (Kill the lizard soldier in 
the way if he is annoying you.)

On the ledge, you may meet a Lizard Skirmisher that is yellow in colour, 
instead of the usual black. This is an indication that he is holding 
something special. When you kill him, he will drop a key. This is one of 
the keys that can unlock the gate near the starting point of this level. 
Carry the key all the way back and place it on one of the pedestals. With 
the key placed, go back to the walkway and continue your way. You will 
first meet a Lizard Soldier supported by a Lizard Skirmisher. Surprise 
them from behind and you should not be damaged at all. The Lizard Skirmisher 
holds food, while you will find money on the soldier. Then continue you 
way along the ledge. There is then a Lizard Warrior supported by a Lizard 
Wizard. The same sneak attack techniques can be used against those two, 
and the Lizard Wizard (catching!) will drop another stone of Thunder for 
your use. It seems that those two lizards are guarding a treasure chest. 
Open it. There is an artifact inside for you to get.

Now, get back down to the ground, and go back to the right side of this 
level, avoiding all the Wraiths for the time being. As you go right, hug 
the wall of the central building, and you will find a set of stairs to 
the right side of the building. Go up the steps. Kill the Lizard Wizard 
and the Lizard Soldier. There are 2 treasure chests to be opened here. 
The northern one has a plume of Phoenix Down, while the lower one has a 
stone of Life. You can finally cast Holy! It's time to go down and show 
the Wraiths who's boss. Kill the Killer Bees, Coeurls and Wraiths that 
hang around below and grab their items. One of the Wraiths will be holding 
another stone of Life. Have your friend get it if you are playing a 
multiplayer game. The other Wraith holds a plume of Phoenix Down. Then 
go north. There is a treasure chest to the left of the stage. It contains 
money. Then climb up the steps to the stage and fight the Lizard Warrior. 
This time, he will drop a stone of Thunder when he dies. With the Lizard 
Warrior killed this area is clear. Go back down onto the ground and cross 
the southern bridge. The northern bridge cannot be crossed as it is being 
hogged by a Fire Bomb. The selfish brat.

Once you get across the bridge, you will be confronted by a yellow lizard 
skirmisher, a wraith and a killer bee. This means, you will have to cast 
gravity and holy all at once! Use hit and run if necessary. You can also 
fight behind the flight of steps there to the southeast to avoid the spears. 
The yellow lizard skirmisher will hold the second key to the building in 
the center. Take it and place it on the pedestal to unlock the second lock, 
and the gate will rise, allowing you to go in and fight the boss. But do 
not enter yet. There are still areas to be explored. Besides, the positions 
of the yellow lizard skirmishers are totally randomized, so they may not 
be where I stated them to be.

Anyway, climb up the stairs to the right after you have killed the 3. You 
will come to another ledge.  You will first encounter a lizard soldier 
with a lizard wizard. They both hold money, and nothing else. Continue 
to the north. You will find a Lizard Warrior with a Lizard Skirmisher. 
Kill them using sneaky tactics as mentioned before. The Lizard Skirmisher 
will have money in his hands. When they are dead, open the treasure chest 
they were guarding. There is another artifact inside.

Then, get back down to the ground, and get to the north. You will find 
a Coeurl as well as the Fire Bomb on the bridge. Kill the two. When the 
Fire Bomb explodes, it will take that bridge away with it. The logs will 
fly everywhere, and well, what' the point. There is a set of stairs in 
front of your character. Go up.

You will find yourself on another ledge up there. Go left, and you will 
be confronted by another Lizard Soldier, as you are fighting him, his two 
mates to the left would have heard you fight, and will come after you as 
well. The two are a Lizard Warrior and a Lizard Skirmisher. If you find 
things too tough, you can retreat to the stairs, but take note that the 
stairs cannot withstand the weigh of you and the warrior at once, and will 
tilt, sending all of you sliding down below when they are all standing 
on the stairs. With them gone, continue to the left.

You will come to a treasure chest, but as you approach it, you will be 
confronted by another Lizard Warrior, Lizard Soldier and Lizard Skirmisher. 
You had better run back to the stairs and try to pick them off one by one, 
after all, they saw you first. The Lizard Skirmisher may hold food. Once 
they are dead, the treasure chest is yours. There is another artifact inside 
for your to collect.

Continue to the left, you will run past a set of stairs, and then you will 
be confronted by a Lizard Soldier and a Lizard Skirmisher. Kill them, get 
their money, and open the chest. There may be a design for a victorious 
weapon inside. Now, the ledge is clear, and get back down onto the ground 
via the stairs you see over there.

You can now kill the Wraith and the Coeurl you have skipped just now. The 
Wriath holds another plume of Phoenix Down. I don't think you will ever 
need those catapults.

With those enemies down, the whole Daemon Court is finally clear. Go over 
to the opened gate and into the central building. It is time for the boss 
fight against the Lizardman King.

Your character is now walking inside the arena to what appears to the Roman 
Coliseum style circus of the Daemon's Court. You walk in and stop as you 
hear a growl. Now, out of one of the other doors enters a Coeurl. You then 
hear another growl, another Coeurl enters through another door. The two 
Coeurls then walk in and surround your character. They circle you 
menacingly, and then they make another growl and run over to another gate 
with a grate down. They stand by both sides of the doors, acting like statues, 
and eventually the grate rises, revealing a large and heavily armored 
lizard with a shield in one arm, and a large contraption with several spikes 
in another. The Lizardman King makes a war cry, and the fight is on!

---------------
Boss Battle
---------------
Boss: Lizardman King
HP: 400
Attacks:
Rapid Arm Sweep
Left Arm Spike
Multiple Fire Arrow Attack (Burns)
Multiple Ice Arrow Attack (Freezes)
Resistance: Fire
Minions: 1 Lizard Skirmisher, 2 Coeurls
Useful Item: King's Scale
You are now up against some sort of giant lizard with metallic parts, much 
like a robot. This is the roman coliseum, and hence wild animals are always 
there to assist the home fighter. The two Coeurls you meet will stay with 
their master and fight you, therefore, you should always kill them before 
you fight the Lizardman King. At the same time, a Lizard Skirmisher will 
assist the Lizardman King from the backgrounds. 

See those red switches all around the arena? The Lizard Skirmisher will 
stand on one of them, and will then activate some kind of rolling blade 
out of the ground that will go after your character. Not only your character 
will receive damage when hit, the next hit dealt to him/her will do double 
the usual amount of damage. Therefore, you must avoid the blade at all 
costs. However, the good thing is that the blade is easily detectable. 
If you hear grinding sounds, it means that the blade is coming after you. 
The blade also be used on the Lizard King. You can just lure the blade 
into him, and he will be damaged, and you can deal double damage to him 
the next time you hit him too.

You can also use the blade against the Lizardman King and his subjects. 
Just kill the lizard skirmisher and step on the switch yourself. The blade 
will then move around the stage, and any enemy that gets into the way will 
be killed very quickly. (But they will not be rendered mincemeat, unlike 
doom and other more violent games. Tee hee...)

The Lizardman King's subjects are not very bright. You kill them, and they 
will reappear. Yes, but as long as you stay far away from them, they will 
again, not come after you even if you are hitting their king! Those guys 
must be deaf as doorknobs. Therefore, if all other enemies are out of sight, 
there is a good chance that you can just focus on the Lizardman King. Even 
if you have attracted their attention, they still not be able to come at 
you all at once.

Now, speaking of the Lizardman King, let's have some analysis of his moves, 
and how to avoid them. Firstly, the Lizardman King will attempt to use 
his left arm to spike you. See all those spike on the tip of his left arm? 
One of them will stick out and hit you, resulting in heavy damage. The 
good thing is that this move is also easily detectable. Whenever you see 
the Lizardman withdrawing his left arm, then you know it is time to run 
away. Another thing is that the scope of this move is limited. The Lizardman 
King will swing his arm directly to the area in front of his left arm. 
Which means that if he attempts to use the move while you are hitting him 
from his right side, chances are that it will miss completely and you can 
just continue to bash him with your weapon.

Of course, enemies like the Lizardman King are not always that stupid. 
They, like many other bosses including the Cave Worm that you just fought. 
If you manage to outwit the Lizardman for far too many times, he will just 
get annoyed, and will use both of his arms to sweep around the area in 
front of him. Whenever he does this, then you must run back as there are 
no blind spots to this move. But still, this move only has a little knock 
back and will deal a little damage to your character so it doesn't matter 
a lot, anyway.

The Lizardman King is well suited for long range combat as well. See his 
right hand? There is a shield implanted on it, as well as a multi arrow 
bow that can hold up to 5 arrows at once. They fire the arrows at all 
directions the Lizardman King faces here. The red arrows are fire arrow 
and the blue arrows are the ice arrows. The former will burn you while 
the latter one will freeze you in. You can tell that the Lizardman King 
is about to lower his right arm, with the shield bow thingy parallel to 
the ground. The best way to avoid this is to stay put, and wiggle between 
two arrows as they fly towards you. Running around like a nutcase does 
not help at all.

While you are bashing the Lizardman from the front, he may sometimes go 
into a defensive stance by place his left arm in front of him, perpendicular 
to the ground. You will be in for a treat if that happens. Just run behind 
him and send in the free hits!

After some fighting, the Lizardman King will not be able to take it anymore. 
He spins around in a daze, and will fall to the ground and pass out. The 
screen whitens, and you hear a sizzling sound, I guess he must have molten 
or vaporized or something like that.

Your character will then walk through the gate, to another room in the 
coliseum where the myrrh tree is. The Myrrh with then be collected. Then, 
Mail Moogle will come to you to deliver mail as usual. Receive the mail, 
reply it, and you will get to the Bonus Screen.

*****TWO PLAYER STRATEGY*****
This is really one of the simplest boss battles around here. None of the 
Lizardman King's attacks are that difficult to dodge, and even so, they 
don't deal that much damage to your characters. But first, you MUST 
neutralize the Coeurls and the the Lizard Skirmisher, and they most likely 
will not reappear for a while after you beat them.

Now, on to the Lizardman King. The king is not that difficult to distract. 
All you need is one character constantly bashing him from the front, and 
then he will completely ignore the other character. Use this to your 
advantage. Let the stronger character take all the strain, while the weaker 
one continues to hack him from behind. Ha ha ha! That's mean. I think 
Square-Enix ought to program the A.I. to be aware of ANYTHING that is 
present! If the person in the front is getting injured, have the one behind 
Cure him/her! Simple as that! What a cakewalk!

--------------
Artifact List
--------------
This time, if you get a high enough score, you should be able to get the 
King's Scale in the item selection screen. The King's Scale enables you 
to forge the Gaia Plate from Arneaux. This is the strongest armor in the 
game, and it is reserved exclusively for the Clavats! Wouldn't that be 
cool! If you are a Clavat, then there really is no stopping you from getting 
it, otherwise, you will have to wait a long time for this to appear again.

Set 1 (Loaded Dice, Winged Cap, Buckler, Chocobo Pocket*):
This is the first set of artifacts that are unique to Cycle 1. Just do 
as badly as you can and you can get to choose one of those 4 items.

Set 2 (Shuriken, Wonder Bangle, Silver Spectacles, Moon Pendant*):
This is the second set of artifacts unique to Cycle 1. A bit of challenge 
is needed to get them, as you will have to score about 100 for single player 
games, 110 for 2 player games, 130 for 3 player games and 140 for 4 player 
games.

Set 3 (Maneater, Candy Ring, Rat's Tail, Chocobo Pocket*):
This is the first of the two sets that are common to Cycle 1 and Cycle 
2. To get it in Cycle 1, score about 130 in single player games, 140 in 
2 player games, 160 in 3 player games and 170 in 4 player games. TO get 
it in Cycle 2, just do as badly as possible.

Set 4 (Double Axe, Dragon's Whisker, Sparkling Bracer, Moon Pendant*):
This is the second of the two sets that are common to Cycle 1 and Cycle 
2. To get it in Cycle 1, score about 160 in single player games, 170 in 
2 player games, 200 in 3 player games, 220 in 4 player games. To get it 
in Cycle 2, you will have to score about 100 for single player games, 110 
for 2 player games, 130 for 3 player games and 140 for 4 player games.

Set 5 (Giant's Glove, Rune Bell, Wonder Bangle, Moon Pendant*):
This is the first of the 2 sets which are common to Cycle 2 and Cycle 3. 
To get it in Cycle 2, score about 130 in single player games, 140 in 2 
player games, 160 in 3 player games and 170 in 4 player games. To get it 
in Cycle 3, just do as badly as possible.

Set 6 (Ogrekiller, Dark Matter, Chocobo Pocket*):
This is the second of the 2 sets which are common to Cycle 2 and Cycle 
3. To get it in Cycle 2, score about 160 in single player games, 170 in 
2 player games, 200 in 3 player games, 220 in 4 player games. To get it 
in Cycle 3, you will have to score about 100 for single player games, 110 
for 2 player games, 130 for 3 player games and 140 for 4 player games.

Set 7 (Flametongue, Kris*):
This set is unique to Cycle 3. You may wonder why there are only 2 Artifacts 
in this set. It is because, the design for Diamond Gloves and the King's 
Scale make up the 2 other options here. To get this set, score about 130 
in single player games, 140 in 2 player games, 160 in 3 player games and 
170 in 4 player games.

Set 8 (Ice Brand, Red Slippers, Aegis*):

most powerful Defense Boosting Artifact, the Aegis. To get this set, score 
about 160 in single player games, 170 in 2 player games, 200 in 3 player 
games, 220 in 4 player games.

Well, that concludes our little visit to Daemon's Court, with another third 
of your Chalice filled, it's time to leave this dark and dirty place and 
get back to the World Map.

---------------
Miasma Stream
---------------
There is a single Miasma Stream in the Plains of Fum, to the west of Daemon's 
Court. Make sure you have the proper element before you enter. If your 
elements do not match, you will be in luck if it requires the wind element, 
as you can change the element readily in Selepation Cave, otherwise, you 
may have to ride a boat all the way back to Tipa Peninsula in order to 
change to the correct element! Once you have crossed the stream, you will 
come to the Rebena Plains. However, the next section of the guide will 
cover the Vale of Alfataria. Therefore, if you would like to read the 
strategies for the Rebena Plains, use this search key [FFCC4F]. Otherwise, 
read on to find out more.

------------------------------
d. Vale of Alfitaria [FFCC4D]
------------------------------
The 4th area of the game is Vale of Alfataria. So called because it's a 
region with the name, Alfataria on it. There are a total of 5 areas to 
be explored, and a total of 2 road junctions where you can meet people 
and stuff. The areas include the Miasma Stream you came from, Tida, which 
is a level, a village whose crystal caravan failed to return in time, 
resulting in the deaths of the villagers, and the village falling in ruins. 
There is Alfataria, a large city which is the capital of the Liltian 
conquest generations ago. There is also a Moschet Manor, a large manor 
to the southwest of Alfataria who is resided by a Gigas Lord named Jack 
Moschet and his Lamia wife Maggie. Finally, there is the other miasma stream 
that leads to Veo Lu.

------------------
i. Tida [FFCC4D1]
------------------
Type of Area: Level
Hot Spots: Earth, Wind

You will be again, briefed by the woman. She says that the sun once smiled 
on this village like any other, but one day, their crystal's blessing faded. 
But the villagers were still full of confidence, it is said that none of 
them tried to escape. They still stay there, waiting, for their caravan's 
return. But still, their caravan did not come, and everyone in the village 
died a painful death. After hearing this story, the woman is feeling her 
burden more heavily than ever. As you can see Tida is like Tipa, except 
they have rotated the p for 180 degrees. This is a sickening warning to 
anyone who failed to deliver their myrrh back home in time.

----------------
Enemies
----------------
Gremlin:
HP: 30
Attack:
Hair Ball Smack
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Slow, Paralysis
No, these are not those tiny little fuzzy creatures that cannot stand water. 
The Gremlin is a rather common enemy in Mushroom Forest, but they are not 
much of a threat still. Their only attack, the hair ball attack, does not 
deal too much damage but it has a knockback effect, so you will get stunned 
for a short moment when hit. Gremlins are vulnerable to cold, slow and 
paralysis, therefore, you can always use Blizzard or Thunder on them. Their 
hair ball attack can be spotted as he leans his head backwards. Then, you 
can move out of the way as it so slow and inaccurate. In spite of his 
vulnerabilities, a couple of hits from your weapon should be sufficient 
to kill there little pests.

Hell Plant:
HP: 30
Attack:
Energy Ball Spit
Poison Gas (Poisons)
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Slow, Paralysis
The Hell Plant is another common enemy found in Mushroom Forest, Tida, 
Conall Curach, and many other places. It's amazing that plants can make 
such cries. Most of the time, they attack from a range, by spitting out 
energy balls at you. They make a very distinguishable sound while doing 
so, therefore, it would not be very hard to anticipate and evade their 
attack. Most of the time, Hell Plants will use this attack. But sometimes, 
they can let out poison gas from their mouth which poisons you, of course. 
This attack is also easily detectable, as once they are preparing to unleash 
poison gas, they will always stop attacking for a moment and act as if 
they are holding their breath. You should get out of the way for the time 
being until their have finished releasing the gas. The Hell Plants are 
vulnerable to fire and lightning, but I don't think you will need spells 
to take these stationary enemies down.

Stone Plant (Cycle 2 onwards):
HP: 20
Attack:
Energy Ball Spit
Poison Gas (Poisons)
Vulnerability: Gravity (Only once)
Resistance: All attacks
The Stone Plant is basically a beefed up version of the Hell Plant. But 
still, why would plants be made of stone? I guess Square-Enix must have 
become rather too creative nowadays. Like the Hell Plants, the Stone Plants 
attack from a range, by spitting out energy balls at you. They make a very 
distinguishable sound while doing so, therefore, it would not be very hard 
to anticipate and evade their attack. But if it hits, it deals more damage 
than that of the Hell Plant. Most of the time, Stone Plants will use this 
attack. But sometimes, they can let out poison gas from their mouth which 
poisons you, of course. This attack is also easily detectable, as once 
they are preparing to unleash poison gas, they will always stop attacking 
for a moment and act as if they are holding their breath. You should get 
out of the way for the time being until their have finished releasing the 
gas. I know, Stone Plants are weak against gravity, so use it to sap half 
of its HP before you start to bash them.

Tiny Worm:
HP: 30
Attack:
Tackle
Vulnerability: Fire
Resistance: Lightning
Tiny worms are actually the young versions of the Carrion Worm. They are 
mainly green in colour and they make a hissing sound. These worms are small 
and usually cannot deal too much damage on you. They rely on running over 
to you and tackling you, and that is all. As they have such a low HP, killing 
them will not be a big difficulty for you. Tiny worms are vulnerable to 
fire, but are resistant to lightning, as their older version, the Carrior 
Worm can cast Thunder. Casting Fira is a good way to eliminate several 
Tiny Worms that are bunched up together at once. Let them burn.

Fire Bomb:
HP: 30
Attacks:
Airborne Tackle
Fire
Meteor Strike
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Lightning
Resistance: Fire
Useful Items: Magma Rock, Flame Craft, Design for Flame Armor
The Fire Bomb is well, some sort of black sphere like creature with flames 
as hair, and two pairs of evil looking eyes. These enemies are nothing 
but an annoyance, and usually will not pose too much of a threat to you. 
When you are up close to them, they may just swing back and attempt to 
ram into your character. The Fire Bomb knows two different spells. They 
can cast Fire on your character, or even worse, perform a Meteor Strike 
on you! The Meteor Strike is denoted by a pinkish red coloured targeting 
ring with a black circle in the center. When the attack is released, a 
large meteor will drop down from the sky, and onto the targeting ring. 
This move works indoors as well. The meteor strike can do considerable 
damage to your character. Fortunately it has a long delay, and you can 
easily run away from the ring long before the meteor is released upon thee. 
Although the Fire Bomb is vulnerable to cold and lightning, normal physical 
attacks will do. Although the Fire Bomb may be hard to hit while it is 
casting a spell, as it will float rather high up. Once a Fire Bomb is 
destroyed, it will self destruct, burning any enemies or you that appear 
to come too close. You can take advantage of this and destroy a Fire Bomb 
in the middle of a group of enemies and let them all take damage at once. 
Just get out of the proximity before the explosion. Once a Fire Bomb dies, 
it may drop a magma rock, a flame craft or a design for flame armor. Therefore, 
if you are after anti-flame protection devices, you should always go after 
those Fire Bombs.

Carrion Worm:
HP: 60
Attack:
Tackle
Poison Gas Slam (Poisons)
Thunder
Vulnerability: Fire
Resistance: Lightning
Useful Item: Worm Antenna
Carrion Worms are the adult version of the Tiny Worms. They are mainly 
green in colour, with a reddish brown antenna and they make a hissing sound. 
These worms are small and usually cannot deal too much damage on you. They 
rely on running over to you and tackling you, and that is all. These guys 
are quite a challenge, as they have twice the amount of HP as the carrion 
worms. Carrion Worms can cast Thunder on you, as well as poisoning you 
with gas. You can tell they are preparing to let out the gas when they 
lean their body back. At that time, run back! Tiny worms are vulnerable 
to fire, but are resistant to lightning, as the Carrior Worm can cast 
Thunder. Casting Fira is a good way to eliminate several Tiny Worms and 
Carrion Worms that are bunched up together at once. Let them burn. 
Exterminate them. By the way, Carrion Worms may leave their Worm Antenna 
for you to pick up. The Worm Antenna can be used to make Time Armor and 
Accurate Watches.

Skeleton Mage:
HP: 37
Attacks:
Fire
Thunder
Blizzard
Slow
Curse
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Slow, Paralysis
Skeleton Mages, are well, Skeletons who are mages, in other words, they 
are some skeletons that are trained to cast magic on you. The Skeleton 
Mages are different in appearance from the normal skeletons in the respect 
that they are orange in colour, and they hold a very characteristic magic 
staff, instead of the swords, spears and axes of the normal Skeletons. 
Although the golden rule of magicians in this game is to stay behind the 
soldiers for protection, the Skeleton Mages of Tida seem to work alone 
all the time. Most of the time, you will find them hanging around the place, 
by themselves, unsupported by anyone. This makes them easy targets. Like 
most of the mages, Skeleton Mages like to cast the usual assortment of 
spells, like Fire, Thunder, Blizzard and Slow. However, Skeleton Mages 
can sometimes curse you, halving you stats. Otherwise, these bony mages 
are no match for you. Just watch them fall apart when they die.

Magic Plant (Cycle 2 onwards):
HP: 30
Attacks:
Energy Ball Spit
Fire
Thunder

The Magic Plant is a new type of Hell Plant. Hell Plants are bluish green 
in colour with brightly coloured "wings". It's amazing that plants can 
make such cries. Most of the time, they attack from a range, by spitting 
out energy balls at you. They make a very distinguishable sound while doing 
so, therefore, it would not be very hard to anticipate and evade their 
attack. Most of the time, Hell Plants will use this attack. However, the 
meat of this plant are its magic attacks. All magic attacks are given out 
in a very short delay, which means that by the time you see the targeting 
ring beneath your character's feet, it would be too later. Therefore, you 
must be fast on your feet and use hit and run tactics to outwit this super 
fast plant like creature.

Skeleton (Cycle 2 onwards):
HP: 37
Attacks: 
Weapon Bash
Heavy Weapon Bash
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Cold, Paralysis
Useful Item: Gear
The Skeletons are just well, skeletons, all of them carry a weapon and 
a shield with them to combat. Basically all skeletons like to make use 
of the element of surprise to get you. You will see piles of bones on the 
floor, and then, when you get close, you see them swirl around in a cloud 
and then fuse together to form a skeleton. Then, you will know that they 
are activated when you hear the characteristic ding sound. Skeletons use 
a wide range of weapons. Some use a sword, some use some kind of a pike 
while others will use a battle axe. They will just hit you with their weapon 
most of the time. However, sometimes, they can jump up into the air, and 
deliver a critical hit to you. You can tell as their weapons become red 
while they are doing so, and that is when you should run off. Sometimes, 
the skeletons will go into a defensive stance, and just hold their shield 
up. You can take the time to score a couple of free hits at their backs. 
When they die, Skeletons will be shattered to many pieces, and may leave 
behind a gear, which can be used to craft an Accurate Watch of an Unfaltering 
Watch. Maybe it is because these skeletons are mechanical.

Abbadon (Cycle 2 onwards):
HP: 80
Attacks:
Airborne Double Claw Slash
Supercharged Energy Blast
Curse
Vulnerabilities: Gravity
Resistance: All attacks when airborne
Useful Item: Jagged Scythe
Abbadons are another tough airborne enemy. They look like some giant green 
bug with a few pairs of red wings. Abbadons, being the giant bug that they 
are, tends to pack a punch with both of their attacks, as they are just 
so large! Firstly, the Abbadon can slash you with its gigantic scythes. 
This causes lots of damage, and can be super destructive. Secondly, the 
Abbadon can charge up a large blast of energy and launch it towards the 
ground. This is just as devastating than the former attack. However, the 
latter attack is easier to avoid than the former. Whenever you hear the 
Abbadon's charging sound, you should just run out of the way. The best 
approach will be to cast Gravity to bring him down, right? Unfortunately, 
this is not always a good idea for an Abbadon can also cast a Curse on 
your character, and while he/she is cured, the first two attacks can kill 
him/her in only one hit! I wish you the best of luck in defeating these 
monsters. However, with victory comes the spoils. The Abbadons may 
sometimes drop their Jagger Scythe for your use. It can be used to forge 
the Mighty Weapon.

Walkthrough
---------------
At the start, go to the left, and you will find a Gremlin there. Kill him 
for his milk. Then go left and open the treasure chest for a plume of Phoenix 
Down. Then, you can go to the right. You will see a sign saying, "Welcome 
to Tida, the sunniest village anywhere!" Well, hardly seems true, doesn't 
it? The whole village is in ruins. Then go to the right, there is a Hell 
Plant blocking the way. Kill him for his milk. Then go to the right. You 
will find a path leading north, blocked by a Hell Plant. Kill the plant, 
and then you will find a Skeleton Mage behind, attempting to cast spells 
on you. Hit and run and kill him. With him dead, go north and you will 
find a Wind hot spot. Then, open the treasure chest for a stone of Clear, 
now you can get rid of all status ailments. There is nothing more in this 
dead end, go south and back onto the main path.

There is now a Gremlin in the main path to the right. Kill him and get 
his Stone of Fire. Then you will meet a Carrion Worm. Beware of poisoning. 
When he is dead, he will drop a stone of Cure, now you can heal yourself 
without any trouble. Here the son of a Hell Plant crying? That's right, 
there is another one to the right blocking the way. If you are a wimp, 
you can hide behind the dead tree and cast spells to kill him. Then, continue 
along the path. You will meet a Gremlin and another Carrion Worm. The 
Gremlin is holding a stone of Blizzard, while the Carrion Worm may drop 
a Worm Antenna. Then go on along the road.

Go left, and you will find another Hell Plant. This time, it is holding 
a plume of a Phoenix Down. A Gremlin will come from the left as well, and 
he may hold a piece of jade or a ruby. You should also be prepare to meat 
your first skeleton of Tida. As you may wake those piles of old bones up 
and they will stir and come to life! You will meet another 3 Skeletons 
in the field you will cross. They are armed with all sorts of weapons, 
and one of them will drop a stone of Thunder for your use. You will then 
come to a small bridge, with another Hell Plant blocking the way. It is 
best to hide behind a corner of the bridge and cast spells if you are trying 
to play safe. Then cross the bridge.

Across the bridge, you will encounter two piles of orange bones stirring 
up. That is right, they are of 2 Skeleton Mages. As they are unsupported, 
killing those are as easy as pie. Then go down the slope to the left, and 
you will meet a Gremlin, a Skeleton and 2 Fire Bombs. Take advantage of 
the Fire Bombs and destroy them first. Their self destruction can do a 
lot of damage to the Gremlins. One of the Fire Bombs will drop a key. Carry 
it over to the pedestal, use Fire to destroy the thorn bush and place the 
key onto the Pedestal. The gate opens. Go inside.

Once inside the enclosure, you will be greeted by a Carrion Worm and a 
Gremlin. As you are fighting them, two Skeletons would have come to life! 
Watch out! Use hit and run as a safety precaution. If you have a high defense, 
then it is worth brawling with all these enemies at once. Then go deeper 
into the enclosure. You will find another Gremlin. Fight him and another 
Skeleton will come to life. Kill him as well. But why are there so many 
monsters in here? It is because they are all guarding a treasure chest. 
It had better be worth it... In fact, there is an artifact inside.

With the artifact, get back out and go southeast. Follow the path. You 
will find the stand where the Crystal used to be. Only now the Crystal 
has faded. There are two chests by the stand. One of them holds money, 
the other maybe a design for Holy Armor. That's not all. Notice that house 
by the Crystal? You can enter it by examining it. Inside, is a Moogle House, 
have the Moogle stamp your card. Then get back out.

Return to the first gate and move north. There is a Hell Plant there. Kill 
it. Then continue north. There is a Fire Bomb with 2 Carrion Worms. One 
of the Carrion Worms has the key to the gate. Unlock the gate but do not 
go through yet. Instead, follow the path to the right. The path is guarded 
by 2 Hell Plants. While you are fighting them, a Skeleton will come to 
life behind them and will attempt to save his flowerpot friends. Kill them 
all, and continue to move on. You will then find a Treasure Chest. Walk 
closer and a pile of orange bones will come to life. It's a Skeleton Mage. 
Bring him down and the chest is yours. It contains another artifact. Now 
you can go through the gate to the next area.

You will be in an area with a maze. 

Side Quest! Letter Fetching
Before you go to the right, go to the left to the tree. Examine the tree 
stump. There is a love letter inside. If you show it to the elder of Leuda, 
called Cecil and Leu Tipa a woman who stands by the pier of Leuda, they 
will read it with awe. Asking, could it be? A few years later, when you 
return, Cecil will be at the tree. He says, "He's dead, here's a letter 
to you." You will get another love letter. Your character will write an 
entry in the diary, saying how impressed he is with two loves that can 
never fall apart and so on, and you can buy more items on Leuda.

Now, go to the right, and you will come to a sign. It says, "Three days 
until the caravan returns, let's give them a warm welcome!" Really? I always 
thought the people in this town were too confident in their caravan. Now, 
everyone of them is dead.

The maze is divided into several segments. Each segment is separate by 
another by some sticking vine like substance. Sating Fire or Fira will 
temporarily remove them, but they will grow back. First, open up the center 
path. There is a Carrion Worm in the dead end. Kill him for his money. 
Then, open up the vines to the left. You will find yourself in a segment 
with a Skeleton Mage. Kill him and plow on through the vines to the left. 
The next segment has a Skeleton Mage and a Carrion Worm, both carrying 
food. Go on to the north to reach a dead end. There is a treasure chest 
that may have a Faerie Kit inside.

With the Faerie Kit, go back to the sign, and burn through the vines to 
the right. The next segment is a Y-junction with a Carrion Worm in the 
middle. I suggest you take the lower path. This segment has a single 
Skeleton Mage. He is holding a stone of Thunder. Then continue to the right. 
In the following segment, you will be confronted by another Skeleton Mage 
as you enter. Kill him. See that thorn bush over the pedestal? Burn the 
thorn bush away. The key is somewhere nearby. Go northeast, and you will 
find a Magic Plant with 2 Fire Bombs. Kill them all, and you should find 
the key to the gate on one of the Fire Bombs. Place the key on the pedestal 
and the gate will open. Take a deep breath before entering the enclosure.

Why should you take a deep breath, I will tell you why. It is because, 
there is a "shivers", a Abaddon in there. These flying creatures are just 
super deadly with their airborne attacks. They can kill you in less than 
3 hits! Meanwhile, he is not alone, he is supported by 2 Carrion Worms! 
Watch out! You must act quickly. Destroy the two worms and then use Gravity 
to ground the Abbadon. You most likely will have to ground him twice, as 
he has 80 HP, and can get up before you kill him. After a tough battle, 
you can go and open the treasure chest he had been guarding. There is money 
and maybe a design for an Eternal Sallet. Keep it if you are a Yuke.

Then, get out and burn through the vines to the north. Continue to the 
north until you find two vines. Burn through the right one and go through. 
You will find yourself in a segment with two Skeleton Mages. Kill them 
and get their money. Then, burn through the other vine to face the Carrion 
Worm behind it. Then, go north, and you will find a Skeleton Mage. He is 
holding a stone of Cure, this time. With him dead, burn through the vines 
to the right, and you will find another treasure chest, guarded by a Carrion 
Worm. The chest contains another artifact. Now, you can go back to the 
previous segment and burn through the vines to the left.

You are now in a segment with a Carrion Worm and a Skeleton Mage. Kill 
them and burn through the vines to the southwest. You will find yourself 
in a field. There are just so many Hell Plants and Stone Plants here, that 
I would not be bothered to fight them all. Just go left, along the northern 
edge of the field. Watch out for the Abbadon. You must kill him, as he 
is blocking your way. Continue to the left, and you will find 2 Skeleton 
Mages coming after you. Kill them, and open the chest to the far left. 
There may be a design for a Magic Shield inside. Then, you can cross the 
bridge. You are almost at the boss' door.

ON the other side, there is a Carrion Worm with an Angel Kit. The gate 
to the boss' arena is locked, and the key is on one of the 3 Abbadons here. 
Kill them all. After a tough fight, one of them will give up the key to 
the gate. Place the key on the pedestal, and the gate will open, allowing 
you to go through into what seems to be the town square of the formerly 
happy, shiny village of Tida.

In the boss fight cut scene, the camera first focuses on some strange 
building, with a funny cannot like structure its left side. Your character 
walks into the arena, and looks at this strange building. Suddenly, the 
building suddenly gives out green smoke, and its cannon suddenly opens 
fire. Then, the whole building comes to life and jumps out at you. Its 
"eye" glows red, and then the building leans backward. It's time to fight!

---------------
Boss Battle
---------------
Boss: Armstrong
HP: 400
Attacks:
Needle Storm
Fence Sweep
Poison Gas (Poisons)
Slowness Gas (Slows)
Regular Cannon Barrage
Accursed Cannon Barrage (Curses) (HP <200)
Stopping Cannon Barrage (Paralyzes) (HP <200)
Resistance: Lightning
Minions: 2 Skeleton Mages
Useful Item: Dweomer Spore (~213 points)
No, this is not the first man on the moon. It's just some ugly freaky like 
building, with a chimney as a cannon, and a fence for its arm. The Armstrong 
is supported by 2 Skeleton Mages. Yes, they can be annoying if you have 
to concentrate on Armstrong. Therefore, use hit and run tactics to kill 
them before you face Armstrong man to man, or man to house.

Armstrong the house has a wider variety of attacks, many of them with a 
long range. First, he has the needle storm, where he will simply wind up 
and let out a large number of white needles at your character. This is 
detectable when Armstrong places his fence arm across his chest, and 
needles will come out of his er... mouth on his bulb like head.

If you hit him up close for too long, he will just swing out his fence 
like arm in an attempt to smack you back. This move will always knock your 
character back. Whenever you see Armstrong withdrawing his fence like arm, 
then you will know that you have to run back and avoid it.

Besides, Armstrong will sometimes let out green gas from his mouth which 
is poisonous. This attack is medium range at best. Like many other enemies, 
Armstrong will take a deep breath before he will let out the gas. Whenever 
he is starting to suck in air into his mouth, you will know that he will 
blow out poison gas soon. At that point, you can get behind him and bash 
him while he lets out the gas without worries of retaliation.

There is only one attack that can come out without warning, and is difficult 
to avoid. That attack is the slowness gas. While your character is busy 
bashing him at close range. He may suddenly let out some blue smoke around 
the foundations of the house. This gas will surround Armstrong, and your 
character will just slow down. Even if you are slowed down, don't panic. 
Just continue to hit him until your status ailment is gone.

As you can see from the boss fight cut scene, the chimney of Armstrong 
can be used as a cannon of sorts. In fact, he can always fire some green 
cannon balls out that can do some damage to your character. Fortunately, 
the cannon balls are not homing missiles. Therefore, once he lets out the 
bomb, it won't be difficult to avoid it. Apart from this, you can tell 
if he is going to shoot you with his cannon when he lowers it so that it 
is parallel to the ground.

Armstrong is resistant to lightning, but as it is made of wood, it is quite 
vulnerable to fire. In fact, one single Fire spell can set him alight and 
lower his defense, then your character can deal more damage per hit.

Armstrong, like many other bosses of Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles, 
has his own desperation moves. Whenever his HP drops below half of the 
total, that is 200, Armstrong will start to add new flavors to his 
cannonballs. Sometimes, he will fire purple cannon balls. IF your character 
is hit, he/she will be cursed, and his/her attributes will be cut by half. 
Armstrong can also fire orange cannon balls at you, which can stop time 
around you completely. Making you helpless for a few seconds.

Anyway, after some fighting, Armstrong will eventually be down. He loses 
the last of the energy inside him. He stands stills for a second. Then 
explodes and falls to the ground.

You can now watch as your character collects myrrh from the tree in a 
deserted village. Mail Moogle will come to send mail, and you can reply 
whatever you like. Then, you will be treated to the Item Selection Screen.

*****2 PLAYER STRATEGY*****
The Armstrong battle is another 2 against 3 battle. Basically, all of your 
enemies have problems hitting moving targets accurately, and hence melee 
combat will be advised. First, while the 2 Skeleton Mages are trying to 
cast spells on you, run to each one and dislocate them. Then you can turn 
your attention to our friend Louis Armstrong.

Louis Armstrong is made of wood, and all wooden buildings do have a FIRE 
HAZARD! So coordinate 2 Fire spells and cast Fira on Armstrong. That will 
set him alight. You will notice that Armstrong mainly attacks with 
ballistic moves, so tey really will have an extremely low accuracy. Such 
attacks are only a threat to people who likes to cast spells or focus attacks, 
as they will be standing still a bit too often. So, kiddies, let's play 
Merry-Go-Round the Armstrong house! Run in circles around him, and stopping 
with a couple of hits here and there. There really is almost not a single 
way for Armstrong to hit you, but the occasional fence sweep. If Armstrong 
is put out, light him up again and continue your spinning. Then, you two 
will literally bring the house down!

------------------------
ii. Alfitaria [FFCC4D2]
------------------------
Type of Area: Town
Number of Blacksmiths: 1
Number of Merchants: 1 or 2

Crystal Caravan: Sol Racht/Alan Gyle + 3 others
It is very easy to tell if the other crystal caravan is of Alfitaria. The 
Crystal Caravan from Alfitaria is probably the first caravan you will meet 
in the game. After all, they are the ones who will give you the moogle 
as a present. They are characterized by their royal guard uniforms. At 
first the caravan will be led by Sol Racht, but later, he will just retire, 
and Alan Gyle will take his place. Most of the time, when you meet them 
on the road, they will tell you how horrible it is to be ambushed by a 
random enemy, and they will tell you what attacks they will use, which 
will be recorded in your diary.

So, this is the Liltian Capital of their ancient conquest. There are just 
so many buildings here and so many royal guards on petrol. They may all 
be Lilties, with their height, and their apple stumps sticking out of their 
helmets. Let us explore the town. Go left, first, you will see a Lilty 
woman by a store, and she will say that she has all the food to feed hungry 
travelers like you. That's right. She sells food. Her name is Jona Elsa. 
She only sells meat, fish for 40 gil and Spring Water and Milk for 20 gil. 
If you are a meat lover, feel free to buy some from her. If you go southest 
from her position, you will come down a set of stairs to a dead end, and 
the traveling merchant. He appears every alternate year. His name is Gi 
Lubeh a Selkie, he offers the following items for sale:

*****GI LUBEH THE MERCHANT*****
Bronze	300 gil
Iron	500 gil
Mythril	5000 gil
Bronze Shard	100 gil
Iron Shard	100 gil
Alloy	250 gil
Warrior's Weapon*	300 gil
Iron Armor*	150 gil
Mythril Armor*	300 gil
Mythril Shield*	250 gil
Iron Gloves*	100 gil
Mythril Gloves*	250 gil
Iron Belt*	100 gil
Mythril Belt*	250 gil
Iron Sallet*	100 gil
Mythril Sallet*	250 gil
* = Designs
Anything can be bought from him, but do not buy Mythril, it is a waste 
of money. However, if you do have excess Mythril, you can sell them to 
him for 1250 gil per chunk.

Now, get back up the stairs, and go to the left. You will find another 
set of stairs guarded by two royal guards. Beneath the stairs, in a corner 
to the left is an hidden item. Now, go back to the right, past the bridge 
guarded by the two guards, and you will find Hein Dahl, a blacksmith. He 
specializes in producing special armor. I will tell you what he can make 
later. Go right, and there are just houses here and there. There is another 
flight of steps that leads down. There is a girl down there that says how 
she likes moogles and such. There is a drain to her left. Examine it and 
crawl right in! There is a moogle house inside the sewers. Ew... Get your 
card stamped, and get out of there. 

Interesting Plot!
Some years after you have begun your quest, you will encounter a scene 
on the road where the Black Knight has been killed by a boy named Leon 
Esla. You will find him to the right of the bridge upon entering the city. 
He will say that he is proud to have slain the Black Knight, and he is 
keeping his armor as a souvenir. He also says that his mother will stare 
at the armor every night and may cry! Could the Black Knight be...?

Sidequest! Finding the Princess
If you have talked to the locals you will find that the Princess of Alfitaria 
has disappeared. To bring her back, follow these instructions. There is 
a fancy reward for doing so. You will find a guard that looks different 
from others and he walks around. His name is Knocfelna. Talk to him, and 
he will say that you must save her highness. Then, collect a drop of myrrh. 

After that, go back to Alfitaria and talk to Knocfelna again. Then wait 
until the year number is an odd number. Then, go to Marr's Pass and talk 
to Te Odow the female Selkie. She will say, "I often see a strange maiden 
of late, who could she be?"

Then, collect yet another drop of myrrh. Then, go over to the east bank 
of the Jegon River, and talk to the woman in white. She is the princess 
in disguise. After all, who else could she be with "???" as a name? She 
will say, "You travel with a caravan, do you not? Where could you be heading 
on a ship?" Leave the area back to the world map, and then get back to 
the bank.

Knocfelna will be there again. This time, he has a dog called Diadra with 
him to help him search the princess. Talk to him, he says, "Oh, she went 
in that direction, did she? Good boy, Diadra!" This means that the princess 
has crossed the river over to the Plains of Fum. Then collect another drop 
of myrrh. 

Then, head over to the Fields of Fum and you will find Knocfelna talking 
to the princess. Talk to them both. 

Knocflena: Well yes, but... Can you not see I'm occupied? Kindly keep your 
distance.
???: Of course I'll return. Please, let me be. Oh, good day.

Collect another drop of myrrh. Then, go to Leuda by boat and witness 
Knocfelna arguing with the princess. Talk to both of them.

Knocfelna: Forgive me, your highness, but I'm sworn to protect you. 
???: Just leave me alone!

Then leave, collect another drop of myrrh. Then, return to Leuda and talk 
to the two.

Knocfelna:  Why, look at the people here! Not a single hard worker among 
them!
????: Just let me be!

Then leave and return to Leuda. You will find a cutscene. 

The princess explains why she left the castle to Dowhatty. She was bored 
of her dark castle, and wanted to see the world. She envied the Crystal 
Caravanners, and was amazed by their determination. Dow Hatty encourages 
the princess that she can shine again, and the princess agrees.

Then, return all the way back to Alfataria. There will be another cutscene, 
with people running and dancing to celebrate the princess's return. 

Fiona: Now, now... Settle down, Knocfelna! So they've made it.
Your character bows down in front of Princess Fiona.
Fiona: Welcome, caravanner. My apologies for taking you from your duties.
I simply wish to express my thanks. I have been lucky enough to catch 
glimpses of your journey. I was moved by your devotion to duty and family. 
You've seen many memories on your travels, have you not? I, too, must spin 
something: Peace. IT is my duty as princess to guard it and see that it 
is maintained. I've come to realize that every one of us has a purpose, 
something we are meant to do. It is you who taught me that, crystal 
caravanner. Thank you. I am truly grateful (bows down once) This is but 
a poor token of my gratitude. Please accept it. I pray that your journey 
is a safe one. May you continue to spin fine memories. 

You will be rewarded by the princess, for a sum of 100000 gil!

Note: If 4 players are present, then each will be awarded 100000 gil, making 
a total of 400000 gil! Someone with the pseudonym DragonQuest told me about 
it. (I don't have 4 GBAs, nor my friends have any GC Link Cables, so I 
do not know until he informed me.)

Now, you can get out of this big city, and move on with your quest.

As you can see, Hein Dahl is a blacksmith that can only forge special types 
of armor that protect your character against various types of Status 
Ailments. Some armor can also enhance your character's magic and stuff. 
Here is all the armor he can produce for you.

*****ARMOR FOR ALL*****
Design: Flame Armor
Armor: Flame Mail
Materials: Iron x3, Magma Rock x2, 500 gil
Defense: 24
Additional Effect: Resist Fire +1
Flame Mail is the armor that can protect your character against burning 
when Fire is cast on you. Flame Armor has a defense of 24, which has 2 
more than the Mythril Armor. The design for Flame Armor is very common 
in the game, and are usually found on Fire Bombs and other fire element 
enemies. The same applies for the Magma rocks required. As this armor is 
so cheap to design, you should always get it before you have the Diamond 
Armor. Note that 1 point of Resistance to Fire is not enough to withstand 
Fira or Firaga or any equivalent Fire attacks. For protection against those 
attacks, have your Crystal Chalice bear the Fire Element at the same time 
or equip a Flame Badge at the same time.

Design: Lightning Armor
Armor: Storm Mail
Materials: Iron x3, Thunderball x2, 500 gil
Defense: 24
Additional Effect: Resist Lightning +1
Storm Mail is the armor that can protect your character against electric 
shocks when Thunder is cast on you. Storm Mail has a defense of 24, which 
has 2 more than the Mythril Armor. The design for Lightning Armor is very 
common in the game, and are usually found on Thunder Bombs, Electric 
Jellyfish and other electric element enemies. The same applies for the 
Thunderballs required. As this armor is so cheap to design, you should 
always get it before you have the Diamond Armor. Note that 1 point of 
Resistance to Lightning is not enough to withstand Thundara or Thundaga 
or any equivalent Thunder attacks. For protection against those attacks, 
have your Crystal Chalice bear the Wind Element at the same time or equip 
a Thunder Badge at the same time.

Design: Frost Armor
Armor: Frost Mail
Materials: Iron x3, Chilly Gel x2, 500 gil
Defense: 24
Additional Effect: Resist Cold +1
Frost Mail is the armor that can protect your character against freezing 
when Blizzard is cast on you. Frost Mail has a defense of 24, which has 
2 more than the Mythril Armor. The design for Frost Armor is also very 
common in the game, and are usually found on Ice Bombs, Water Flans and 
other ice element enemies. The same applies for the Chilly Gel required. 
As this armor is so cheap to design, you should always get it before you 
have the Diamond Armor. Note that 1 point of Resistance to Cold is not 
enough to withstand Blizzara or Blizzaga or any equivalent Blizzard attacks. 
For protection against those attacks, have your Crystal Chalice bear the 
Water Element at the same time or equip a Frost Badge at the same time.

Design: Pure Armor
Armor: Blessed Mail
Materials: Mythril x1, Holy Water x1, 500 gil
Defense: 23
Additional Effect: Resist Poison +1
The Blessed Mail is an armor that is fitted with a lot of filters inside 
that purifies any poison that may come in contact with you. Therefore, 
your character will not get poisoned as easily as before. The Blessed Mail 
provides a defense of 23, which is 1 more than Mythril Armor, hence it 
may not be worth it. The design for Pure Armor is found in treasure chests 
all around the world, they can be anywhere. Mythril can be found in the 
Mine of Carthuiges as well as other stronger enemies like Goblin Chieftains. 
Holy Water may be found on Wraiths and maybe Coeurls. This is another cheap 
armor to be forged. Note that stronger poison attacks can still poison 
your character even if you are equipped with this armor. For total 
protection, have 2 points of resistance by wearing a Blue Misanga or maybe 
having a Crystal Chalice bearing the Earth Element.

Design: Holy Armor
Armor: Saintly Mail
Materials: Mythril x1, Heavenly Dust x1, 500 gil
Defense: 23
Additional Effect: Resist Curse +1
Saintly Mail is a sacred armor that allows your character to remain, er... 
heavenly. As they are so saintly and godly, enemies cannot cast Curses 
on you, and regardless of how strong the spell is, it will be automatically 
nullified. Like the rest of them, the Saintly Mail provides a defense of 
23. Heavenly Dust may be found on a Wraith in a Daemon Court. If you do 
not want the trouble, you can just buy some of them from a female merchant 
in Leuda, on Lynari Isle. There is no super Curse, don't worry. If you 
think this armor takes too much space, you can always wear a White Misanga 
instead of this armor.

Design: Time Armor
Armor: Time Mail
Materials: Mythril x1, Worm Antenna x1, 500 gil
Defense: 23
Additional Effect: Resist Slow +1
The Time Mail is an armor that keeps time for your character. It causes 
the space time continuum to remain constant, and hence making your 
character more resistant to the slowing of time, and hence they will be 
harder to slow down. Time Mail requires a Worm Antenna in addition to 
Mythril to be crafted. Worm Antenna, well, is found on a Carrion Worm. 
It is just so easy to find. This is yet another suit of cheap armor. Note 
that moves like Slowga can still have the power to slow your character 
down if they are wearing Time Mail. For total protection, wear an Accurate 
Watch to provide a total of two points of resistance to slow.

Design: Eternal Armor
Armor: Eternal Mail
Materials: Mythril x1, Toad Oil x1, 500 gil
Defense: 23
Additional Effect: Resist Stasis +1
The Eternal Mail is an armor that is even cooler than the Time Mail. This 
armor has the ability to maintain the eternal passage of time. Therefore, 
time cannot be stopped at all, and your character cannot be stopped and 
put in stasis. Like the rest of the non-elemental protection armor, the 
Eternal Mail provides a defense of 23 for your character, which is 1 point 
higher than the Mythril Armor. It's up to you to decide if it is worth 
it. Toad Oil is found on a Gigan Toad, which can be found in wetlands like 
Veo Lu Sluice and Conall Curach. The Gigan Toads are weaker in Veo Lu Sluice, 
and that is where you can go toad hunting. The good news is that, as there 
is only Stop. Wearing this armor can ensure that you can never be put in 
stasis. If you think this piece of armor has taken too much space, wear 
an Unfaltering Watch instead.

Design: Gold Armor
Armor: Gold Mail
Materials: Gold x1, Mythril x1, Shiny Shard x1, 500 gil
Defense: 24
Additional Effect: Resist Stone +1
This gold armor looks just so valuable, and yet Hein Dahl is willing to 
charge you only 500 gil for such expensive armor! Gold Armor is made of 
gold of course. For some strange reason, the designers of this game have 
allowed it to help your character resist Stone with it. In other words, 
you will be less likely to be petrified by enemies when you are wearing 
this armor. The good news is that it provides the same defense as the Flame 
Mail. Therefore, it would be more worthwhile to forge it out for your use. 
However, that is not the end of the story. There still exist some extra 
strong attacks that can petrify you even with this armor. For extra 
protection, have your Crystal Chalice bear the Earth element, or just wear 
an extra gold necklace.

Design: Radiant Armor
Armor: Crystal Mail
Materials: Mythril x1, Tiny Crystal x1, 500 gil
Defense: 24
Additional Effect: Resist Miasma +1
Wow, this armor has the essence of the crystal inside it. Therefore, wearing 
this suit of armor is like having a miniature crystal chalice on you. 
Therefore, your character can resist miasma more than before. To be more 
precise, your character can now venture out to the miasma, and it will 
take a considerably longer time for him/her to receive damage due to the 
miasma. However, I just don't find it very practical though. After all, 
why would one like to venture out into the miasma all the time? But still, 
this armor provides your character with a Defense of 24, which is just 
as good as Flame Armor. For additional protection, wear a Crystal Ring, 
or never leave the Crystal's Aura at all!

*****SHIELDS FOR CLAVATS*****
Design: Flame Shield
Shield: Flame Shield
Materials: Iron x2, Magma Rock x1, 400 gil
Defense: 17
Additional Effect: Resist Fire +1

when Fire is cast on you. Flame Shield has a defense of 17, which has 2 
more than the Mythril Shield. The design for Flame Shield is very common 
in the game, and are usually found on Fire Bombs and other fire element 
enemies. The same applies for the Magma rocks required. As this shield 
is so cheap to design, you should always get it before you have the Diamond 
Shield. Note that 1 point of Resistance to Fire is not enough to withstand 
Fira or Firaga or any equivalent Fire attacks. For protection against those 
attacks, have your Crystal Chalice bear the Fire Element at the same time 
or equip a Flame Badge at the same time.

Design: Lightning Shield
Shield: Storm Shield
Materials: Iron x2, Thunderball x1, 400 gil
Defense: 17

Jellyfish and other electric element enemies. The same applies for the 
Thunderballs required. As this shield is so cheap to design, you should 
always get it before you have the Diamond Shield. Note that 1 point of 
Resistance to Lightning is not enough to withstand Thundara or Thundaga 
or any equivalent Thunder attacks. For protection against those attacks, 
have your Crystal Chalice bear the Wind Element at the same time or equip 
a Thunder Badge at the same time.

2 more than the Mythril Shield. The design for Frost Shield is also very 
common in the game, and are usually found on Ice Bombs, Water Flans and 
other ice element enemies. The same applies for the Chilly Gel required. 
As this shield is so cheap to design, you should always get it before you 
have the Diamond Shield. Note that 1 point of Resistance to Cold is not 
enough to withstand Blizzara or Blizzaga or any equivalent Blizzard attacks. 
For protection against those attacks, have your Crystal Chalice bear the 
Water Element at the same time or equip a Frost Badge at the same time.

Design: Holy Shield
Shield: Saintly Shield
Materials: Mythril x1, Heavenly Dust x1, 400 gil
Defense: 18
Additional Effect: Resist Curse +1
The Clavats are going on a crusade with this one. Saintly Shield is a sacred 
shield that allows your character to remain, er... heavenly. As they are 
so saintly and godly, enemies cannot cast Curses on you, and regardless 
of how strong the spell is, it will be automatically nullified. Unlike 
the rest of them, the Saintly Mail provides a defense of 18. Heavenly Dust 
may be found on a Wraith in a Daemon Court. If you do not want the trouble, 
you can just buy some of them from a female merchant in Leuda, on Lynari 
Isle. There is no super Curse, don't worry. If you think this shield takes 
too much space, you can always wear a White Misanga instead of this shield.

Design: Magic Shield
Shield: Rune Shield
Materials: Bronze x1, Coeurl's Whisker x2, 400 gil
Defense: 18
Additional Effect: Spell Range +20
This is just another proof that the Clavats are the most all rounded tribes 
in the game. They get a decent attack, decent defense, and yet their magic 
abilities can still be upgraded with a single Shield. A Rune Shield, like 
the Saintly Shield will provide your character with 18 Defense, which is 
3 more than the Mythril Shield. You can now cast spells further than before 
with this shield. At the same time, the materials are easy to collect. 
The Coeurl's Whisker can be found on Coeurls in Daemon's Court and the 
Moschet Manor. Feel free to use this armor before you get the Diamond Shield, 
you'll like it! The design is found in the mushroom forest.

*****GAUNTLETS FOR LILTIES***** 
Design: Flame Gloves
Gauntlets: Flame Armlets
Materials: Iron x2, Magma Rock x1, 400 gil

has 2 more than the Mythril Gauntlets. The design for Flame Armlets is 
very common in the game, and are usually found on Fire Bombs and other 
fire element enemies. The same applies for the Magma rocks required. As 
these Armlets are so cheap to design, you should always get them before 
you have the Diamond Armlets. Note that 1 point of Resistance to Fire is 
not enough to withstand Fira or Firaga or any equivalent Fire attacks. 
For protection against those attacks, have your Crystal Chalice bear the 
Fire Element at the same time or equip a Flame Badge at the same time.

Design: Gold Gloves
Gauntlets: Gold Armlets
Materials: Gold x1, Mythril x1, Cockatrice Scale x1, 400 gil
Defense: 18
Additional Effect: Resist Stone +1
The Lilties do have a very good fashion sense. In fact, they don't mind 
wearing gauntlets that are made of gold! Wouldn't it be too heavy for them 
to carry their weapons while doing so? Anyway, the Gold Gloves are specially 
designed gloves that protect your character against turning into stone. 
Along with the Gold and Mythril that can be found in shops, you will need 
a Cockatrice Scale, found on a Cockatrice in the Mine of Carthuiges or 
Selepation Cave. The Gold Gloves provide a defence of 18 for your character. 
Which is 3 more than the Mythril Armor, and hence this is the best armor 
before you obtain the Diamond Armlets. However, that is not the end of 
the story. There still exist some extra strong attacks that can petrify 
you even with this armor. For extra protection, have your Crystal Chalice 
bear the Earth element, or just wear an extra gold necklace.

attacks, have your Crystal Chalice bear the Fire Element at the same time 
or equip a Flame Badge at the same time.

Belt: Storm Sash
Materials: Iron x2, Thunderball x1, 400 gil
Defense: 17

Materials: Mythril x1, Holy Water x1, 400 gil
Defense: 18

Design: Wind Belt
Belt: Winged Belt
Materials: Mythril x1, Griffin's Wing x2, 400 gil
Defense: 18
Additional Effect: Focus Attack Range +20
It's no wonder that the Selkies got the best focus attack in the game. 
Not only they charge Focus Attacks the fastest, they also can have a 
specially designed armor to make them fire their attacks from a longer 
range! This is the whole purpose of the weapon. Like the Blessed Sash, 
the Winged Belt provides a defense of 18 to the character wearing it. 
Therefore, this is the best belt before the Diamond Belt. As it is a winged 
belt, wings must be crafted on the belt. Therefore, you will need 2 
Griffin's Wings, which can be found at River Belle Path or Veo Lu Sluice. 
An easy and powerful belt indeed. The design is very rare, though.

----------------------------
iv. Moschet Manor [FFCC4D4]
----------------------------
Type of Area: Level
Hot Spots: Water, Fire

You will be given a short introduction to the man who owns the Moschet 
Manor by the woman. Apparently, Jack Moschet was starving, he ordered his 
Tonberry Chefs to make dinner for him. But when his wife Maggie, came out 
from her afternoon nap, she was very mad to find the table bare. She asked, 
"How dare you forget my dinner?" Jack Moschet knows that he is in big trouble. 
Then he ordered his chefs to hurry up. But still, the chefs took their 
own time.

---------------
Enemies
---------------
Gargoyle:
HP: 12
Attacks:
Air Tackle
Fire Blast (Burns)
Electric Blast (Shocks)
Ice Blast (Freezes)
Vulnerability: Gravity
Resistance: All Attacks
Someone must have been to the Notre Dame in Paris and stole all their 
monuments there. The Gargoyles are just enemies that stand on their little 
stands in this level. Whenever your character comes close, they will come 
to life and come after you. Most of the time, the Gargoyles will fire a 
blast of fire, electricity or ice at you from a distance. If you go get 
close enough, they can just tackle you with their wings. Of course, 
Gargoyles are statues, and statues are made of stone. This makes them rather 
tough nuts to crack. As they are made of stone, they are resistant towards 
all attacks, with the exception of gravity. Even so, each physical attack 
you perform on it will deal only 1 HP of damage. Fortunately, they only 
have 12 HP, so 12 hits will be all you need to bring these statues down.

Coeurl:
HP: 50
Attacks:
Claw Swipe
Whisker Slam
Fire
Thunder
Thundara
Blizzard
Slow
Resistance: Gravity
Useful Item: Coeurl Whisker
The Coeurl is some kind of a dog with two long whiskers on its face, and 
a long tail. The Coeurl is yellow in colour and makes the sounds that a 
dog makes. Is that clear? At close range, a Coeurl will simply resort to 
physical attacks, where he can swipe you with his claws as well as slam 
you with his whiskers. The latter attack can knock your character back. 
This is not all, the Coeurl is actually a dog that can cast lots of different 
spells. It can cast Fire, Thunder, Thundara, Blizzard and Slow. The 
Thundara is quite troublesome at times, but all magic spells are easy to 
avoid. Whenever it is casting those spells, the Coeurls will suffer from 
a very long delay. That is when they are especially vulnerable. Although 
Coeurls are resistant to gravity, no one will bother to use it anyway, 
so there is nothing to worry about. The Coeurl cannot suffer from status 
ailments, regardless of what spell you choose. Therefore, physical attacks 
are the most effective against these dogs with whiskers. When a Coeurl 
dies, it may leave behind its whisker, which can be used to craft the 
Wizard's Soul, Charm of Wisdom and the Rune Shield.

Ochu (Cycle 3 onwards):
HP: 100
Attacks:
Double Vine Slam
Rapid Spin
Poison Spell (Poisons)
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Slow, Paralysis
Ochus are some sort of plant being with a big mouth and some pink petals 
around. These plant beings, unlike the Hell Plant, are not stationary, 
they can move around to wreck havoc on you. Their high HP makes them 
particularly troublesome. Fortunately these enemies do not have any decent 
ranged attacks. Ochus can only cast poison spells on you. Once you see 
the green targeting ring on the ground, move away and you will be safe 
from poisoning. However, do not let Ochus get too close to you. When you 
are close enough, Ochus can swing their long vine like arms out and slam 
you between them. Or, they can just be a bit aerobic and spin around, 
knocking you back. As Ochus are plants, they are particularly vulnerable 
to fire. So, casting a Fire spell on them to weaken them is not a bad idea 
at all. If in doubt, use projectile focus attacks to keep your distance 
from this oversized plant being.

Gremlin:
HP: 30
Attack:
Hair Ball Smack
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Slow, Paralysis
No, these are not those tiny little fuzzy creatures that cannot stand water. 
The Gremlin is a rather common enemy in Mushroom Forest, but they are not 
much of a threat still. Their only attack, the hair ball attack, does not 
deal too much damage but it has a knockback effect, so you will get stunned 
for a short moment when hit. Gremlins are vulnerable to cold, slow and 
paralysis, therefore, you can always use Blizzard or Thunder on them. Their 
hair ball attack can be spotted as he leans his head backwards. Then, you 
can move out of the way as it so slow and inaccurate. In spite of his 
vulnerabilities, a couple of hits from your weapon should be sufficient 
to kill there little pests.

Tonberry Chef:
HP: 37
Attack:
Knife Chop
Supercharged Knife Chop
Slow
Useful Item: Yellow Feather
Tonberry Chefs are those cooks you see in the opening cut-scene. You can 
easy spot them with their cook's hat. The Tonberry Chefs are always armed 
with choppers. Whenever they spot intruders, they will come over to chop 
you with the chopper. At the same time, they may just super charge the 
move and make a devastating chop. Fortunately, that attack is easily 
detectable and you can get a few free hits in while they are delayed for 
a long time. Once a Tonberry Chef is killed, he will drop a yellow feather, 
which can be used to forge the Chocobo Shield!

---------------
Walkthrough
---------------
That's right, you are to legally break in and enter the manor of a Gigas 
Lord and his Lamia wife. You will begin in the courtyard. There are two 
treasure chests to the left and right of your character. They contain a 
stone of Cure and a Stone of Life. They are both guarded by a Gargoyle. 
As you have no gravity, you will have to hard hit them here. When they 
are down, you can go and get the materials they may be holding. Most likely 
Alloy or Mythril. Then, you can go into the main courtyard. There are a 
couple of guard dogs here, comprised of 2 Coeurls. There is also an Ochu 
that will appear on later cycles. 2 more Gargoyles will stand behind the 
Ochu and will come to their assistance. Put them to sleep now.

Now, that the courtyard's clear. It's time to explore all the rooms in 
Moschet Manor. We will start with the bottom left. Each door is opened 
by a switch to be stepped on. To unlock the door, make sure that the tribal 
symbol on the switches matches the tribe of your character standing on 
it. Is that clear? Good. Let's enter the first room.

The first room is the master's bedroom. Here, the Lamia wife of Jack Moschet 
is here, starring at herself in the mirror. There is no use talking to 
her. She will just ask you to go away. Then, you can go over to the right, 
and open the treasure chest. There may be a fashion kit or a lady's 
accessories design inside. Keep it if your character is female. Otherwise, 
trip the switch and get out. OK?

The next room you are going to visit is the room opposite the master's 
bedroom. It is actually a store room. There is a Tonberry Chef inside, 
along with a Gremlin. One has a stone of Fire, and another has a Stone 
of Blizzard. Kill them and take their loot. Then, open the chest and take 
the artifact from it. Then get out, and enter the room to the north.

The next room is the kitchen. There are 3 Tonberry Chefs with a Coeurl 
inside. Hey, you are not supposed to have dogs in the kitchen! Kill the 
4, and then get out. Enter the room opposite.

This room is the dining room. It is so empty, and there is a single Tonberry 
Chef here. Kill him, go north and open the chest for another artifact. 
Go south, and examine the table. You should find a small hole. Enter, and 
you will be in another Moogle house. Have the resident moogle stamp your 
card, and get out. Then, enter the room to the north.

You are in the library. There are 2 Tonberry Chefs here, along with a chest. 
The chest contains another artifact. You know what to do with the Tonberry 
Chefs, don't you? Get out, and enter the room opposite.

You are in another room with a table and a Fire Hot Spot. There is a Tonberry 
Chef hidden behind the table. Kill him as well. The chest here has money.

Enter the final northernmost room. You must be inside the living room. 
There are two Gargoyles, a Coeurl and a Tonberry Chef in this room. Kill 
them all and get out. It's time for the boss fight.

You will see Jack Moschet the Gigas Lord storm every room of the manor, 
looking for his chefs. He finds them all dead. The ghosts of the chefs 
look at your character. Now, Jack Moschet IS annoyed! It's time to fight!

---------------
Boss Battle
---------------
Boss: Gigas Lord
HP: 400
Attacks: 
Giant Punch
Ground Stomp
Ice Breath (Freezes)
Full Heal (If Maggie is present)
Resistance: Cold
Useful Item: Lords Robe (Uncertain Score)

Minion: Maggie
HP: 125
Attacks:
Dual Fan Smack
Slowga
Stop

You are now up against the owner of the Moschet Manor, Jack Moschet. He 
is so mad that you have killed his cooks that he wants to fight for revenge. 
Go forward and hit him, just once. his wife, Maggie would come and 
intervene.

It is very essential that you knock out Maggie first, as the Gigas Lord 
will just heal himself and Maggie to full health from time to time. Maggie 
is not much of a threat. She just slows you down with Slowga and attempts 
to put you in stasis with Stop. To prevent her from being healed, Run into 
her, and push her away from her husband. Then start bashing her like crazy, 
healing yourself if she smacks you too hard. Eventually, all of her health 
will be depleted, and she will walk to the side and spin around dizzily. 
You can now face the Gigas Lord without any interference at all.

The Gigas Lord attacks just like a normal Gigas, only that his attacks 
are much stronger. His most typical attack is the giant punch, which has 
no knock back. I thought of a way to exploit this move in a multiplayer 
game. One day, I was playing with my cousin, and she had a weaker character. 
I stood my character in front of the Gigas Lord and bashed him. Jack Moschet 
continued to bash me, while my cousin snuck in behind him and bash him. 
Now, the Gigas Lord practically ignored her existence, and just punched 
me while I kept healing myself, and over 200 HP was drained from him this 
way!

Sometimes, the Gigas Lord may be more cautious, and he would jump up in 
the air and stomp down, creating a shockwave. This is one attack that cannot 
be avoided when you are up to him. Finally, the Gigas Lord will resort 
to the Ice Breath that can be countered by a Frost Badge. Easy.

Eventually you will beat the Gigas Lord and he will start bashing the ground 
like a little baby and run off, and his angry wife Maggie will chase him 
out of the house! Now, you can go and collect the Myrrh in the backyard. 
Answer the mail you receive, and you can get to the item selection screen. 

*****TWO PLAYER STRATEGY*****
Now that you have 2 players fighting Jack Moschet and his wife, the playing 
field will be sort of leveled, right? So, let your stronger character go 
after the Gigas Lord, while your weaker one goes after Maggie. Try to keep 
the two separated as much as possible. This is because if the Gigas Lord 
sees his wife injured, he may cure himself and Maggie back to full strength! 
So, keep them apart and distracted. Once Maggie has had enough, it will 
be YOUR ball game! Not Jack's!

As I said from above, I thought of a way to exploit this move in a multiplayer 
game. One day, I was playing with my cousin, and she had a weaker character. 
I stood my character in front of the Gigas Lord and bashed him. Jack Moschet 
continued to bash me, while my cousin snuck in behind him and bash him. 
Now, the Gigas Lord practically ignored her existence, and just punched 
me while I kept healing myself, and over 200 HP was drained from him this 
way! The only thing you have to worry about is his ground stomp attack. 
Otherwise, by exploting this flaw in the A.I., a 2 player game can be rather 
a cakewalk!

---------------

game, I got 38, my cousin got 118, and yet I got to choose the Lords Robe!

--------------
Miasma Stream
--------------
All 4 elements can be found in Vale of Alfataria. Therefore, you can easily 
cross this miasma stream. OK? Once you have crossed the stream, you will 
be at Veo Lu. Read on for the next chapter.

-------------------
e. Veo Lu [FFCC4E]
-------------------
Ah, this is it. You have finally got to the origin of the Jegon River, 
Veo Lu. Veo Lu has some land east to a giant lake named Lake Shella, which 
has a sluice built by Yukes in the time of peace, resulting in the Jegon 
River. There are a total of only 2 areas to be explored here. There is 
the Veo Lu Sluice, the Sluice I mentioned which has been built by Lilties, 
and Shella, a village that is mostly inhabited by Yukes. Ordinary men and 
women cannot just enter Shella, they must bear the mark of Shella, which 
can only be found in the Veo Lu Sluice. Now, let me begin.

---------------------------
i. Veo Lu Sluice [FFCC4E1] 
---------------------------
Type of Area: Level

Again, you will be given a brief history lesson from the woman. Long ago, 
the land gained peace, and Lilties kept the highways safe. Travelers then 
could travel freely on the land without any fear of monsters. Meanwhile, 
Yukes constructed this great sluice that channeled water down from Lake 
Shella into Jegon Creek. The Jegon Creek then became a river, which swept 
downstream to the Plains of Fum, turning it into farmland, and hence the 
world could be assured of an adequate food supply. Therefore, this slice 
really is of enormous economic value to the whole world.

Enemies
---------------
Lizardman
HP: 37
Attacks: 
Dagger Slash (Dagger Wielding Lizardmen)
Mace Bash (Mace Wielding Lizardmen)
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Slow, Paralysis
Well, this is what you get when you cross Lizards with men, Lizardmen! 
The Lizardmen of the Selepation Cave are green in colour, and they make 
hissing sounds of lizards, and they all wear a grey suit of armor, and 
has spines like those of Stegosauruses. There are two types of Lizardmen 
here. There are ones which carry a dagger with them, and will chop you 
with them, there are others who carry a mace with 4 spikes, and will bash 
you hard, and stunning you at the same time. The latter type are more 
dangerous than the former type. Fortunately, all Lizardmen are vulnerable 
to cold, which means you can always surprise them from behind by a well 
placed Blizzara or Blizzaga, and then they can suffer the pain. Hit and 
run tactics also work fine against these freaks, as they can only attack 
in close quarters with their blunt objects.

Lizardman Mage:
HP: 37
Attacks: 
Fire
Fira
Thunder
Blizzard
Slow
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Slow, Paralysis
The Lizardman Mages are just Lizardmen, but they are trained with the 
ability to cast spells, while the standard Lizardmen are there for close 
quarters combat. Lizardman Mages, like the normal Lizardmen are green in 
the Selepation Cave. They are harder to distinguish than the Lizardman, 
as they really have not many differences in appearance. The only difference 
is that they carry a magic staff with them. The Lizardman Mage casts quite 
a lot of spells. He casts all the conventional spell, as well as the powerful 
Fira move. The Fira spell has a wider radius and can hit you multiple times, 
so beware. Otherwise, you can just let him aim at you, and then you can 
run at the Lizardman during the long delay and waste him. Yes, regardless 
of what monsters they are, all the mages are pretty vulnerable on their 
own, when no front line soldiers are supporting them.

Lizard Skirmisher:
HP: 37
Attacks: 
Spear Throw
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Slow, Paralysis
Do you know what a Skirmisher is? A skirmisher is a soldier in the army 
that throws spears at the enemy. They are often used with archers in battle. 
The Lizard Skirmishers are just the type of Lizardman who is always holding 
a spear in their hands. The Lizard Skirmishers in the Selepation Cave are 
green in colour, much like their infantry counterparts. Of course, Lizard 
Skirmishers always attack by throwing spears at you. The spears definitely 
have a much longer range than the close combat weapons of the other 
Lizardmen. Most of the time, Lizardman Skirmishers do not work alone. They 
are often teamed up with other Lizardmen. Whenever a whole group attacks, 
the Lizard Skirmishers often stay behind the ranks to throw their spears 
at you while the Lizardmen cover them. This makes the Skirmishers very 
annoying enemies. But once the vanguard is destroyed, the Lizard 
Skirmishers are rather helpless. All it takes is some hit and running to 
bring these lizard artillery units down.

Lizard Captain:
HP: 37
Attacks:
Dagger Slash (Dagger Wielding Lizard Captains)
Curse
Vulnerabilities: Slow, Paralysis
I have just figured out, that many armies of enemies in the game are quite 
analogous to each other. The Goblins have the normal Goblin, the Goblin 
Mage and the Goblin Chieftain. The Lizards on the other hand, have the 
Lizardmen, the Lizard Mage, the Lizard Skirmishers and the Lizard Captain. 
The Lizard Captain is well, analogous to the Goblin Chieftain. The Lizard 
Captain is actually a giant Lizardman. Like the lower ranked Lizardmen, 
Lizard Captains are green in colour. Most of the time, the Lizardman Captain 
will simply slash you with his larger dagger, dealing more damage than 
the typical Lizardman. However, he is quite dangerous when you are far 
away from him. Instead of running after you, the Lizard Captain will attempt 
to put a Curse on your character, halving their stats before moving in. 
Therefore, the element of surprise is the most important when you have 
to face these giant monsters. Although Lizard Captains are resistant to 
Blizzards, they can still be frozen in by Blizzara or Blizzaga. This is 
how you can ambush them from a range.

Gigan Toad:
HP: 60
Attacks:
Tongue Jab
Blizzard
Blizzara
Vulnerability: Fire
Resistance: Cold
Useful Item: Toad Oil
Gigan Toads are well, giant blue-green amphibians that like to dwell in 
damp environments like Veo Lu Sluice and Conall Curach. They have a blue 
green back with a clear belly. As a water creature, Gigan Toads love to 
use Ice attacks against you. Therefore, a Gigan Toad as the ability to 
use two different kinds of Blizzard Spell. They are Blizzard and Blizzara. 
Both moves share the same targeting ring, with Blizzara having a wider 
radius than Blizzard. It is always better to be safe than sorry, and run 
considerably away from the ring to avoid the area effects. Of course, Gigan 
Toads are not only capable of long range combat. They are also quite good 
at close quarters. If your character is beating them badly up close, they 
will stick out their tongues to jab you. This does considerable damage 
and is capable of knocking your character back. This is detected by the 
toad leaning back and opening its mouth. Then you can take evasive action. 
Gigan Toads are tougher in Conall Curach. There, you must exploit their 
weakness with fire spells. When a Gigan Toad dies, he may drop a vial of 
Toad Oil, which can be used to craft Eternal Armor and Unfaltering Watches, 
accessories and armor that protects your character from ever being put 
on stasis.

Fire Bomb:
HP: 30
Attacks:
Airborne Tackle
Fire
Meteor Strike
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Lightning
Resistance: Fire
Useful Items: Magma Rock, Flame Craft, Design for Flame Armor
The Fire Bomb is well, some sort of black sphere like creature with flames 
as hair, and two pairs of evil looking eyes. These enemies are nothing 
but an annoyance, and usually will not pose too much of a threat to you. 
When you are up close to them, they may just swing back and attempt to 
ram into your character. The Fire Bomb knows two different spells. They 
can cast Fire on your character, or even worse, perform a Meteor Strike 
on you! The Meteor Strike is denoted by a pinkish red coloured targeting 
ring with a black circle in the center. When the attack is released, a 
large meteor will drop down from the sky, and onto the targeting ring. 
This move works indoors as well. The meteor strike can do considerable 
damage to your character. Fortunately it has a long delay, and you can 
easily run away from the ring long before the meteor is released upon thee. 
Although the Fire Bomb is vulnerable to cold and lightning, normal physical 
attacks will do. Although the Fire Bomb may be hard to hit while it is 
casting a spell, as it will float rather high up. Once a Fire Bomb is 
destroyed, it will self destruct, burning any enemies or you that appear 
to come too close. You can take advantage of this and destroy a Fire Bomb 
in the middle of a group of enemies and let them all take damage at once. 
Just get out of the proximity before the explosion. Once a Fire Bomb dies, 
it may drop a magma rock, a flame craft or a design for flame armor. Therefore, 
if you are after anti-flame protection devices, you should always go after 
those Fire Bombs.

Griffin:
HP: 80
Attacks:
Airborne Jump Ballistic Attack
Ground Stomp Shock Wave Attack
Forward Wing Attack
Vulnerability: Fire
Useful Item: Griffin's Wing
This is just a giant bird that seems to be cross bred with a ground animal. 
Although this enemy is a bird, it cannot fly at all. Instead, it is grounded 
at all times. Most of the time, if you stand still and are far away from 
him, the Griffin will make a cry and then soar up into the air, and fire 
a single energy ball at you while airborne, before landing again. If you 
get close to the Griffin, he can attempt to charge you down by stomping 
the ground, creating a shockwave, or by simply hitting you with his wings. 
The former attack can stun you enemy, so be careful. A good idea would 
be to weaken him with a single Fire Spell. That way, you can hurt him more 
per hit. Once he is killed, he may drop his wing (Griffin's Wing), and 
you can take it with you, and use it to craft accessories.

Water Flan:
HP: 35
Attacks:
Headbutt
Blue Slowness Gas (Slows you down)
Vulnerability: Fire
Resistance: Cold
No, these are not those tasty pastries that are a lot like quiches. But, 
there are some blob of blue goo that writhes like quicksilver on the ground. 
They are just another of those annoyances you will find in Veo Lu Sluice. 
They attack by headbutting you with their goop. They also may attempt to 
slow you down by blowing some blue gas out. Otherwise, you can just kill 
them with a couple of hits of your weapon. There is no need to use Fire 
at all, unless you want to waste your time. Of course, Water Flans are 
made of water, unlike the ordinary type. Therefore, they are resistant 
to Cold. When they die, they may drop Chilly Gel, which can be used to 
forge Frost Armor and the Frost Badge.

Ice Bomb:
HP: 37
Attacks:
Airborne Tackle
Blizzard
Meteor Strike
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Lightning
Resistance: Cold
Useful Items: Chilly Gel, Frost Craft, Design for Frost Armor
The Ice Bomb is well, some sort of black sphere like creature with blue 
fumes as hair, and two pairs of evil looking eyes. These enemies are nothing 
but an annoyance, and usually will not pose too much of a threat to you. 
When you are up close to them, they may just swing back and attempt to 
ram into your character. The Ice Bomb knows two different spells. They 
can cast Blizzard on your character, or even worse, perform a Meteor Strike 
on you! The Meteor Strike is denoted by a pinkish red coloured targeting 
ring with a black circle in the center. When the attack is released, a 
large meteor will drop down from the sky, and onto the targeting ring. 
This move works indoors as well. The meteor strike can do considerable 
damage to your character. Fortunately it has a long delay, and you can 
easily run away from the ring long before the meteor is released upon thee. 
Although the Ice Bomb is vulnerable to cold and lightning, normal physical 
attacks will do. The Ice Bomb may be hard to hit while it is casting a 
spell, as it will float rather high up. Once an Ice Bomb is destroyed, 
it will self destruct, freezing any enemies or you that appear to come 
too close. You can take advantage of this and destroy an Ice Bomb in the 
middle of a group of enemies and let them all take damage at once. Just 
get out of the proximity before the explosion. Once an Ice Bomb dies, it 
may drop a blob of Chilly Gel, a frost craft or a design for frost armor. 
Therefore, if you are after anti-cold protection devices, you should always 
go after those Ice Bombs.

---------------
Walkthrough
---------------
As soon as you start, go all the way to the left. There is a treasure chest 
to the left. It contains a plume of Phoenix Down. Then, go south. There 
is a Lizardman with a mace, along with a Gigan Toad. Kill the two and grab 
their magicite. The Lizardman should hold a stone of Cure, while the Gigan 
Toad will be holding a stone of Blizzard. Now, you can heal yourself. Then, 
go south, between the two green lampposts and down south along with path. 
You will meet another Lizardman with his Gigan Toad friend. Kill them both 
and grab their Magicite. The Lizardman will hold a stone of Fire, while 
the Gigan Toad will have a stone of Clear.

See the gate? It's closed and locked. But where is the key? Well, to find 
out, go to the left. Follow the circular path. You will come to a switch, 
guarded by a Gigan Toad, a Griffin and a Lizard Skirmisher. Watch out. 
These three make a very deadly combo. One will attack in close range, one 
will cast Blizzard and one will be the artillery support. If you are playing 
a 2 player game, there will be an extra Ice Bomb with the three. Therefore, 
it is always good to lure them out one by one to take them out without 
their friends' support. When you have killed the trio, go over to the 
treasure chest and open it. There is an artifact inside. The Griffin on 
the other hand, may drop a Shella Mark. You can use it to enter Shella. 
See the wilted plant to the left? It's a pump plant. To revive it, cast 
Life on it. There are a few more wilted pump plants here. When all of them 
are alive, the Jegon River can be refilled. (All the tiny dry lakes will 
also become inaccessible.) Now, step on the switch. A water hole to the 
right would have blasted a key up. Run to the key and catch it. Then you 
can take the key and place it onto the pedestal, and the gate will unlock. 
Now, go through the gate.

As soon as you have gone through, you will have been greeted by a Lizardman 
and a Lizardman Mage. You know what to do. I suggest you use some Blizzard 
to eliminate them more quickly. The Lizardman will drop food while the 
Lizardman Mage will drop a stone of Life. With the stone of Life, you can 
bring all of those dead plants back to life! Now, go to the right, and 
reach a cliff. There is a treasure chest there. Inside, is another artifact. 
Then, go left, and you will find another treasure chest hidden in the trees. 
There is a stone of Thunder inside. Then go south and to the left. There 
is a flight of steps leading down to the lake. If it has not been filled 
up, you can go down and get the treasure chests, otherwise, continue to 
the west.

You will come to another locked gate. The key is conveniently hidden in 
the south. Step on the switch, and as the switch bounces up, go and get 
it. Then place it on the pedestal to unlock the gate. However, do not go 
through, instead, go south, along the path.

You will find a flight of stairs leading to the right. Go down them. You 
will meet a Water Flan along with path. Burn it to death. If you are playing 
a 2 player game, there will be an extra Ice Bomb behind the Water Flan. 
Burn that too if this is so. Then continue to the right. You will meet 
an Ice Bomb, a Lizard Skirmisher and a Gigan Toad. They again make a deadly 
trio around here. IF you have two stones of Fire and Blizzard, then it's 
much easier, as you can use Blizzara against the Lizard Skirmisher, and 
use Fira to engulf both the Gigan Toad and the Ice Bomb. Otherwise, just 
use hit and run tactics to eliminate them. The Gigan Toad, in particular 
will drop a plume of Phoenix Down. Having defeated them all, you will see 
what all the fuss is about. Apparently the three were guarding a treasure 
chest. Inside, is another artifact. Get it, and go back to the main path.

Boy, they are really having a party here in this area. There is a Griffin, 
a Lizard Skirmisher, a Lizardman Mage, an Ice Bomb and a Water Flan hanging 
around together! If you are playing a 2 player game, there will also be 
a Gigan Toad and a Lizardman with the 4 as well! This is going to be tough, 
if you do not have any good sneak attack tricks. The same Blizzara/Fira 
tricks should be used. Otherwise, sneak attack using Focus Attacks. In 
this area, we will find a lot of stones of Magicite on each of the enemies. 
The Lizardman Mage will be carrying a stone of Thunder, the Lizard 
Skirmisher will be carrying a stone of Fire, the Griffin, on the other 
hand, will be carrying a stone of Life.

See the switch? Standing on it will cause another key to splash out of 
the water hole nearby. However, this time, the key will be so far away 
that by the time you have run over to the hole, the key would have sunk. 
Therefore, you will have to use the Crystal Chalice to hold down the switch. 
Once the key springs up, run like mad to the water hole, and grab the key. 
Then let the character drop it as he/she is hurt from the miasma. Then, 
run back to the chalice, and press X to have Mog carry it again. Then, 
go to the key, pick it up, and place it on the pedestal. The gate will 
open. Then, you can go through. Is that clear? Good.

Go to the right along the path, and then to the north at the junction. 
You are very close to the boss now. In this area, we have 4 enemies, 2 
Lizardmen, a Water Flan and a Griffin all quite far away from each other. 
An extra Gigan Toad will be present if it is a 2 player game. The nearest 
Lizardman to the right can be killed without arousing the others. Then, 
sneak up on the Water Flan and attack it. This time, the 2 other enemies 
will come and assist. Hit and run if your stats are low. Then, the Water 
Flan should drop a seed, while the 2 Lizardmen drop food. The Griffin may 
drop another Shella Mark for you.

The key to the boss' arena can be found here. Place the crystal chalice 
onto the switch, and run to the key pick it up and drop it. Run back into 
the Crystal's Aura and then have Mog pick the chalice up. Then you can 
pick the key up and place it on the pedestal. You can fight the boss anytime 
now. But do not do so yet. There is still something else of interest in 
this stage.

See the path to the north of the gate? Go north, along the path. Follow 
the circular path round the lake, and kill the Gigan Toad (and the Lizardman 
if it's a 2 player game) in the way. Then continue your way until you reach 
a junction. There is a Water Flan there. To the north, there is a Lizardman 
Mage with a Griffin. The 3 most likely will attempt to surround you at 
once. Use Fira against them all for the maximum effect.

When the Griffin dies, he may drop a Blizzard Ring. This increases your 
Magic by 1, and can allow your character to cast Blizzard at any time, 
as it is actually a piece of Magicite strapped onto a ring. With this 
artifact in hand, go to the wall to the right where the Water Flan was 
in front of and examine it. You will find a door. Go inside. It is another 
Moogle House. You can have the Moogle inside to stamp your card. Then you 
can leave.

Now, the entire Veo Lu Sluice has been explored. Go back to the gate and 
go through it. You can fight the boss now. The camera focuses on the myrrh 
tree, surrounded by a tiny moat, separated from a large circular area by 
a sturdy wooden gate. Your character enters the area. There is some weird 
lower body of some bizarre machine standing in front of a waterfall. That 
machine spots you coming, and the sphere in the center of its body glow 
with a green light. It turns around, it focuses on your Mog holding the 
crystal chalice. An alarm sounds, probably the machine is crying "Intruder 
alert!" Oh well, and it is a red alert too! The sphere turns red in colour. 
Now, bits of blocks on the ground swirl around, and stick onto the machine, 
forming a giant robot. It's Golem! Let's fight!

---------------
Boss Battle
---------------
Boss: Golem
HP: 400
Attacks:
Giant Punch
Rapid Long Arm Spin
Dual Fist Missile Launch
Red Fire Beam (Burns)
Blue Ice Beam (Freezes)
Slowness Gas
Minions: 
Single Player: 2 Water Flans
Two Player: 4 Water Flans
Recommended Equipment: Accurate Watch
Useful Item: Green Sphere (Player 1 ~144 points, Player 2 ~92 points)
You are now up against the robot guardian of the myrrh tree of Veo Lu. 
Apparently he has been placed here by the Yukes to guard the sluice from 
monsters but he is now programmed to attack any intruders here. The Golem 
is assisted by 2 minions, 2 Water Flans, to be precise. The 2 Water Flans 
are not a big deal. However, if you are playing in a 2-player game, then 
4 Water Flans will be present to help their master!

Fortunately, Water Flans are very easy to deal with. They tend to group 
together and can only deal very little damage. As they are so weak against 
fire, wait for all of them to bunch up at once. Then cast a couple of Fira 
Spells and they will all melt down. Then, you can focus on the Golem.

The Golem is a robot, and many robots have many features. First, at close 
range, the Golem will just bash your character twice with its two gigantic 
fists. This is rather difficult to avoid, as it comes out without warning, 
and that is the most unpredictable close range attack in the game. TO avoid 
it well, the safe way would be to maintain your distance, and use focus 
attacks or spells.

A close range, Golem can also stick his arms out really long, and will 
start to spin around like a spinning top. This is another really devastating 
move. If your character is right next to the body of the Golem, they can 
take up to two hits before they can break free. Fortunately, you can tell 
he is about to use it when he sticks his arms out. Thanks to a rather long 
delay. You should be able to run just far enough to get only one hit, or 
if you are super fast, none at all.

As the Golem is just so deadly at close range, my advice is to use ranged 
focus attacks and spells if your defense is below 50.

Of course, Golem also shines when long range combat is concerned. After 
all he is a robot. The first attack is the dual fist missile launch, where 
the Golem will act like someone in those Japanese robot cartoons, and will 
launch both of their fists at you! You can tell when Golem lowers his arms 
so that they are parallel to the ground. They are just so easy to avoid, 
and you can usually get between the two hands. After the two fists have 
been launched, it will take a few seconds for Golem to gain new hands, 
and you can run in and bash him freely in that duration of time.

The Golem also has his own series of death rays. There are two types, a 
red type, where he will zap the area around him, and then letting out a 
big explosion. It does not matter whether you touch the beam, or get hit 
by the explosion, the end result is a burn. Therefore, run when you see 
him spinning the beam round.

The other death ray is blue in colour, and the Golem will fire two of them 
in a criss cross pattern directly in front of him. This is easier to avoid. 
Just don't get hit by the beam and you will not be frozen. In both cases, 
the Golem will squat down onto the ground, and hence you will know when 
to run away.

The final attack is another status changing one. The Golem, much like 
Armstrong, will let out blue gas that slows you down. This is just 
unpredictable. But if you are slowed down. Stay calm, don't panic, and 
continue with the bashing.

Eventually, the Golem's HP will be completely depleted, and you will see 
the sphere on Golem's chest flashing between red, yellow and green. Finally, 
the sphere decides to stay in a yellow colour. The expression on the sphere 
turns into a sad look. The Golem then collapses and falls into a lot of 
tiny pieces. The camera will then focus on the central part of Golem's 
body. Now, the sphere is having a neutral expression, and it turns off.

You get to see your character gathering myrrh from the tree surrounded 
by the moat, and then Mail Moogle will come. 

*****TWO PLAYER STRATEGY*****
As I said above, if you are playing with 2 players, you will have to face 
4 Water Flans in addition to the Golem, so it will be a 2 vs 5 battle. 
You must act quickly. If you don't do things fast enough, the Water Flans 
may reappear even before you have a chance to concentrate on Golem! So, 
you know what to do! Let them have a taste of Fira! Water Flans are vulnerable 
to Fira, so once they are alight, slash these stale puddings to pieces, 
and serve with caramel sauce as topping.

Now, that is taken care of, go for Golem now! Golem is much smarter than 
the other bosses. His attacks are omnidirectional, so they work in 360 
degrees around him. All those lasers, gases and his spinning attacks make 
up the majority of his attacks, so there really is no avoiding all of them, 
no matter how hard you try. The best course of action is to cast spells 
at him from a range using Focus Attacks and Spells. If your stats are high 
enough, feel free to challenge Golem in a melee combat. Good luck. It may 
prove a struggle to beat here in a 2 player game, so Cure very frequently, 
and eventually you can shop this oversized robot into little pieces.

Artifact List
---------------
Reply as usual and you will come across the item selection screen. If you 
get a high score, you may get to take the Green Sphere home with you as 
a souvenir. The Green Sphere can be used to craft the Thief's Emblem, an 
accessory for Selkies. I am not sure of the score requirement for single 
player game, but last time, I played a 2 player game, Player 1 got 144, 
Player 2 got 92, and the Green Sphere is there for grabs. So, that's the 
score your character would have to obtain.

Set 1 (Ice Brand, Silver Bracer, Bucler, Blizzard Ring*):
This has got to be the first and easiest set to be found in Veo Lu Sluice, 
and the Blizzard Ring really is a treat! Just do as badly as possible and 
you can cast Blizzard at any time.

Set 2 (Green Beret, Sage's Staff, Silver Spectacles, Moon Pendant*):
This set is again found exclusively in Cycle 1 of Veo Lu Sluice. To get 
the set, score about 90 points in a single player game, 100 points in a 
2 player game, 110 points in a 3 player game and 120 points in a 4 player 
game. 

Set 3 (Fang Charm, Cat's Bell, Elven Mantle, Moon Pendant*):
This is the first of 2 sets that are found in both Cycle 1 and Cycle 2. 
To get this set in Cycle 1, get around 120 in a single player or 2 player 
game, 140 points in 3 player game and 150 points in a 4 player game. To 
get it in Cycle 2, just do your worst, get around 0 points and the set 
is your party's for the taking.

Set 4 (Shuriken, Faerie Ring, Sparkling Bracer, Blizzard Ring*):
This is the second of 2 sets that are found in both Cycles 1 and 2 in the 
Veo Lu Sluice. To get this set in Cycle 1, score around 140 points in a 
single player game, 160 points in a 2 player game, 180 points in a 3 player 
game and 190 points in a 4 player game. To get it in Cycle 2, score about

in a 3 player game and 120 points in a 4 player game.

Set 5 (Heavy Armband, Wonder Bangle, Rat's Tail, Moon Pendant*):
This is the first of the 2 sets that are found in both Cycles 2 and 3. 
To get it in Cycle 2, get around 120 in a single player or 2 player game, 
140 points in 3 player game and 150 points in a 4 player game. To get it 
in Cycle 3, just do your worst in that cycle.

Set 6 (Loaded Dice, Noah's Lute*, Blizzard Ring):
This is the second of the 2 sets that are found in both Cycles 2 and 3. 
To get this set in Cycle 2, score around 140 points in a single player 
game, 160 points in a 2 player game, 180 points in a 3 player game and 
190 points in a 4 player game. To get it in Cycle 3, score about 90 points 
in a single player game, 100 points in a 2 player game, 110 points in a 
3 player game and 120 points in a 4 player game.

Set 7 (Green Beret*, Winged Cap): 
This is the first of two sets that are only found in Cycle 3. This set 
also includes the design for a Diamond Helm, as well as the Green Sphere 
as the 3rd and 4th options. To get this set, get around 120 in a single 
player or 2 player game, 140 points in 3 player game and 150 points in 
a 4 player game.

Set 8 (Fang Charm, Candy Ring, Taotie Motif*):
This has got to be the "Power Set" of Veo Lu Sluice. The Taotie Motif can 
increase your character's Magic by 7! This really is powerful! To get this 
set, score around 140 points in a single player game, 160 points in a 2 
player game, 180 points in a 3 player game and 190 points in a 4 player 
game. Then, the Taotie Motif will up for grabs for the winner!

Now, with the Shella Mark in hand, you can enter the village of Shella.

---------------------
ii. Shella [FFCC4E2]
---------------------
Type of Area: Town
Number of Merchants: 2
Number of Tailors: 1

Crystal Caravan: Amidatty and 3 others
Shella's Crystal Caravan is comprised of 4 members, all of them Yukes. 
This has got to be the most intellectual and geeky caravan in the game. 
Most of the time when you meet them in the game, they will ask you if you 
would like to listen to some old Yukish wisdom for a sum of 10 gil. Say 
yes, and Amidatty will say "If you ever encounter a [enemy name], do this..." 
He will tell you what you should do when you meet a monster, and will be 
noted down in your diary. At the same time, Amidatty may ask you to come 
over and look at his loaf of molded Bannock. He is trying to use the Bannock 
to explain the world, and the mold represents the miasma. Such an 
intellectual approach to problems is probably why he is most talked about 
in the Shella residents.

Now, Shella is some sort of an island village perched on the northeastern 
edge of Lake Shella. You will find that there is originally no bridge to 
cross. To cross, talk to the adult Yuke, not the young one, if you do carry 
the Shella Mark, then he will cross. Whenever you cross, you will have 
to spend one Shella Mark. Therefore you will have to buy one from a merchant 
after you cross. There are two merchants that sell different things. Here's 
what they sell.

*****ELIJAH THE MERCHANT*****
Strange Liquid	20 gil
Shella Mark	50 gil

*****MAMLART THE MERCHART*****
Flame Craft	100 gil
Frost Craft	100 gil
Lightning Craft	100 gil
Clockwork	100 gil
New Clockwork	100 gil
Blue Yarn	100 gil
White Yarn	100 gil
Gold Craft	100 gil
Shella Mark	50 gil

All of the designs can be made into accessories that help resist status 
ailments. Now, go forward past the two merchants. There is a tree stump 
which is hollow and has a ladder on it to the left of the path. Exaine 
it to find a moogle house. Climb down and he can stamp your card. Then, 
cross the bridge to the main island.

The Main Island has a large crystal surrounding it. You can find different 
bridges along the circular path leading to different islands. Let me cover 
all of them in a clockwise direction. The first bridge leads to and island 
where 2 Clavats and 2 Lilties listen to a Yuke lecturer about the 4 elements. 
Listen to him as well. It contains important information. This is what 
Ruckleir will say:

Side Quest! De Nam's Progress
There will be a Selkie somewhere around here. Talk to him, and he will 
tell you something about the Miasma, and will tell you that he will set 
off to Conall Curach and investigate. The character that talked to him 
will receive letters from him. After some time, the letters will stop coming. 
Then go to Conall Curach, and kill monsters until one drops a Worn Bandanna. 
It belongs to De Nam. I guess he met a rather nasty end, being killed and 
eaten by one of the monsters. Ugh...

"The world is governed by 4 elements: Fire, Water, Earth and Wind. Legends 
speak of an unknown higher element that triumphs over the other 4. Research 
on this unknown element is under way. We hope to find records that can 
shed light on this element's nature. We discovered an ancient Selkic text 
the other day, but it contained no mention of it at all."

Hear that? There is an unknown element out somewhere in this world. Later 
you will get to find it. Now, get back to the central island and get onto 
the next one. There are two Yukes saying how they will study magic to the 
left, and to the right, if you examine the corner there, you will find 
a hidden item.

The final island has a tailor named Spiran, who can craft all accessories 
in the game. Now, you can get out knowing all of this.

---------------------------------
iii. Spiran the Tailor [FFCC4E3]
---------------------------------
Spiran is, well, the only tailor that can be found in Final Fantasy: Crystal 
Chronicles. Well, what a small world! He can craft all accessories in the 
game, which is a plus. But the remote nature of Shella makes it hard to 
find him, and that it is good to have a tailor in your village to help 
out.

*****ACCESSORIES FOR ALL*****
Design: Flame Craft
Accessory: Flame Badge
Materials: Iron Shard x2, Magma Rock x1, 300 gil
Effect: Resist Fire +1
By wearing this badge, your character will resist Fire, and will not be 
burnt as easily as before. The Magma Rock is found in the hands of Fire 
Element enemies like Fire Bombs, Fire Mus and so on. Same can be said for 
the design for this badge. Note that wearing a Flame Badge alone is not 
sufficient to protect your character against stronger Fire attacks like 
Fira and Firaga, and hence you should wear this in conjunction with a 
Crystal Chalice with a Fire Element for the maximum effect.

Design: Lightning Craft
Accessory: Thunder Badge
Materials: Iron Shard x2, Thunderball x1, 300 gil
Effect: Resist Lightning +1
By wearing this badge, your character will resist lightning, and will not 
be shocked as easily as before. The Thunderball is found in the hands of 
Electric Element enemies like Electric Bombs, Electric Scorpions and so 
on. Same can be said for the design for this badge. Note that wearing a 
Thunder Badge alone is not sufficient to protect your character against 
stronger Thunder attacks like Thundara and Thundaga, and hence you should 
wear this in conjunction with a Crystal Chalice with a Wind Element for 
the maximum effect.

Design: Frost Craft
Accessory: Frost Badge
Materials: Iron Shard x2, Chilly Gel x1, 300 gil
Effect: Resist Cold +1
By wearing this badge, your character will resist Cold, and will not be 
frozen in as easily as before. The Chilly Gel is found in the hands of 
Ice Element enemies like Ice Bombs, Snow Mus and so on. Same can be said 
for the design for this badge. Note that wearing a Frost Badge alone is 
not sufficient to protect your character against stronger Blizzaard 
attacks like Blizzara and Blizzaga, and hence you should wear this in 
conjunction with a Crystal Chalice with a Water Element for the maximum 
effect.

Design: Blue Yarn
Accessory: Blue Misanga
Materials: Needle x1, Blue Silk x1, 300 gil
Effect: Resist Poison +1
By wearing this misanga, I guess it's some kind of cloak, or cape or 
something like that, your character will gain some protection from all 
the poisons that they encounter in this game. Must be some kind of lab 
gown for Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles. The wearer will gain one point 
of resistance to poison, and hence will not be poisoned as often. The Needle 
is found on a Cactuar in Lynari Desert, while the Blue Silk can be bought 
from a merchant in Leuda, or found on a Ghost. Note that there exist some 
poisonous attacks that are much stronger, and to protect against those, 
have your Crystal Chalice bear the Earth Element at the same time.

Design: White Yarn
Accessory: White Misanga
Materials: Needle x1, White Silk x1, 300 gil
Effect: Resist Poison +1
By wearing this misanga, I guess it's some kind of cloak, or cape or 
something like that, your character will gain some protection from all 
the curses that they encounter in this game. Must be some kind of priest 
gown for Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles. The wearer will gain one point 
of resistance to curse, and hence will never be cursed. The Needle is found 
on a Cactuar in Lynari Desert, while the White Silk can found on a Ghost. 
I am not sure whether it can be bought from a merchant or not at the time 
being.

Design: Clockwork
Accessory: Accurate Watch
Materials: Bronze Shard x3, Worm Antenna x1, Gear x1, 300 gil
Effect: Resist Slow +1
Well, I guess this is one of the two ways for the people in the world of 
Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles. Therefore, they must be in the year 
1500 or after, as watches were invented during the Renaissance. The 
accurate watch is so accurate, maybe more accurate than the Caesium powered 
Atomic Clock, so accurate that it can maintain the steady flow of time. 
Therefore, time won't be slowed, and your character will become resistant 
to slowness. However, there is a stronger spell called Slowga, that cannot 
be protected simply by wearing this watch. You would have to equip Time 
Armor at the same time. Understand?

Design: New Clockwork
Accessory: Unfaltering Watch
Materials: Bronze Shard x3, Toad Oil x1, Gear x1
Effect: Resist Stasis +1
Well, I guess this is the second of the two ways for the people in the 
world of Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles to keep time. Therefore, they 
must be in the year 1500 or after, as watches were invented during the 
Renaissance. The unfaltering watch is so accurate, and is also unfaltering. 
Maybe more accurate than the Caesium powered Atomic Clock, so accurate 
and reliable that it can maintain the steady flow of time. Therefore, time 
won't be stopped, and your character will become resistant to stasis. My 
bet is that the Toad Oil here is used as a lubricant for the Gear to prevent 
wearing down of parts. No wonder that this watch will never falters.

Design: Gold Craft
Accessory: Gold Necklace
Materials: Gold x2, Cockatrice Scale x1, 300 gil
Effect: Resist Stone +1
This is another beautifully crafted accessory made from pure gold. Well, 
it can really attract the ladies. Only joking. Anyway, the Gold Craft will 
enable your character to Resist Stone, so they will not be stoned as often. 
Oops, I mean, they will not be turned into stone as often as before. It 
seems that anything that is made of gold in this game can help prevent 
petrifaction of your character. I bet the Cockatrice Scale is used as the 
jewel component of the necklace. Note that there exist stronger attacks 
that can turn your character into stone even if they are wearing the 
necklace. You can stop that by using the Earth Element as well.

Design: Ring of Light
Accessory: Crystal Ring
Materials: Silver x1, Tiny Crystal, 1000 gil
Effect: Resist Miasma +30
A Crystal Ring, well this is one of the many accessories women will swoon 
over in the real world. However, in Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles, 
wearing this ring has an additional effect on the character than attracting 
men to come over. As the ring has the essence of the crystal in it, your 
character will be partially protecting against miasma, and will take damage 
much slower than before when they leave the Crystal's Aura. Well, I guess 
we all know how this ring is made. The Silver is used to make the metallic 
portion of the ring, while the Tiny Crystal is the jewel. But still, who 
would be bothered to run out to the miasma?

Design: Ring of Invincibility
Accessory: Force Ring
Materials: Orichalcum x1, Dark Sphere x1, 50000 gil
Effect: Resist Attack +1
This ring has been dubbed by many as the best accessory in the game. Probably 
because it required very expensive materials and such a high price. Dark 
Spheres are to be bought from the merchant of your village for 50000 gil 
if there are no discounts. It is also crafted at your village tailor for 
a sum of 50000 gil! To get the design, you must have an Alchemist as your 
father, and he will give it to you after 14 years of sending materials 
home. This rings allows your character to resist attack, but what it really 
means is that your character can never be knocked back when attack. 
Therefore, I do not find this accessory to be worth it at all. I find another 
one more valuable, and it is much more easily accessible.

*****ACCESSORIES FOR WOMEN*****
Design: Lady's Accessories
Accessory: Flower Bracer
Materials: Silver x2, Ruby x1, Pressed Flower x1, 400 gil
Effect: Casting Time -5
It is very easy to tell that this accessory is for women. When you pick 
it up from Maggie's Room in the Moschet Manor, you pick the design up and 
it is called Lady's Accessories. Well, it is made of Silver, a Ruby and 
a pressed flower, I guess it is because women like flowers, as they are 
poetic. The pressed flower can be found anywhere, but has a 50% chance 
of appearing on the Sahagin Lord of Conall Curach. When equipped, the female 
character's spell charging times will be slightly decreased. Then you can 
cast spells faster. Is it really that useful? Well, I don't think so, not 
a larger enough decrement.

Design: Fashion Kit
Accessory: Jade Bracer
Materials: Silver x2, Jade x1, Pressed Flower, 2500 gil
Effect: Regen
This is just as easy for me to tell that it is an accessory for women. 
This is also picked up from Maggie's room in Moschet Manor. It is called 
a fashion kit. Now, I don't want to stereotype all the women out there, 
but it seems that women like to buy more clothes than men! (My mom still 
buys clothes for me! I have no fashion sense.) It seems the latest fashion 
in the world of Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles is to wear bracers that 
give Regen status to the wearer. But what is a Regen status, well, to put 
it simply is that your female character will recover health much more 
quickly than normal. Therefore, this has got to be the best accessory for 
women out there, in my opinion. Try it, you can be guaranteed that you 
won't be using Cure even once! Good for "Don't heal yourself" bonus.

*****ACCESSORIES FOR MEN*****
Design: Zeal Kit
Accessory: Zeal Headband
Materials: Blue Silk x1, Tiny Crystal x1, Remedy x1, 400 gil
Effect: Focus Attack Charge Time -5
Well, this is just the kind of accessory for men, a headband. I always 
thought the noun form of zealous was zealousy, but I was proven wrong two 
years ago when I learned of the word zeal. Anyway, any men wearing this 
headband would become more zealous than before, but not as zealous as those 
Japanese Kamikaze pilots! But still, they will be affected in a way that 
their focus attack charge time will be slightly decreased. This is just 
as cool as the flower bracer. At the same time, the Remedy can also be 
found on the Sahagin Lord in Conall Curach. But if your father is an 
alchemist, he may mail you this item, so always read the mail. However, 
one thing for certain is that -5 is not a big enough decrement. It is hardly 
noticeable. Therefore, equip better accessories, I tell you.

Design: Healing Kit
Accessory: Healing Headband
Materials: White Silk x1, Tiny Crystal x1, Remedy x1, 2500 gil
Effect: Regen
This is yet another headband for all those zealous male characters or I 
should say, warriors out there. The Healing Headband is just another of 
those accessories suitable for those sporty types out there, including 
one of my main characters in the party. Well, the Healing Headband, like 
the Jade Bracer, gives Regen status to the wearer, meaning that he will 
gain health over time much more quickly than before. In my opinion, this 
is obviously the best accessory that a male character can get his hands 
on, and it is also 20 times cheaper to craft than that annoying little 
Force Ring! See? You want the best? Here it is.

*****ACCESSORIES FOR CLAVATS*****
Design: Daemon Kit
Accessory: Devil's Earring
Materials: Silver x1, Devil's Claw x1, 1200 gil
Effect: Status Change Effects +60
Yes, they actually got the nerve to name the design after the notorious 
Mailer-Daemon, the address that deals with rejected e-mails on ISPs. The 
Daemon Kit is used to design the Devil's Earring, an accessory for Clavats. 
Yes, Silver is very easy to find, but the Devil's Claw is another story. 
To get a Devil's Claw, you will have to go all the way to Rebena Te Ra 
and defeat a Nightmare. Then, he may drop a Devil's Claw to you after it 
dies. As for the effect it has on your player, it raises the status change 
effects on your character by 60, which means that whenever you cast a spell 
on an enemy that induces a Status Ailment, it will be affected for longer. 
This is good especially on Fire, then they can be burnt for a long time, 
allowing for more extra powered hits.

Design: Secrets of Wisdom
Accessory: Wisdom Talisman
Materials: Needle x1, Chimera's Horn x1, 1200 gil
Effect: Casting Time -15
I always thought that the Yukes are the wisest race of the 4 tribes. However, 
I guess I am proved wrong with this accessory. Well, this accessory promotes 
wisdom on your little Clavat, and will allow him/her to cast spells quicker. 
To be more precise, Clavats can cast most spells as fast as the Yukes do 
with this accessory. I guess the Clavats are really benefiting from the 
Casting Time -15 effect. However, finding the materials for the accessory 
is another story. To be able to craft the Wisdom Talisman, you must go 
all the way to Lynari Desert. There will be Cactuars to provide the Needle, 
while there are some very tough Chimeras to supply the Chimera's Horn for 
you to enjoy. Enjoy! Just don't get killed!

Design: Twisted Scope
Accessory: Designer Glasses
Materials: Gold x1, Crystal Ball x2, Chimera's Horn x1, 1200 gil
Effect: Spell Range +20
Now, since when are all the Clavats short sighted? Why would they ever 
need to wear glasses? Well, I guess these glasses are not to deal with 
eye defects, but are there to help enhance your vision. For one thing, 
your Clavat will be able to see further away, and hence they can be casting 
spells at a longer range than before. The Gold is used to make the frame, 
the Crystal Balls are to make the lenses, while the Chimera's Horn is 
probably a decoration. Crystal Balls can be bought from a merchant in Leuda, 
while the Chimera's Horn can be obtained from a Chimera. It is entirely 
up to decide whether it is worth it to craft such glasses.

*****ACCESSORIES FOR LILTIES*****
Design: Faerie Kit
Accessories: Pixie's Earring
Materials: Silver x1, Faerie's Tear x1, 400 gil
Effect: Resist Status Changes +30
With the Pixie's Earring, your Lilty will resist status changes by 30. 
This means that, whenever a Lilty suffers from a status ailment like burns, 
curse, poison and others, he/she will lose the ailment much quicker than 
before. Is that clear? This is particularly helpful when you are in a 
situation that you are affected by a status ailment, and that there are 
so many enemies surrounding you that you cannot cast Clear on yourself, 
then this earring may save your life. The Faerie's Tear can be found on 
an Ahriman, while the Silver can just be bought from a merchant.

Design: Goggle Techniques
Accessories: Power Goggles
Materials: Bronze x1, Crystal Ball x1, 400 gil
Effect: Focus Attack Range +20
Well, the Lilties are not ready to swim or fly fighter planes, but this 
accessory can really help them. With the Goggles on their eyes, the Lilties 
will be able to see further away from them. Therefore, as they love to 
use physical attacks so much, they have the ability to have a longer Focus 
Attack Range. Very nice for those people who would like to perform Sneak 
Attacks with Lilties. But for some strange reason, you are required to 
use an alloy to make the goggles. You will need one chunk of bronze, as 
well as a single Crystal Ball this time. My guess is that the Crystal Ball 
will be cut in half and each half will be used to fit the lenses of the 
goggles. As simple as that.

Design: Lion Soul
Accessory: Lion's Heart
Materials: Ruby x1, Cerberus Fang x1, 800 gil
Effect: Focus Attack +1
The Lilties were once brave warriors, but now, since the Iron in the Mine 
of Carthiges is exhausted, they no longer have as much ambition as before. 
Well, this accessory can help them become braver than before. With the 
Lion's Heart Equipped, the Lilty can become as courageous as the lions. 
Therefore, their focus attack power can be slightly increased. This 
accessory is not too difficult to craft, as the Ruby can be bought from 
a merchant in Leuda, while the Cerberus Fang can be found on a well, Cerberus. 
I find this accessory to be more worth it than the one below. You will 
see why when I introduce it to you.

Design: Dragon Soul
Accessory: Dragon's Heart
Materials: Dragon's Fang x1, Ruby x2, Orc Belt x1, 2000 gil
Effect: Focus Attack +3
With this accessory in their hand, or maybe heart, the Lilty will become 
even braver than the lion, and will become as brave as a dragon. Therefore, 
their focus attack power is increased by 3 points, instead of just one. 
However, this is only the bright side of things. The dark side is that 
it is just very difficult to craft. I know, the Rubies are very common, 
but for the Dragon's Fang, your Lilty must beat the Dragon Zombie in Conall 
Curach with a super high score, and hope that it will appear in the item 
selection screen. The same thing goes for the Orc Belt, as you will have 
to fight the Orc King in the Mine of Carthuiges and hope that it appears. 
If you would waste your time to get this accessory, I would wish you the 
best of luck, my gaming pal.

*****ACCESSORIES FOR YUKES*****
Design: Wisdom Tome
Accessory: Wisdom Charm
Materials: Needle x1, Coeurl's Whisker x1, 400 gil
Effect: Casting Time -10
That's more like it. The Yukes also have an accessory that deals with their 
wisdom. With this in hand, a Yuke can cast spells even faster than before. 
The design for this accessory is very common, and can be found quite often 
in Goblin Wall. However, the materials are a different story. In order 
to get the Needle, you must again, take a ship to Leuda and enter Lynari 
Desert. Then, find a Cactuar, defeat him and get the loot. You may hope 
to be sold one of these by the caravan of the Fields of Fum or the caravan 
of Leuda. As for the Coeurl's Whisker, it's found on, a well, a Coeurl.

Design: Fiend Kit
Accessory: Daemon's Earring
Materials: Silver x1, Fiend's Claw x1, 400 gil
Effect: Status Change Effects +30
Yes, they actually got the nerve to name the accessory after the notorious 
Mailer-Daemon, the address that deals with rejected e-mails on ISPs. The 
Fiend Kit is used to design the Daemon's Earring, an accessory for Yukes. 
Yes, Silver is very easy to find, but the Fiend's Claw is another story, 
you will again, will have to take a long boat trip to Leuda, and buy it 
from the female merchant there. How annoying. As for the effect it has 
on your player, it raises the status change effects on your character by 
60, which means that whenever you cast a spell on an enemy that induces 
a Status Ailment, it will be affected for longer. This is good especially 
on Fire, then they can be burnt for a long time, allowing for more extra 
powered hits.

Design: Eyewear Techniques
Accessory: Twisted Spectacles
Materials: Silver x1, Crystal Ball x2, 400 gil
Effect: Spell Range +20
Now, since when are all the Yukes short sighted as well? Why would they 
ever need to wear spectacles? Besides, how can the spectacles fit on the 
Yuke with his/her helm on? Well, I guess these spectacles are not to deal 
with eye defects, but are there to help enhance your vision. For one thing, 
your Yuke will be able to see further away, and hence they can be casting 
spells at a longer range than before. The Silver is used to make the frame, 
the Crystal Balls are to make the lenses. Crystal Balls can be bought from 
a merchant in Leuda. It is entirely up to decide whether it is worth it 
to craft such glasses.

Design: Magic Tome
Accessory: Wizard's Soul
Materials: Jade x1, Coeurl's Whisker x1, 800 gil
Effect: Spell Damage +1
This accessory sounds a bit disgusting indeed. After all, how can a Yuke 
wear the soul of a wizard? Better perform an exorcism. However, having 
the soul of a wizard inside your already magic enabled Yuke does work 
wonders. For one thing, their spell damage can be slightly increased, by 
one unit, to be precise. This is only good for those people who like to 
use spells in combat, but not good for those brawlers, but since Yukes 
are all magicians anyway, what the heck! The Jade can be bought from the 
merchant in Leuda, while the Coeurl's Whisker can be found on a Coeurl, 
it seems that the Coeurl's Whisker is used to craft a lot of magic related 
accessories recently. I wonder...

Design: Sorcery Tome
Accessory: Bishop's Soul
Materials: Jade x2, Cursed Crook x1, 2000 gil
Effect: Magic Power +3
This accessory sounds just as disgusting as the accessory mentioned above. 
After all, having the soul of a wizard is one thing, but having the soul 
of a Bishop is another thing. Yes, this accessory is so holy that your 
magic enabled Yuke can work more wonders than before. Their Magic Power 
can be increased by an increment of 3. Again, it is only good for those 
people who like to use spells in combat, but not good for those brawlers, 
but since Yukes are all magicians anyway, what the heck! The materials 
are another story. To get the Cursed Crook, you must beat the Gblin King 
in Goblin Wall with a high score as mentioned above in the walkthroughs. 
Now, finding rare materials for accessories is just impractical. Therefore, 
I do not recommend you crafting this unless you just happen to run upon 
the Cursed Crook.

Design: Forbidden Tome
Accessory: Elemental's Soul 
Materials: Dweomer Spore x1, Etheral Orb x1, Malboro Seed x1, 5000 gil
Effect: Spell Damage +5
Oh, you have touched the Forbidden Tome, you will never see the light, 
of day! No, this is not the Disney movie Aladdin, but this accessory has 
a good reason to have a design that is called Forbidden Tome. For one thing, 
this elemental's soul can cause your magically enabled Yuke to become super 
powerful when the usage of magic is concerned. After all, there is a great 
increment of 5 when Spell Damage is concerned, now your Yukes can cause 
great damage when casting spells. But is it worth it, I don't think so. 
The big downside of this accessory is that it is expensive, and in order 
to craft it, you must find 3 different spoils from 3 different bosses in 
the game. The Dweomer Spore from Armstrong, the Etheral Orb from the Lich 
and the Malboro Seed from the Malboro! Even if you get high scores in those 
level, you still may not be able to choose them! The horror of it all! 
But if you DO happen to run upon one, well, choose it, you may not be able 
to choose them for a long time!

*****ACCESSORIES FOR SELKIES*****
Design: Speed Tome
Accessory: Speed Charm
Materials: Needle x1, Giga's Claw x1, 400 gil
Effect: Focus Attack Charge Time -5
Selkies are the masters of speed. They have specially designed accessories 
to boost their speed even more. Their Focus Attack charges the fastest 
among the 4 tribes already. But now, there is yet another upgrade that 
allows them to charge it up even faster. It is the Speed Charm. The Speed 
Charm requires a Needle and a Gigas Claw. To get the Needle, once again, 
you will have to send your character all the far to the faraway land of 
Lynari Desert, find a Cactuar and kill him for the Needle. As for the Gigas 
Claw, you can enter Selepation Cave and kill a Gigas for his claw. This 
is a cheap accessory, and it's worth your time to craft it.

Design: Angel Kit
Accessory: Angel's Earring
Materials: Silver x1, Angel's Tear x1, 1200 gil
Effect: Resist Status Changes +60
This is another accessory that is easy to craft for the Selkies. This time, 
you can wear the earring that used to belong to an angel. Only joking! 
This means that, whenever a Selkie suffers from a status ailment like burns, 
curse, poison and others, he/she will lose the ailment much quicker than 
before. Is that clear? This is particularly helpful when you are in a 
situation that you are affected by a status ailment, and that there are 
so many enemies surrounding you that you cannot cast Clear on yourself, 
then this earring may save your life. Yes, you may think that the Angel's 
Tear can only found in the heavens, but hey no! All you need to do is to 
kill an Ahriman and he will drop one!

Design: Designer Goggles
Accessory: Eagle Goggles
Materials: Iron x1, Crystal Ball x1, Griffin's Wing x1, 1200 gil
Effect: Focus Attack Range +20
It seems that all tribes have their own eyewear, even though they are not 
all born to be shortsighted. Anyway, these Eagle Goggles are not an 
exception, they improve your Selkies' sight. Therefore, you can see further 
away, and can have a longer focus attack range, which is good for all those 
Selkie snipers out there. These goggles have an Iron frame, and they will 
split a Crystal Ball in half to make the lens. Then, as it is a pair of 
Eagle Goggles, some bird references, provided by the Griffin's Wing are 
needed. Let's just hope these iron goggles won't rust in the rain...

Design: Speed Secrets
Accessory: Speed Talisman
Materials: Needle x1, Zu's Beak x1, 1200 gil
Effect: Focus Attack Charge Time -10
Selkies are the masters of speed. They have specially designed accessories 
to boost their speed even more. Their Focus Attack charges the fastest 
among the 4 tribes already. But now, there is yet another upgrade that 
allows them to charge it up even faster than the Speed Charm. It is the 
Speed Talisman. The Speed Talisman requires a Needle and a Zu's Beak. To 
get the Needle, once again, you will have to send your character all the 
far to the faraway land of Lynari Desert, find a Cactuar and kill him for 
the Needle. As for the Zu's Beak, go and hang around the desert, find a 
Zu, kill him, and let's hope that he will drop a Zu's Beak to you. This 
is a cheap accessory, and it's worth your time to craft it.

Design: Brigandology
Accessory: Thief's Emblem
Materials: Wind Crystal x1, Orc Belt x1, Green Sphere x1, 5000 gil
Effect: Focus Attack Charge Time -15
Kids, what are Selkies the best at? (Whole class replies loudly) Thieves! 
That's right! Selkies are the masters of speed. They have specially 
designed accessories to boost their speed even more. This is particularly 
true that many of them used to be thieves. Their Focus Attack charges the 
fastest among the 4 tribes already. But now, there is yet another upgrade 
that allows them to charge it up even faster than the Speed Talisman. It 
is the Thief's Emblem. Now, the Thief's Emblem is also very difficult to 
craft. It requires 3 materials from 3 bosses, the Wind Crystal from the 
Cave Worm, the Orc Belt from the Orc King and the Green Sphere from the 
Golem. IT will be a tremendous waste of time to go after them just for 
the material. You will be better off if you bump into those by chance.

--------------------------
f. Rebena Plains [FFCC4F]
--------------------------
It seems that the developer Square-Enix really has done a good job in making 
references to many registered trademarks around the world. First, there 
was the boss called Malboro, which was one r short of Marlboro, a cigarette 
brand, and then there are the Rebena Plains, which e has substituted a 
in Rabena, the popular blackcurrant syrup drink! Anyway, the Rebena Plains 
is a rather desolate areas of the game. After all, there is not a single 
area with civilization here. There is the swamp called Conall Curach to 
the southwest of your entry point. Then, across the river, which is another 
river that originated from Lake Shella, you will come to a ruined Aztec 
temple thingy called Rebena Te Ra. Then, after you have traveled a long 
distance along the road to the far west, you will come to a Miasma Stream 
with an unknown element! To get that unknown element, you must activate 
the hotspot in Lynari Desert, which will be covered later. This area taunts 
two levels and two road junctions, which is quite simple in structure.

The levels are very tough in the third cycle, therefore I advise you 
character's stats should be over 60 in Strength, Defense and Magic before 
you even think about entering these levels.

--------------------------
i. Conall Curach [FFCC4F1]
--------------------------
Type of Area: Level

You will again be briefed by the woman who sang the opening theme. You 
will be shown an overhead view of this swamp. She will tell you that this 
swamp has thwarted travelers since ancient times. The rain there is thick 
with miasma. On the other hand, the Selkies are at that point, driven from 
their ancestral home, probably due to their poor reputation as thieves 
and such. Therefore, they arrived at this swamps, and thought of it to 
be their new haven. They built bridges across the swamp. However by the 
time they have arrived at the other side, they could find no land to call 
home, many died. (Actually, you can just make this town rather like Venice 
in nature. Stupid Selkies.)

---------------
Enemies
----------------
Snow Mu:
HP: 45
Attacks:
Claw Swipe
Tail Whip
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Slow
Resistance: Cold
These are just some squirrel that would barrow out of the ground to get 
at you. What makes them different from the normal Mus is that they are 
white in colour, more like skunks, and that they bear the Water Element, 
and hence are resistant to Cold attacks like Blizzard. When you see dirt 
rising up from the ground and some cracking sound, you can tell that a 
Mu is coming out to annoy you. These guys are pretty much of an annoyance 
to your character. They will only swipe you with their claws, or sometimes 
will do a loop the loop and hit you with their tail. The Tail Whip in 
particular has a knock back force, and can stun your character. So, be 
careful of that. Otherwise, it won't be that troublesome to get rid of 
them at all, no spells are needed, just physical attacks, but still they 
are slightly tougher than the Mus as Conall Curach is one of the "later 
levels" of Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles.

Fire Bomb:
HP: 30
Attacks:
Airborne Tackle
Fire
Meteor Strike
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Lightning
Resistance: Fire
Useful Items: Magma Rock, Flame Craft, Design for Flame Armor
The Fire Bomb is well, some sort of black sphere like creature with flames 
as hair, and two pairs of evil looking eyes. These enemies are nothing 
but an annoyance, and usually will not pose too much of a threat to you. 
When you are up close to them, they may just swing back and attempt to 
ram into your character. The Fire Bomb knows two different spells. They 
can cast Fire on your character, or even worse, perform a Meteor Strike 
on you! The Meteor Strike is denoted by a pinkish red coloured targeting 
ring with a black circle in the center. When the attack is released, a 
large meteor will drop down from the sky, and onto the targeting ring. 
This move works indoors as well. The meteor strike can do considerable 
damage to your character. Fortunately it has a long delay, and you can 
easily run away from the ring long before the meteor is released upon thee. 
Although the Fire Bomb is vulnerable to cold and lightning, normal physical 
attacks will do. Although the Fire Bomb may be hard to hit while it is 
casting a spell, as it will float rather high up. Once a Fire Bomb is 
destroyed, it will self destruct, burning any enemies or you that appear 
to come too close. You can take advantage of this and destroy a Fire Bomb 
in the middle of a group of enemies and let them all take damage at once. 
Just get out of the proximity before the explosion. Once a Fire Bomb dies, 
it may drop a magma rock, a flame craft or a design for flame armor. Therefore, 
if you are after anti-flame protection devices, you should always go after 
those Fire Bombs.

Ice Bomb:
HP: 37
Attacks:
Airborne Tackle
Blizzard
Meteor Strike
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Lightning
Resistance: Cold
Useful Items: Chilly Gel, Frost Craft, Design for Frost Armor
The Ice Bomb is well, some sort of black sphere like creature with blue 
fumes as hair, and two pairs of evil looking eyes. These enemies are nothing 
but an annoyance, and usually will not pose too much of a threat to you. 
When you are up close to them, they may just swing back and attempt to 
ram into your character. The Ice Bomb knows two different spells. They 
can cast Blizzard on your character, or even worse, perform a Meteor Strike 
on you! The Meteor Strike is denoted by a pinkish red coloured targeting 
ring with a black circle in the center. When the attack is released, a 
large meteor will drop down from the sky, and onto the targeting ring. 
This move works indoors as well. The meteor strike can do considerable 
damage to your character. Fortunately it has a long delay, and you can 
easily run away from the ring long before the meteor is released upon thee. 
Although the Ice Bomb is vulnerable to cold and lightning, normal physical 
attacks will do. The Ice Bomb may be hard to hit while it is casting a 
spell, as it will float rather high up. Once an Ice Bomb is destroyed, 
it will self destruct, freezing any enemies or you that appear to come 
too close. You can take advantage of this and destroy an Ice Bomb in the 
middle of a group of enemies and let them all take damage at once. Just 
get out of the proximity before the explosion. Once an Ice Bomb dies, it 
may drop a blob of Chilly Gel, a frost craft or a design for frost armor. 
Therefore, if you are after anti-cold protection devices, you should always 
go after those Ice Bombs.

Thunder Bomb:
HP: 37
Attacks:
Airborne Tackle
Thunder
Meteor Strike
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Cold
Resistance: Lightning
Useful Items: Thunderball, Lightning Craft, Design for Lightning Armor
The Thunder Bomb is well, some sort of black sphere like creature with 
purple fumes as hair, and two pairs of evil looking eyes with electric 
bolts all over it. These enemies are nothing but an annoyance, and usually 
will not pose too much of a threat to you. When you are up close to them, 
they may just swing back and attempt to ram into your character. The Thunder 
Bomb knows two different spells. They can cast Thunder on your character, 
or even worse, perform a Meteor Strike on you! The Meteor Strike is denoted 
by a pinkish red coloured targeting ring with a black circle in the center. 
When the attack is released, a large meteor will drop down from the sky, 
and onto the targeting ring. This move works indoors as well. The meteor 
strike can do considerable damage to your character. Fortunately it has 
a long delay, and you can easily run away from the ring long before the 
meteor is released upon thee. Although the Thunder Bomb is vulnerable to 
cold and lightning, normal physical attacks will do. The Thunder Bomb may 
be hard to hit while it is casting a spell, as it will float rather high 
up. Once a Thunder Bomb is destroyed, it will self destruct, shocking any 
enemies or you that appear to come too close. You can take advantage of 
this and destroy a Thunder Bomb in the middle of a group of enemies and 
let them all take damage at once. Just get out of the proximity before 
the explosion. Once a Thunder Bomb dies, it may drop a Thunderball, a 
Lighting craft or a design for lightning armor. Therefore, if you are after 
anti-lightning protection devices, you should always go after those 
Thunder Bombs.

Water Flan:
HP: 50
Attacks:
Headbutt
Blue Slowness Gas (Slows you down)
Vulnerability: Fire
Resistance: Cold
No, these are not those tasty pastries that are a lot like quiches. But, 
there are some blob of blue goo that writhes like quicksilver on the ground. 
They are just another of those annoyances you will find in Veo Lu Sluice 
or Conall Curach. They attack by headbutting you with their goop. They 
also may attempt to slow you down by blowing some blue gas out. Otherwise, 
you can just kill them with a couple of hits of your weapon. There is no 
need to use Fire at all, unless you want to waste your time. Of course, 
Water Flans are made of water, unlike the ordinary type. Therefore, they 
are resistant to Cold. When they die, they may drop Chilly Gel, which can 
be used to forge Frost Armor and the Frost Badge.

Flan:
HP: 50
Attacks:
Headbutt
Yellow Slowness Gas (Slows you down)
Vulnerability: Fire
No, these are not those tasty pastries that are a lot like quiches. But, 
there are some blob of yellow goo that writhes like quicksilver on the 
ground. They are just another of those annoyances you will find in Goblin 
Wall. They attack by headbutting you with their goop. They also may attempt 
to slow you down by blowing some yellow gas out. Otherwise, you can just 
kill them with a couple of hits of your weapon. There is no need to use 
Fire at all, unless you want to waste your time. It seems that the Flans 
in Conall Curach have twice the amount of health as their counterparts 
in Goblin Wall. Must have been all the moisture present that encourage 
their growth. With this in mind, you had better be more ready to exploit 
their weaknesses than ever before, or expect a tougher pastry enemy.

Magic Plant:
HP: 45
Attacks:
Energy Ball Spit
Fire
Thunder
Blizzard
Slow
The Magic Plant is a new type of Hell Plant. Hell Plants are bluish green 
in colour with brightly coloured "wings". It's amazing that plants can 
make such cries. Most of the time, they attack from a range, by spitting 
out energy balls at you. They make a very distinguishable sound while doing 
so, therefore, it would not be very hard to anticipate and evade their 
attack. Most of the time, Hell Plants will use this attack. However, the 
meat of this plant are its magic attacks. All magic attacks are given out 
in a very short delay, which means that by the time you see the targeting 
ring beneath your character's feet, it would be too later. Therefore, you 
must be fast on your feet and use hit and run tactics to outwit this super 
fast plant like creature. Yes, you will find a lot of Hell Plants blocking 
the road, making it mandatory to defeat them. Life is tough and cruel, 
isn't it? Don't get hit by spells. There should be a resist all accessory 
against magic. But there are none! You should be more careful in the Conall 
Curach swamp, as they have 50% more health than their counterparts in the 
Mushroom Forest! Hit and run!

Sahagin:
HP: 45
Attacks:
Claw Swipe
Blue Breath Attack
Ice Spike Jab (Freezes)
Blizzard
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Slow, Paralysis
The Sahagin is a blue-green coloured water creature that lives in many 
damp areas like the Selepation Cave and Conall Curach. They like to live 
in water, and when enemies (that's you), come close by, they will just 
out of the water to ambush them. This action is not hard to detect. You 
can hear the splash as the Sahagin jumps out of the water. The Sahagin 
is a decent fighter both in close range and long range. At close quarters, 
a Sahagin can just swipe you with its claws. When you are at medium range, 
a Sahagin will blow some blue breath to you that causes moderate damage. 
He can also stick out an ice spike from one of its claws and jab you with 
it. This attack has the ability to freeze any unsuspecting character in. 
Finally, a Sahagin can also cast Blizzard on you. A Sahagin has quite a 
high defense, and is resistant to many physical attacks. However, it is 
vulnerable towards Fire, and that's all you need to weaken them before 
moving in and brawl with them.

Gigan Toad:
HP: 80
Attacks:
Tongue Jab
Blizzard
Blizzara
Vulnerability: Fire
Resistance: Cold
Useful Item: Toad Oil
Gigan Toads are well, giant blue-green amphibians that like to dwell in 
damp environments like Veo Lu Sluice and Conall Curach. They have a blue 
green back with a clear belly. As a water creature, Gigan Toads love to 
use Ice attacks against you. Therefore, a Gigan Toad as the ability to 
use two different kinds of Blizzard Spell. They are Blizzard and Blizzara. 
Both moves share the same targeting ring, with Blizzara having a wider 
radius than Blizzard. It is always better to be safe than sorry, and run 
considerably away from the ring to avoid the area effects. Of course, Gigan 
Toads are not only capable of long range combat. They are also quite good 
at close quarters. If your character is beating them badly up close, they 
will stick out their tongues to jab you. This does considerable damage 
and is capable of knocking your character back. This is detected by the 
toad leaning back and opening its mouth. Then you can take evasive action. 
Gigan Toads are tougher in Conall Curach. There, you must exploit their 
weakness with fire spells. When a Gigan Toad dies, he may drop a vial of 
Toad Oil, which can be used to craft Eternal Armor and Unfaltering Watches, 
accessories and armor that protects your character from ever being put 
on stasis. As the Conall Curach is a later level, Gigan Toads het 20 more 
HP than those in Veo Lu Sluice. They are more resistant to physical attacks 
too. This makes exploiting their weaknesses here a high priority.

Sahagin Lord:
HP: 75
Attacks:
Claw Swipe
Blue Breath Attack
Ice Spike Jab (Freezes)
Blizzara
Vulnerabilities: Slow, Paralysis
Useful Item: Pressed Flower, Remedy
The Sahagin Lord is well, the Lord of all the Sahagins. There is only one 
in Conall Curach. Unlike the other Sahagins, the Sahagin Lord will not 
jump out of the ground. They will just stand there and wait for others 
approaching him. The Sahagin Lord is a decent fighter both in close range 
and long range. At close quarters, the Sahagin Lord can just swipe you 
with its claws. When you are at medium range, the Sahagin Lord ill blow 
some blue breath to you that causes moderate damage. He can also stick 
out an ice spike from one of its claws and jab you with it. This attack 
has the ability to freeze any unsuspecting character in. Finally, the 
Sahagin Lord can also cast Blizzara on you, he's the Lord of the Sahagins, 
after all. The Sahagin Lord has quite a high defense, and is resistant 
to many physical attacks. Unlike his weaker lower level Sahagins, he is 
also resistant to fire, you may consider stopping him before attacking.

Stone Sahagin:
HP: 20
Attacks:
Claw Swipe
Blue Breath Attack
Ice Spike Jab (Freezes)
Blizzard
Vulnerability: Gravity
Resistance: All Attacks
As if the normal Sahagins aren't enough, we now have Sahagins that are 
made of stone. They like to live in the ground, and when enemies (that's 
you), come close by, they will just out of the ground to ambush them. This 
action is not hard to detect. You can hear the sound as the Sahagin jumps 
out of the water. The Stone Sahagin is a decent fighter both in close range 
and long range. At close quarters, a Stone Sahagin can just swipe you with 
its claws. When you are at medium range, a Stone Sahagin will blow some 
blue breath to you that causes moderate damage. He can also stick out an 
ice spike from one of its claws and jab you with it. This attack has the 
ability to freeze any unsuspecting character in. Finally, a Sahagin can 
also cast Blizzard on you. Fortunately a Stone Sahagin only has 20 HP, 
then you can cast Gravity, then slaughter them in 10 hits.

Abbadon:
HP: 80
Attacks:
Airborne Double Claw Slash
Supercharged Energy Blast
Curse
Vulnerabilities: Gravity
Resistance: All attacks when airborne
Useful Item: Jagged Scythe
Abbadons are another tough airborne enemy. They look like some giant green 
bug with a few pairs of red wings. Abbadons, being the giant bug that they 
are, tends to pack a punch with both of their attacks, as they are just 
so large! Firstly, the Abbadon can slash you with its gigantic scythes. 
This causes lots of damage, and can be super destructive. Secondly, the 
Abbadon can charge up a large blast of energy and launch it towards the 
ground. This is just as devastating than the former attack. However, the 
latter attack is easier to avoid than the former. Whenever you hear the 
Abbadon's charging sound, you should just run out of the way. The best 
approach will be to cast Gravity to bring him down, right? Unfortunately, 
this is not always a good idea for an Abbadon can also cast a Curse on 
your character, and while he/she is cured, the first two attacks can kill 
him/her in only one hit! I wish you the best of luck in defeating these 
monsters. However, with victory comes the spoils. The Abbadons may 
sometimes drop their Jagger Scythe for your use. It can be used to forge 
the Mighty Weapon.

Behemoth:
HP: 180
Atttacks:
Giant Kick
Taser Horn (Shocks)
Fire Tail Whip (Burns)
Ice Tail Whip (Freezes)
Vulnerabilities: Most Magic Attacks
Useful Items: Orichalcum, Diamond Ore
You know what a behemoth is, don't you. There are really gigantic monsters 
that reside in Conall Curach only. They are big purple like creasures that 
walk on four legs. They have these two black horns on their heads that 
can give out electric charges, much like those tasers people use to suppress 
rioters. They can also kick you hard on the ground. Whenever you see its 
tail glow, you should run. This is because, it it glows with a red colour, 
it is going to unleash a firestorm on the areas around it. If it's blue, 
there will be an ice wave. Your best bet will be to strike as far as possible, 
weakening it with magic, Thundara works best as it can never move, and 
focus on sniper attacks with Focus Attacks. Once they die, their loot is 
really worth it. You can get a chunk of Orichalcum or maybe a bag of Diamond 
Ore, both are required to produce powerful weapons and armor.

Ghost: 
HP: 50
Attacks: 
Flap Bash
A one, and a two and a Ice Wave (Freezes)
Vulnerabilities: Holy
Resistance: All attacks when invisible, Cold
Useful Item: White Silk
Oh, what scary looking creatures you are. The ghosts of Final Fantasy 
Crystal Chronicles look like some flour sack with two red eyes, and two 
ribbon like flaps attached to the body. They also boost some powerful 
attacks. The Flap Bash is not that bad, but the Ice Wave is decimating. 
This must be the Ghost's close quarter defense. Whenever you see a Ghost 
pausing and moving their flaps up and down in a one, and a two and a three 
rhythm, get away from the ghost, as he will slam it down once more and 
release an Ice Wave which deals great damage and can freeze you in your 
own tracks. As they are invisible, they are so resistant that any hit will 
deal only one HP of damage to them. Therefore, you must reveal them with 
Holy, and then you can really make them pay for what they have done.

---------------
Walkthrough
---------------
Man, this area does have a rather skeptical music theme. Anyway, go forwards. 
As soon as you move forward, you will hear a cracking sound. A Snow Mu 
has come to ambush you. Kill him the easy way, and get his money. If you 
are Selkie, you will come to some sort of rock carving with ancient Selkic 
script inscribed on it. It will say, "To those who follow: We shall build 
a road. Let these stones guide you to our new haven." So, they really ARE 
planning to build a new haven here in the swamp. Watch out for crocodiles! 
Only joking. Just go northwest along the path now.

There will be another Snow Mu coming out of the ground, welcoming you to 
Conall Curach. Kill him, and get his complimentary gift, a plume of Phoenix 
Down. Run to the right, and you may spot a targeting ring for either a 
Meteor Strike or Blizzard. Who could it be? It's an Ice Bomb! Kill it quick, 
watch it explode! It is holding a stone of Fire. I guess this is how the 
Ice Bomb keeps warm in such a cool place. There is yet another Ice Bomb 
behind this one to be defeated. I wonder what is all that fuss in such 
a swamp? I get it, so, there is a chest there, see? It contains another 
plume of Phoenix Down, take it if you are feeling insecure, and a little 
unconfident! (Quoting from the Linkin Park song "Faint"). Go northwest, 
and what's that thing that jumped out of the water? It's an ambush! All 
women and children to hide in the caravans! 

Only joking, it's only a Sahagin, and he wants a fight after the morning 
swim. Give him the fight that he wants, and kill him! He holds nothing, 
probably only money. Continue to the west, and hello, what have we here? 
Two Magic Plants. Yes, two targeting rings that detonate almost instantly 
after they appear are after you. Your safest bet is to run alternately 
in front of both plants and hit and run them to death. The lower one is 
holding as stone of Thunder. Excellent, now you can live a Life Like Thunder 
(An Eiffel 65 song in their album Contact) Continue along this damp path.

Another ambush! This time, it's a Sahagin. He is holding money. Now you 
get it, lots of monsters = lots of money! Nice! You will come to 2 bridges, 
only the one leading to the left is usable. Meanwhile, another Sahagin 
will jump out of the water, blocking the bridge to the right. Kill him, 
now! What have we got? A stone of Life. Now you can cast Holy and bring 
your teammates back to life. I am just amazed, how can't the Selkies survive 
with such readily available items? Cross the bridge.

You are back on land again, but however, you still cannot get off the wood 
planks. Maybe it is because the ground is not hard enough to hold your 
feet, and you will sink into the ground if you do get off. This area is 
not empty. You will meet three Ice Bombs blocking the way. The first will 
hold a stone of Blizzard, the second one will hold money. The third one 
may be holding a blob of Chilly Gel. Soon, you will get off this marshy 
island and on to the next solid one.

As soon as you cross the bridge, you will be surprised by a Magic Plant 
that will launch an energy ball at you that will most certainly hit. Watch 
out! Kill this enemy with hit and run tactics. While you are fighting this 
plant, a Sahagin will ambush you from the south. Kill him, and get the 
food he has been holding. You are now on a relatively big island. Let us 
explore it in a clockwise motion. You will first meet a Magic Plant who 
will attack you from the north, and it will be holding a seed. Then go 
on along the shores. Then, a Sahagin will jump out of the water from one 
of the small ponds. Kill him as well. A Thunder Bomb will come from the 
left to attack you with a Meteor Strike. Kill him, and he may drop a 
Thunderball. You will then come to a Treasure Chest. However, the Sahagin 
guarding it will jump out of the water from the left. He is not pleased 
with your taking his treasure. Kill him. The treasure may consist of a 
design for a Magic Shield, or maybe a Time Helm. Then go left.

Two Snow Mus will pop out of the ground. They seem to be guarding yet another 
Treasure Chest. The Treasure Chest may hold a design for a Diamond Sallet, 
which can be kept if you are a Yuke. Then go north. You will encounter 
a Thunder Bomb, and several Magic Plants. They do not hold anything special, 
although one of the Magic Plants may hold a bottle milk. Continue to the 
north, and two Sahagins will ambush your character. One of them holds food. 
You will reach the bridge to the next area. But before you go there, turn 
right, and take a look at the slate. It says, "To those who follow: Our 
new haven is not far. Press onward with faith!" Really? Those Selkies must 
be over confident as of now. Go left, and you will find a treasure chest 
guarded by several Sahagins and 2 Thunder Bombs. Kill them all and get 
your prize. There may be 1000 gil inside the chest! Now, you can go on 
forth to the next area! Press onward with faith!

You are now in Area 2 of Conall Curach. The Area is so tricky that I have 
contributed a map to the area, as shown in Gamefaqs.

Ok, first, go forwards, across the bridge, to an L-shaped island. There 
is a bridge leading east and one leading north. Cross the one leading north 
first. As you cross it, you will encounter a Sahagin from right behind 
you! Kill him, and get onto the horse shaped island. There is nothing on 
it. Cross the bridge. While you are at it, another two Sahagins will ambush 
your character. Kill them and steal their money. You will now be on an 
island shaped like an upside down T. There is a Flan and two Gigan Toads 
here! As the Gigan Toads often cast Blizzara alternately, this island may 
prove tough to secure. Use hit and run to take over this island. The reward, 
another piece of Slate with words on it. The two Toads may also drop Toad 
Oil. The inscription says, "To those who follow: We have lost many of our 
own. Be ever vigilant as you advance." Well, it seems that a lot of Selkies 
were lost in terraforming this place. Must have been the monsters.

You have finished exploring this area. Go back to the L-junction and take 
the bridge that leads to the right. The next island has a Magic Plant on 
it. Kill him and advance across the bridge. There will be two Sahagins 
and 1 Magic Plant ambushing you on this slightly larger island. Kill them 
and get their money. The Magic Plant, in particular, has another stone 
of Cure for your use. You will come two 2 more bridges, so many junctions. 
Take the left one first.

Note: If you have not killed the Fire Bomb in Daemon's Court so that it 
explodes, blowing that bridge up, the debris on that bridge here won't 
appear so that your character can cross. That path is marked by the black 
circles on the map.

Cross the bridge, go past the island, and then go to the other island. 
A Sahagin will come and surprise you. One of them holds food. Then cross 
over to the next island. 2 Sahagins will ambush you by the next bridge. 
Kill them, and one of them will drop food, There is a chest that contains 
money to the southwest corner. Then, cross the bridge onto land.

At first, there will be a single Sahagin Lord here. Kill him quick before 
the Stone Sahagins show up. The Sahagin Lord is just a giant Sahagin, he 
will use Blizzara most of the time. He may drop a Pressed Flower or maybe 
a Remedy. There is a single chest on the other end of this island. I suggest 
you go and get the Soul of the Dragon from it and run back to the junction, 
as up to 4 Stone Sahagins will jump out of the ground to ambush your character. 
Get out, quick!

This time, take the right bridge. You will be confronted by a Sahagin. 
Kill him. Then you will reach another junction, take the bridge leading 
to the right first. You will be ambushed by even more Sahagins, and two 
Magic Plants.

Then, return to the bridge leading north. You will encounter a Flan and 
a Magic Plant on the way. Kill them. You are almost on land. Then, when 
you are on land, you will be greeted warmly by a Gigan Toad. What are you 
waiting for? Attack! He holds a stone of Life, what a lovely welcoming 
gift. Now, go right, and fight the Flan, it has food. Then you will reach 
a junction. Take the path leading south first. You will be on another island. 
There is a Gigan Toad on it. Kill him, and cross the other bridge.

You are back on land again. There is a Gigan Toad waiting for you down 
here. Kill him, then explore the main island. There are Magic Plants and 
more toads around here. Kill them if you wish, but you should open the 
chest, as it contains another artifact. Then, get back to the junction.

There is a chest by the junction. It contains Gil, now, go and follow the 
path leading north. There is another Gigan Toad with a Magic Plant. One 
of them holds a stone of Fire. This makes two stones of Fire, then you 
can burn the creatures in this swamp even more effectively. Follow the 
path, killing the Flan. Then, you will arrive at another large piece of 
wood guarded by 2 Gigan Toads. Move north, and then you will arrive on 
an island guarded by 2 Sahagins. They are apparently guarding a treasure 
chest, and there is another artifact inside. Then, go back down to the 
junction. Then go east, engaging the Flan while you are at it. You will 
find a chest, and then you can go south, back down to the main path. You 
can go left to backtrack and open the two chests, one containing Gil and 
the other maybe containing the design for Gold Gloves. Then go back to 
the right, and you will reach another large piece of wood. Go right to 
get to the next area. But first, go left.

You will wind up on a path leading south again. There is a Flan down there. 
You will eventually reach another inverted T-junction. The path to the 
left has another design, maybe for the Pure Belt. Then go east, and then 
south. You will get onto another long bridge. Move on and kill all those 
Magic Plants blocking your way.

Eventually, you will get onto another island. This island is dominated 
by Abbadons. I suggest you run, but not fight. Only kill the Sahagin. Then, 
open the chest for the artifact, which maybe a ring of Cure, and read the 
Slate, which says, "To those who follow: A haven where the Selkies can 
dwell in freedom lies ahead in the distance." Well, I guess the Selkies 
still have faith here. Now, you can get on to the final area. Whew.

In the final area, cross the bridge onto the island. Now, there will be 
Magic Plants and Stone Sahagins here. Watch out for the Behemoth! Keep 
your range, use spells to weaken him, and then snipe at him using focus 
attacks. There is another slate here which reads, "To those who follow: 
I am the only one lefgt. I can build the road no more. To those who follow: 
Be steadfast in your path. Find a place we Selkies can call our own!" Oh 
well, their expedition obviously is a failure here. Anyway, cross the next 
bridge and you will find another junction filled with ghosts. There is 
a chest to the left. Kill the Ghosts and open the chest for the Phoenix 
Down inside. Then go forwards and you will reach an island wih 2 Stone 
Sahagins. Kill them and go right.

You will then meet a Dark Flan, and his Stone Sahagin friend. Use Holy 
to kill the Dark Flan, and then use Gravity to weaken the Stone Sahagin 
before you kill him. He will drop a stone of Life. Then go north. There 
is another Ghost. Kill him for his Phoenix Down. Then turn left. There 
is a Magic Plant with a stone of Fire, as well as a treasure chest with 
maybe a design for the victorious weapon. Get them if you wish, then 
continue on the main path. 

Kill the two Ghosts that get in the way, and get onto the next island. 
There are many Behemoths here coupled with Dark Flans. Use your sniper 
tactics to kill them all from a distance, and saving a lot of pain at the 
same time. Stop is a good move to use against the Behemoths. There is a 
chest in a northwestern corner with maybe a design for Gold Armor. Then 
go north. There are more Behemoths here. Kill them, and open the chest 
to the south of the bridge. It may have a design for a Diamond Belt inside. 
Then cross the bridge.

You will come to several magic plants and Stone Sahagins blocking your 
way, but always choose the bridges that lead north, the one to the east 
leads to a chest with a plume of Phoenix Down. Continue north and you will 
eventually get into the boss's arena. Finally!

You enter the central area of the swamp, where a Gremlin is surrounded 
by a lot of treasure chests. Suddenly, a Dragon Zombie flutters down, and 
stomps hard on that island. The dragon roars. It's time to fight!

---------------
Boss Battle
---------------
Boss: Dragon Zombie
HP: 400
Attacks:
Lunge Bite
Head Shake
Poison Liquid Sweep (Poisons)
Petrifying Beam (Petrifies)
Wide and Thick Beam
Vulnerability: Holy
Resistance: All attacks when invisible
Minions: 2 Stone Sahagins
Useful Item: Dragon Fang (~261 points)
Yes, they are combining Resident Evil elements in the game. A Dragon Zombie? 
Oh well. The Dragon Zombie's two Stone Sahagins are rather easily dealt 
with while you are avoiding the Dragon Zombie's attacks, cast Gravity on 
both of them at once. They then can bash them to death in 10 hits each. 
This is not hard, assuming that you have the stats I recommended you to 
have.

Now, for the Dragon Zombie. You cannot attack him directly, as you are 
stranded on wooden floats, isolated from his island. This also means that 
he cannot attack you easily with direct physical attacks. His head shake, 
and lunge bite are easily avoided if you stay away from the edge facing 
him, amazing that even a simple shake in the head is an attack!

Now, you got his ranged attacks to deal with. The Dragon Zombie will fire 
a bright yellow beam at you that can petrify you, turning you into satone. 
This can be nullified if you are wearing a Gold Necklace in the first place. 
On the other hand, his poison liquid sweep really is unavoidable, as the 
zombie can sweep it across the entire set of floats you are on. In that 
case, use Clear immediately to restore your health.

The final attack is very devastating. It can take one heart and a half 
off a character with 79 defense. It is his Wide and Thick Beam. This is 
easily detectable. Once you start to see the beam form, run out of the 
way. Then you can avoid damage. It is easier to pull off if those 2 Stone 
Sahagins are out of the way.

Now, it's time to counterattack. The Dragon Zombie is stealthed like those 
ghosts out there. This is when Holy is useful. In such a chaotic situation, 
It is better if one person can cast the spell by himself, and multiplayer 
games will be tougher. Use Holy and the Dragon Zombie will appear. Hey 
presto! You can then resort to spells and ranged focus attacks. If you 
are feeling unconfident, then just use Holy again and again, and he will 
eventually be defeated.

Then, you can collect your myrrh, and receive your mail. 

*****2 PLAYER STRATEGY*****
Oh gosh, oh gosh! What a nightmare! This has got to be one of the hardest 
boss battles for 2 players to have! After all, it is a very tight bnattle, 
with a narrow platform which gives very little room for 2 players to 
maneuver properly. There really is NOT a single way to outsmart the Dragon 
Zombie here, as you cannot even sneak up behind him, so it will be a head 
to head brawl, only that you cannot come in contact with him physically 
most of the time!

First things first, let's destroy the 2 Rock Sahagins around here. As things 
are getting desparate, there really is almost no time for you two to 
coordinate a Gravity Attack to suck away half of the Sahagins' energy, 
so I suggest that you will just bash them with your weapons until they 
are finally out of the way. Then you can turn your attention to the Dragon 
Zombie, one of the meanest bosses of FF:CC!

To damage the Dragon Zombie, you must first reveal him as he is invisible. 
Cast Holy on him (Fuse spells with 2 players), and he will be visible, 
and vulnerable. As you cannot come in contact with him most of the time. 
I suggest you attack with ranged Focus Attacks, and various spells before 
he becomes invisible again. If he does stick his head close enough to the 
platforms you are on. Bash away. Otherwise, use Holy non-stop if you are 
feeling unconfident for yourselves today. Eventually, you will prevail, 
and after a tiring and rather stressful battle, why not treat your 
friend/brother/sister/cousin/father/mother/grandparent out to KFC?

a 4 player game.

---------------------------
ii. Rebena Te Ra [FFCC4F2]
---------------------------
Type of Area: Level

Welcome to this Aztec temple of a level. The woman will say that long ago, 
the 4 tribes lived together in a glorious age of prosperity. At that time, 
there was no miasma and monsters. But such days have since faded. Some 
people believe that this golden age is gone, and will never return. The 
woman believes that somehow, they can bring it back. She must believe if 
she had to carry on. My, what a ruined area!

---------------
Enemies
----------------
Mimic
HP: 50
Attack:
Tackle
Fire
Thunder
Blizzard
Resistance: All Magic
Mimics are well, mimics of our very own favorite treasure chests. They 
first resemble a real treasure chest, and when you open it, it will spring 
into life! Surprised eh? Foruntately, all it can do is to tackle you while 
you are in the air, and therefore, will not pose a big threat to you.

Skeleton:
HP: 45
Attacks: 
Weapon Bash
Heavy Weapon Bash
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Cold, Paralysis
Useful Item: Gear
The Skeletons are just well, skeletons, all of them carry a weapon and 
a shield with them to combat. Basically all skeletons like to make use 
of the element of surprise to get you. You will see piles of bones on the 
floor, and then, when you get close, you see them swirl around in a cloud 
and then fuse together to form a skeleton. Then, you will know that they 
are activated when you hear the characteristic ding sound. Skeletons use 
a wide range of weapons. Some use a sword, some use some kind of a pike 
while others will use a battle axe. They will just hit you with their weapon 
most of the time. However, sometimes, they can jump up into the air, and 
deliver a critical hit to you. You can tell as their weapons become red 
while they are doing so, and that is when you should run off. Sometimes, 
the skeletons will go into a defensive stance, and just hold their shield 
up. You can take the time to score a couple of free hits at their backs. 
When they die, Skeletons will be shattered to many pieces, and may leave 
behind a gear, which can be used to craft an Accurate Watch of an Unfaltering 
Watch. Maybe it is because these skeletons are mechanical. The Skeletons 
in Rebena Te Ra are stronger than their counterparts in Tida by 8 HP.

Ghost: 
HP: 50
Attacks: 
Flap Bash
A one, and a two and a Ice Wave (Freezes)
Vulnerabilities: Holy
Resistance: All attacks when invisible, Cold
Useful Item: White Silk
Oh, what scary looking creatures you are. The ghosts of Final Fantasy 
Crystal Chronicles look like some flour sack with two red eyes, and two 
ribbon like flaps attached to the body. They also boost some powerful 
attacks. The Flap Bash is not that bad, but the Ice Wave is decimating. 
This must be the Ghost's close quarter defense. Whenever you see a Ghost 
pausing and moving their flaps up and down in a one, and a two and a three 
rhythm, get away from the ghost, as he will slam it down once more and 
release an Ice Wave which deals great damage and can freeze you in your 
own tracks. As they are invisible, they are so resistant that any hit will 
deal only one HP of damage to them. Therefore, you must reveal them with 
Holy, and then you can really make them pay for what they have done.

Nightmare:
HP: 75
Attack:
Light Kick
Dual Leg Trample
Fire Shot (Burns)
Thunder Shot (Shocks)
Ice Shot (Freezes)
Vulnerability: Holy
Resistance: All Attacks when invisible
What do you get when you have an invisible horse with burning blue hair? 
That's right, a nightmare. Nightmares are invisible enemies that are 
residents of Rebena Te Ra. Like most horses, Nightmares do have rather 
damaging kicks. They may also attempt to trample you at close range. At 
long ranges, Nightmares can fire projectiles at your character. They can 
fire a shot of Fire at you which burns, a shot of Thunder which gives your 
character an electric shock, and an Ice Shot, which freezes. As simple 
as that. The most dangerous thing about the Nightmares is that they have 
such a high HP value, and yet is invisible. Therefore, use Holy to reveal 
them for a start, and then you can go and slaughter this, or I should say, 
go and flog a dead horse!

Bat:
HP: 15
Attacks:
Headbutt
Vulnerability: All attacks when grounded
Resistance: All attacks when airborne
This is yet another pestilence in this level. Bats in this game flutter 
around, headbutting your characters as they go. If you attempt to hit them 
while they are flying, regardless of how hard you try, they can still only 
lose one HP per hit. However, it is another story if you have grounded 
them with gravity. Then, they will become much more vulnerable, and can 
be taken out with a couple of hits with you weapon. 

Sonic Bat:
HP: 15
Attacks:
Headbutt
Supersonic Pulse
Vulnerability: All attacks when grounded
Resistance: All attacks when airborne
This is yet another pestilence in this level. Sonic Bats are an enhanced 
version of the Bat, they appear blue-green in colour. Besides headbutting 
your character, it can launch some supersonic pulses at you, which can 
stun you momentarily, giving you a headache. If you attempt to hit them 
while they are flying, regardless of how hard you try, they can still only 
lose one HP per hit. However, it is another story if you have grounded 
them with gravity. Then, they will become much more vulnerable, and can 
be taken out with a couple of hits with you weapon. 

Skeleton Mage
HP: 45
Attacks:
Fire
Thunder
Blizzard
Slow
Curse
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Slow, Paralysis
Skeleton Mages, are well, Skeletons who are mages, in other words, they 
are some skeletons that are trained to cast magic on you. The Skeleton 
Mages are different in appearance from the normal skeletons in the respect 
that they are orange in colour, and they hold a very characteristic magic 
staff, instead of the swords, spears and axes of the normal Skeletons. 
Although the golden rule of magicians in this game is to stay behind the 
soldiers for protection, the Skeleton Mages of Tida seem to work alone 
all the time. Most of the time, you will find them hanging around the place, 
by themselves, unsupported by anyone. This makes them easy targets. Like 
most of the mages, Skeleton Mages like to cast the usual assortment of 
spells, like Fire, Thunder, Blizzard and Slow. However, Skeleton Mages 
can sometimes curse you, halving you stats. Otherwise, these bony mages 
are no match for you. Just watch them fall apart when they die.

Gargoyle:
HP: 12
Attacks:
Air Tackle
Fire Blast (Burns)
Electric Blast (Shocks)
Ice Blast (Freezes)
Vulnerability: Gravity
Resistance: All Attacks
Someone must have been to the Notre Dame in Paris and stole all their 
monuments there. The Gargoyles are just enemies that stand on their little 
stands in this level. Whenever your character comes close, they will come 
to life and come after you. Most of the time, the Gargoyles will fire a 
blast of fire, electricity or ice at you from a distance. If you go get 
close enough, they can just tackle you with their wings. Of course, 
Gargoyles are statues, and statues are made of stone. This makes them rather 
tough nuts to crack. As they are made of stone, they are resistant towards 
all attacks, with the exception of gravity. Even so, each physical attack 
you perform on it will deal only 1 HP of damage. Fortunately, they only 
have 12 HP, so 12 hits will be all you need to bring these statues down.

Wraith:
HP: 50
Attacks:
Blue Staff Poke
Slow
Vulnerabilities: Holy
Resistance: All attacks when invisible
Wraiths are some invisible beings which look like mages with brown pointed 
hats holding a blue staff. Although the Wraith has only one attack, that 
attack is not to be underestimated. The Blue Staff Poke can deal quite 
a lot of damage to anything that it hits. The Wraith is quite tough, not 
only it has a high HP, it is invisible. Therefore, you must reveal these 
enemies with a single Holy spell before you can even think about attacking 
him. The Wraiths are particularly vulnerable when they are casting Slow, 
due to their long delay. Only move in then.

Cerberus: 
HP: 80
Attacks:
Claw Swipe
Claw Swipe with Energy Ball
Fire Blast (Burns)
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Slow, Paralysis
Useful Item: Cerberus Fang
No, these aren't those zombified hellhounds from the Resident Evil series. 
Instead, they are some sort of a large dog, with two tails and one head, 
instead of the three heads. These large enemies pack a punch. Most of the 
time, they will release a large energy ball with their claw swipe, that 
does great damage and at a range. If you are at close quarters, he will 
just swipe you, and this also deals a lot of damage to you. However, the 
Cerberus is particularly exposed when he performs his fire blast attack. 
Avoid the blast, and you can get a few hits in while he is blowing the 
fire out. It takes quite a long time for him to move again, and that's 
when you move in. Blizzard is also effective on him, and you can perform 
Blizzard or Thunder on him repeatedly to keep him immobile, although this 
can take some time if your magic stats are low. A Cerberus may drop a Cerberus 
Fang when he dies, and you can use it to forge a Valiant Weapon or the 
Lion's Heart accessory.

SIDE NOTE: ABOUT THE SWITCHES
I have received numberous e-mails concerning the switches. I have received 
maybe 10 or more, just about how you activate the switches. OK, so here's 
some of them, and for your information, I have added an ATTENTION in the 
middle of the guide.

(From Henrik Eriksson)
Hello Alasdair Lo, I read most part of your Final Fantasy: Chronicles FAQ, 
and I think its pretty good with a few exceptions, the things i would 
complain about is the many missspellings and much repetive material, like 
the item description, but of course I can forgive you that, its damn much 
content ^^.

Well I saw you had take Chris in your FAQ and answered somthing you think 
he just had killed the skeleton mage and just needed to wait for his return. 
I dont think he meant that, I think he ment as i have encountered also 
a big problems with the elemental switch, the fact that you need to get 
the effect from the spell, like you need to get "burnt" state on the switch 
for the next door to open and "Iced" state on the switch for the door infront 
to open.

I myself was equiped with lighting belt and frost armor, that means I ain't 
got a chance to procced the way to the boss at "Rebena Te Ra". Of course 
this problem could be solved by always having two accessoaries or other 
affect resist units.

(From Bas)
FirstI would like to thank you for the very detailed walkthrough you made.
 
I had the same problem, and then I realized I had a lightning shield, so 
when the spell is cast, you wont freeze and the switch isn't activated. 
The same goes for carrying a flame craft, when flames have to be cast on 
you.
 
So I had to go back all the way because you cannot drop you're shield and 
I haven't kept another shield.
(From Sean Glock)
Alasdair,  
I have been using your guide to work through this game with my son.  Thank 
you very much, it has been very useful! 

I did find something that may help clarify an issue in one particular 
section however.  Within the Rebena Te Ra section, someone wrote in stating 
the following along with your reply.

I encountered the same problem and was getting very frustrated since the 
red switch would open but no matter what I did and how many times I let 
myself get shot, it would not activate the blue (blizzard) switch.  When 
I was finally to the point that I was about to give up on the level, I 
remembered that I had a Frost Badge equipped and wondered if that me be 
causing the problem.  I removed it and the switch opened fine.  It appears 
that if you are wearing certain types of magic protective devices, it will 
deaden the effect of the magic enough that the switches will not work 
properly.  Hopefully this is helpful for your guide and hopefully you 
haven't been inundated with emails surrounding this issue.  Thanks again 
for writing such a useful guide.

~Sean

My Answer to all:
OK, I have added this notice in this walkthrough in order for future readers 
to know the conditions to activate the switch. Now, let's move on to the 
walkthrough, shall we?

*****END SIDE NOTE*****

You will find 2 Treasure Chests in front of you as you start. The right 
one is a Mimic. Attack it and kill the mimic, then open the one on the 
left. There is a stone of Life inside. Continue moving forward, you will 
find the entrance to the temple is closed. Remember this entrance, you 
will have to go through it later. Now, go down the stairs and go to the 
right. A Skeleton will confront you. Kill him and he will drop a stone 
of Fire as he shatters.

Continue to the right. There are two treasure chests. The left one contains 
a stone of Blizzard, and the one on the right is a Mimic. You will meet 
a Ghost coming from the right. Use your Blizzard and Life to fuse a Holy 
Spell, and then get him. Go north now. You will be confronted by 2 Skeletons. 
One of them holds food. Then move forward and up the stairs. There is a 
Ghost waiting for you at the top. He will drop a plume of Phoenix Down 
when he dies. Then move forward. You will find a Nightmare with another 
2 Skeletons. You should be able to kill those two without getting the 
attention of the Nightmare. One of the Skeletons will drop food. Then, 
go over to that Nightmare, it looks like an invisible horse. Use Holy to 
reveal it and kill it.

You will come to a locked gate, but there is no key, so ignore it for the 
time being. Go back to the start and go left instead. You will encounter 
another Skeleton, which will drop a stone of Thunder when it dies. There 
will also be two ghosts. One of the 2 chests is a Mimic. The real chest 
should have another stone of Blizzard. Now, go done the steps and to the 
north. You should be in some sort of a Graveyard.

In this graveyard, there is a locked gate on the other end. There are so 
many bats or I should say, Sonic Bats around, and one of them has the key. 
Find it and place it onto the pedestal. The gate will open. Go through.

Note: If you are interested another artifact, take the key all the way 
to the first locked gate you found and unlock it. Follow the path to 
eventually get to a Treasure Chest. Inside, is an artifact. There is a 
spare key along with it that you can use to unlock this gate.

You will come to an opening in the wall, blocked by a force field. To clear 
the field, place the Crystal Chalice on the switch to the left, and have 
your character walk over to the switch to the right and step on it. The 
field will disappear. You will find 2 more Treasure Chests. The one to 
the left is mimic, while the other one is real. The one to the right holds 
a Stone of Life. Go right to reach a dead end with a Skeleton Mage. Kill 
him to get his stone of Clear. There is a Gargoyle on the other side of 
the wall. But you can ignore it for now. Go left. 

Follow the path, killing the Skeleton and Gargoyle in the way. You will 
come to another Nightmare. Reveal it and kill it as well. There are two 
passages leading to the next area around here. There is a Nightmare between 
the two, and a force field guarding a path to the south and one leading 
east. Go along the passage to the left first. You will then come to a Gargoyle. 
It has a stone of Cure on its hands. Then you will come to a gate guarded 
by a device which looks like a blue ball on a pole. Cast Blizzard on the 
pole and use your weapon to hit it. The gate will open. You can then go 
through. (There is a chest with a ball of blue yarn to the left of the 
gate.)

You will then come to a Wraith. Kill him using the usual way and move on. 
This time, the gate has been locked with a red ball on a pole. Cast Fire 
on the pole and hit it with your weapon. The gate will then open. Go through. 
You will then encounter a Wraith with a Skeleton. The Wraith holds a plume 
of Phoenix Down. Then go to the right. You will reach another gate, guarded 
by a Cerberus and a Skeleton Mage. Kill the two, and get the food from 
the Cerberus. You will notice a gate locked by a blue ball on a pole and 
a red ball on a pole. Frankly speaking, you cannot open that gate unless 
you play a two player game. This is because, the balls of retain their 
colour very quickly, and one player cannot run quickly enough between the 
balls to activate the switches. Therefore, go right, to the gate locked 
by the purple ball on a pole. Cast Thunder on the pole and then bash it. 
The gate will open up, allowing your character to go through.

You will come to an area with a Wraith and 2 Cerberuses. Kill them. There 
is only one gate that can be unlocked from this area. It leads to the north. 
Go and stand on the big panel in front of the gate. It glows with a purple 
light. The Skeleton Mage rises. Let him cast Thundara on you while you 
are on the gate and the gate will open. Kill the mage and go through. 
(Remember that gate locked by the pedestal.) 

Attention!
ACHTUNG! ACHTUNG! Vanevar you stand on an elemental zwitch, mak zure you 
are knot kompletely protekted againzt zat attack. To activate der zwitchez, 
your karacter MUST haf der status ailmunt on him/her! As der enemiez will 
uze der -ara zpellz, do not equip any special armor und badges. Onderztand? 
(Does dat sound German enough to you guys? Or shall I repeat dat in an 
Italiano accent!?)

Follow the path, killing all Wraiths and Cerberuses you find. You will 
come to a large open area. There is this gate with 4 panels. Step on each 
panel, and let the Skeleton Mage cast spells on you again and again and 
the gate will eventually open. Go through it now, after killing the Skeleton 
Mage.

There are two Skeletons here. Kill them, then order Mog to drop the Crystal 
Chalice, and carry it yourself and move forward. There is a little puzzle 
to be solved here. First, walk over to the switch to the left. Step on 
it and the wall in front of you will come down. Move forward, and step 
on the switch to the right to raise the wall you are standing on. Then 
move forward and stand on the right switch to lower the wall to the right. 
Then step onto the wall. Place the Chalice onto the right switch, then 
run off the wall to the left before it rises. Once it has risen, step on 
the right switch on the wall you are standing on to lower the wall once 
again. At this moment, drop off the wall through the gap to the left, and 
step onto the lower portion of the wall lowered. The Chalice will activate 
the switch again, raising the wall, and you can go and get the key to the 
right. Get the key, and retrieve your Chalice again.

Before you unlock that gate you have passed, lower the wall so you can 
go over to the other side. There is a chest guarded by 2 Skeleton Mages 
and a Wraith. Kill them and get the Gil inside. Then return to that locked 
gate and place the key onto the pedestal. In this new enclosure, there 
is a chest guarded by a Skeleton Mage and two Skeletons. Kill the guards 
and get the artifact inside the chest. Then return to the open area.

Go south this time, and there is a red panel and a blue panel. Have the 
Skeleton Mage cast Fire on you while you are on the red panel, and have 
them cast Blizzard on your when you are on the blue panel. The gate will 
open. Go south. 

Letter from Reader! Chris' Letter
Hello,
     I found your crystal chronicles walkthrough and I was having a problem 
with one of the areas. The problem occurs within Rebena Ta Ra where you 
have to step on the fire switch and then the blizzard switch. The fire 
switch was no problem, but the blizzard switch doesn't work. I've tried 
it in many ways and there is no way that I'm getting south through the 
door. I was wondering if I red this wrong or if there is a better way. 
I know that somethings wrong because the switch earlier in the level that 
is the same thing will not work either.

Thanks,
Chris.
My Answer:
You must have accidentally killed the Skeleton Mage that casts Blizzard 
by accident. Run around a bit and he should reappear, then step on the 
blue switch and let him cast Blizzard on your charcter. On the other hand, 
if your character is burnt and you step on a red switch, the switch will 
be triggered. (You cannot move while you are frozen or shocked, so you 
must stand on blue and purple switches while the mage casts spells on you.By 
the way, you should NOT be protected against the attack, as you must attain 
their status ailment in order to activate the switch, if you want to 
activate a Fire Switch, you must not be burnt, and so on.

There are two Gargoyles here. Kill them and get back to the last area. 
Before you do anything, go left and down the steps. Kill the Gargoyle, 
and then stand on the switch to remove the force field. Then get back to 
what you are doing now. Go south, and kill the Nightmare. Then you can 
get onto the wall of the temple via that large slab of stone to the left. 
Move along the wall, killing any Ghosts that you find and climb up the 
stairs to the top of the temple. Step onto the switch to open the entrance 
to the temple below, then go down to the left and kill those Ghosts there. 
There is a yellow ball on a pole. Cast Life on it and the force field will 
disappear. The chest to the north may have an Ancient Potion. With it, 
go back to the first force field you have cleared upon entering this area, 
and go south through the path previously blocked by the force field you 
have just removed.

Kill the Gargoyles blocking the way and open the chest. There may be a 
Sorcery Tome inside. Get it, and you can return to the start of this level 
and enter the temple to fight the boss.

You enter this room, with a beam running down the wall. In the other end 
of the room, you see a creature that is invisible. It sees you, and absorbs 
energy from those 2 balls on poles in this room, creating a force field 
around him. It's time to fight!

---------------
Boss Battle
---------------
Boss: Lich
HP: 500
Attacks:
Meteor Strike
Medium Sized Explosion (Burns)
Electric Discharge (Shocks)
Vulnerability: Holy
Resistance: All attacks when invisible
Minion: 1 Skeleton
Useful Item: Ethereal Orb (~207 points)
Regardless of how close you are to the last area of the game. This is one 
of the easiest bosses to beat. Firstly, the Lich only has a single minion, 
a Skeleton Mage. This is very easy to kill in spite of the Lich's continuing 
attacks. Now that the minion is killed let's have a closer look at the 
Lich's own attacks, shall we?

It seems that the Lich only has projectile attacks. Although they pack 
a punch, they can be easily detected and avoided as all of them have a 
long charging time. Whenever you see a blue dot on the ground. An electric 
discharge is on the way. When you see a purple dot on the ground, a medium 
sized explosion is on the way. Once you see those coming, run away! It 
is much easier to do so in single player than multiplayer, as it is hard 
to run around with a Crystal Chalice over your head. The meteor strike 
is by far, the hardest attack to avoid. So there.

Now, it is time to fight back. You will notice in the cut scene that the 
Lich got the force field's energy from the balls on poles? That's right, 
you will have to deactivate his force field before you can hit him. Cast 
Fire on the red one, and Blizzard on the blue one. Now, the only thing 
that is protecting the Lich is his invisibility, which can be removed by 
the Holy Spell.

After the Lich is revealed, you can either continue to use Holy on him, 
or just bash, Holy, bash until he is defeated. Although he has 500 HP, 
he shouldn't prove too hard to beat. Once he has no more HP, the Lich will 
spin around uncontrollably, and will be absorbed into the throne. Cool, 
eh? Now, you can watch as your character goes into another room and collects 
a drop of myrrh. You will then receive your letter as usual.

*****TWO PLAYER STRATEGY*****
Like the Dragon Zombie, the Lich requires very tough coordination and 
teamwork to beat, so take note of that when you are playing in a single 
player game. The Skeleton is not a hard thing to beat, but the Lich is! 
First, split up and cast the respective spells on the balls on poles to 
disable the force field protecting the Lich. Red is for Fire, and Blue 
is for Blizzard. Then, the Lich will be left vulnerable, but he still has 
his invisibility protecting him. So cast Holy to reveal him, OK?

The most dangerous attack is definitely the electric discharge. It has 
such a wide radius, that it may not be possible to outrun it if you decide 
to carry the chalice with you. So, run out and let the miasma damage you. 
Cast Cure as quickly as possible to make up for any damage you can get.

Another difficult thing about this battle is that the Lich is hovering 
slightly above around, so it may be hard to hit him using Melee Combat. 
If you can, surround him and slash him hard. Otherwise, you will have to 
beat him slowly, in a battle of attrition using Holy. This is as hard as 
trying to dig your way out of prison using a safety pin. Feel free to go 
out and stretch yourself after this hectic battle. You'll need it!

---------------
Artifact List
----------------
Finally, you will get to see the Item Selection Screen. This time, there 
are multiple goodies to be collected if you have a high score. IF you score 
about 207 points, you may be able to select an Ethereal Orb, which can 
be used to craft the Elemental's Soul. There is also the design for a Dark 
Weapon, which is the mightiest weapon a Clavat can yield. Take your pick! 
Now, let us leave.

Set 1 (Main Gauche, Mjollnir, Sage's Staff, Star Pendant*):
This is the first and easiest set found in Cycle 1 of Rebena Te Ra. Just 
do the worst, get around 0 points and you are guaranteed to be able to 
pick the Star Pendant, increasing your hearts by 1.

Set 2 (Black Hood, Flametongue, Gobbie Pocket, Mage's Staff*):
This is the slightly harder set found in Cycle 1 of Rebena Te Ra. To get 
this set, score about 150 points in single player games, 160 points in 
2 player games, 180 points in 3 player games and 200 points in 4 player 
games.

Set 3 (Chicken Knife, Ice Brand, Star Pendant*, Wonder Wand):
This is the fist of two sets which are common to both Cycle 	1 and 
Cycle 2. To get this set in Cycle 1, score about 190 points in a single 
player game, 200 points in a 2 player game, 230 points in a 3 player game 
and 250 points in a 4 player game. Just do your worst if it is Cycle 2.

Set 4 (Gobbie Pocket*, Arai Helm, Loaded Dice, Rune Bell):
This is the second of the two sets which are common to both Cycle 1 and 
Cycle 2. To get this set in Cycle 1, score about 230 points in a single 
player game, 250 points in a 2 player game, 280 points in a 3 player game 
and 310 points in a 4 player game. To get it in Cycle 2, score about 150 
points in single player games, 160 points in 2 player games, 180 points 
in 3 player games and 200 points in 4 player games.

Set 5 (Elven Mantle, Kris, Masquerade, Star Pendant*): 
This is the first of the two sets which are common to both Cycle 2 and 
Cycle 3. To get this set in Cycle 2, score about 190 points in a single 
player game, 200 points in a 2 player game, 230 points in a 3 player game 
and 250 points in a 4 player game. Just do your worst if it is Cycle 3.My, 
they are basically giving away Star Pendants.

Set 6 (Gobbie Pocket, Noah's Lute*, Ogrekiller):
This is the second of the two sets which are common to both Cycle 2 and 
Cycle 3. To get this set in Cycle 2, score about 230 points in a single 
player game, 250 points in a 2 player game, 280 points in a 3 player game 
and 310 points in a 4 player game. To get it in Cycle 3, score about 150 
points in single player games, 160 points in 2 player games, 180 points 
in 3 player games and 200 points in 4 player games.

Set 7 (Engetsurin, Red Slippers*):
This is the first set which is unique to Cycle 3 and beyond. The other 
2 options include the Etheral Orb and the design for the Dark Weapon. To 
get this set, score about 190 points in a single player game, 200 points 
in a 2 player game, 230 points in a 3 player game and 250 points in a 4 
player game.

Set 8 (Drill, Twisted Headband, Ribbon*):
This has got to be the Power Set of Rebena Te Ra. The Ribbon is enough 
to boost your character's Magic by 9 units! On the other hand, you will 
have the Forbidden Tome Design for Yukes as the 4th choice. To get this 
set, score about 230 points in a single player game, 250 points in a 2 
player game, 280 points in a 3 player game and 310 points in a 4 player 
game. Easier said than done, eh?

---------------
Miasma Stream
---------------
If you have found the unknown element, you can go through this miasma stream, 
as well as all the other streams in this game, without any trouble at all. 
You will see a Carbunkle running away from you as you cross the stream. 
In wonder...

---------------------------
g. Kilanda Islands [FFCC4G]
---------------------------
Some years after you first met Tristan the boatman, he will tell you of 
a new destination called Mt. Kilanda. It is a volcanic island, and if you 
go there, you cannot change party members. At first, you will need to pay 
him 500 gil to go there. But if you can find Kilanda Sulfur on the island, 
you can get a discount. Isn't that great? Let's go now.

You will be briefed by the woman again. A volcano belched its flames across 
the southern sea, and its ashes became a blot on history. Some may be curious 
of what heart they may find in the flaming blaze, journeys they can set 
off upon the shadow's gaze. Ugh! This poem is very hard to memorize, but 
that's roughly what it means.

Mog may complain from time to time that it is hot. Then, he can get tired 
more easily here. To prevent this from happening, cut all of his fur off 
in a Moogle House.

---------------
Enemies
---------------
Lava Ahriman:
HP: 50
Attack:
Flying Tackle
Random Blue Beam (Slows you down)
Fire
Vulnerability: Gravity
Resistance: All attacks when in the air, Fire
Useful Item: Magma Rock
The Lava Ahriman is a red colored flying enemy, with wings that resemble 
those of pteradactyls. There really is no head on these flying enemies. 
Instead, there is a body, with an eye in the middle. The Lava Ahrimans, 
like the normal Ahrimans usually will not attack you when you are far away 
from them. Instead, they will just randomly zap a blue beam around, that 
is so random that it is hard to avoid. If you get hit, you will not receive 
damage, only that you will be slowed down to a crawl. Sometimes, they may 
attempt to cast Fire on you, but that is easy to avoid once you see the 
targeting ring on the ground. When you are up close, Lava Ahrimans will 
just tackle you in the air. As he is flying, you should bring him down 
with Gravity to immobilize him, then feel free to slash him to death. Once 
you beat him, an Ice Ahriman may drop Magma Rock, which can be used to 
craft Flame Armor and Flame Badges.

Lava Mu
HP: 45
Attacks:
Claw Swipe
Tail Whip
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Slow
Resistance: Fire
These are just some squirrel that would barrow out of the ground to get 
at you. What makes them different from the normal Mus is that they are 
red in colour, and that they bear the Fire Element, and hence are resistant 
to Fire attacks like Fire. When you see dirt rising up from the ground 
and some cracking sound, you can tell that a Lava Mu is coming out to annoy 
you. These guys are pretty much of an annoyance to your character. They 
will only swipe you with their claws, or sometimes will do a loop the loop 
and hit you with their tail. The Tail Whip in particular has a knock back 
force, and can stun your character. So, be careful of that. Otherwise, 
it won't be that troublesome to get rid of them at all, no spells are needed, 
just physical attacks, but still they are slightly tougher than the Mus 
as Mt. Kilanda is one of the "later levels" of Final Fantasy: Crystal 
Chronicles.

Lamia:
HP: 37
Attacks:
Claw Swipe
Slow
Stop
Vulnerability: Cold
Remember Maggie of the Moschet Manor, she is a gigantic version of a Lamia. 
Now, you can get to see these miniature versions of her right here in hot 
stages like Mt. Kilanda and Lynari Desert. Like Maggie, all Lamias are 
just an annoyance. They rarely damage you. Instead, they just use moves 
which stop time against use. They can use Slow and Stop all the time. Only 
at close quarters will Lamias use their Claw Swipe. Therefore, they really 
are not hard to defeat, unless there are other enemies covering them. What 
sissies. Lamias are vulnerable to Cold, and hence Blizzard can deal a lot 
of damage to them. It is important for your characters to exploit this 
weakness, as Lamias are quite resistant to normal physical attacks.

Blazer Beetle:
HP: 80
Attacks:
Double Claw Slash
Horn Drill
Vulnerabilities: All Magic Spells
No, this is no new model of the Volkswagen Beetle. This is just another 
giant insect enemy of Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles. Blazer Beetles 
are well, just like Beetles. They have a black shell, which is very hard, 
and he has a very long horn with a pointed tip. His two forelegs are razor 
sharp. A Blazer Beetle does not know any spells. Therefore, he can only 
rely on some close quarters combat, which is very damaging to your character, 
First, a Blazer Beetle can swipe you twice with both of his claws, he can 
also use his sharp horn to drill into your character. The latter attack 
is easily detectable and hence avoidable. If you see the Blazer Beetle 
moving his body back and some red and yellow light on his horn, then you 
can tell that he is about to hit you with that move. Don't ever get hit, 
not only you will be knocked back, you will receive quite heavy damage. 
As Blazer Beetles have so much HP, I would suggest you exploit his weakness. 
You should either freeze it or paralyze it. Then you can land in quite 
a number of free hits before it can retaliate. Whenever Blazer Beetles 
die, they may drop Hard Shells, which can be used to forge diamond armor.

Coeurl:
HP: 50
Attacks:
Claw Swipe
Whisker Slam
Fire
Thunder
Thundara
Blizzard
Slow
Resistance: Gravity
Useful Item: Coeurl Whisker
The Coeurl is some kind of a dog with two long whiskers on its face, and 
a long tail. The Coeurl is yellow in colour and makes the sounds that a 
dog makes. Is that clear? At close range, a Coeurl will simply resort to 
physical attacks, where he can swipe you with his claws as well as slam 
you with his whiskers. The latter attack can knock your character back. 
This is not all, the Coeurl is actually a dog that can cast lots of different 
spells. It can cast Fire, Thunder, Thundara, Blizzard and Slow. The 
Thundara is quite troublesome at times, but all magic spells are easy to 
avoid. Whenever it is casting those spells, the Coeurls will suffer from 
a very long delay. That is when they are especially vulnerable. Although 
Coeurls are resistant to gravity, no one will bother to use it anyway, 
so there is nothing to worry about. The Coeurl cannot suffer from status 
ailments, regardless of what spell you choose. Therefore, physical attacks 
are the most effective against these dogs with whiskers. When a Coeurl 
dies, it may leave behind its whisker, which can be used to craft the 
Wizard's Soul, Charm of Wisdom and the Rune Shield.

Ogre:
HP: 120
Attacks:
Giant Punch
Hammer Attack
Hammer Ground Slam Shock Wave
Vulnerability: Lightning
Useful Item: Ogre Fang
The Ogres of Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles look like some kind of 
oversized walrus with grey armor and a giant hammer in their hands. They 
are really tough, with their 120 HP, and they really can pack a punch. 
All of his attacks can knock your character down, and his Hammer Ground 
Slam Shock Wave will send a very large shock wave that covers a very wide 
radius. Therefore, whenever you see an Ogre slowly raising his hammer 
behind the back of his head, be prepared to run very far away, or you will 
be caught in the shockwave. As the Ogres are so tough, it is not a good 
idea to get into a brawl with them. Therefore, you should always try to 
shock him for a short while with a Thunder spell, and he will be rendered 
temporarily immobile. Whenever you see the Ogre begin to get up, quickly 
cast another Thunder spell to keep him down. Eventually he will be killed. 
When an Ogre dies, he may drop an Ogre Fang, which can be used to craft 
the victorious weapon for all 4 tribes.

Goblin Mage:
HP: 30
Attacks:
Fire
Thunder
Blizzard
Blizzaga
Slow
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Lightning, Slow
These are the mages of the Goblin Army. They can be distinguished by their 
darker color and their magic staff. They are the artillery of the goblins. 
While you are busy fighting the enemies in the front, the Goblin Mage will 
simply target you from the rear and cause damage to you at that critical 
moment. The most threatening of his attacks are the Blizzaga. It has the 
same targeting ring as the Blizzard, and has a wider area effect. Therefore, 
whenever you notice your character standing on a targeting ring, move out 
of the way immediately, and the mage will miss. Once they are alone, Goblin 
Mages are pretty helpless. You can just run into the and kill them with 
ease at that point.

Goblin:
HP: 30, 37, 45
Attacks: 
Blade Slash (Blade Goblins only)
Spear Sweep (Goblin Spearmen only)
Mace Pound (Mace Wielding Goblins only)
Rock Throw (All Goblins)
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Lightning, Slow
The Goblins are the most common enemies found in River Belle Path, they 
have different weapons in hand. Some carry daggers, some carry spears and 
some carry maces. The goblins with daggers have 30 HP, the ones with spears 
have 37, and the ones with maces have 45. The daggers cannot stun your 
character, but the spears and maces can. Be aware of the spears, as they 
have a wide sweeping angle. All rocks can stun your character, although 
they are not very accurate. In spite of the vulnerabilities they have, 
using normal physical attacks will do in this case.

Walkthrough
---------------
You will begin on the shores of this island. Go left, and up along the 
path. You will reach a junction, and will be ambushed by a Lava Ahriman 
and a Lava Mu here. Kill them both. The Lava Ahriman holds a stone of Cure, 
and the Lava Mu holds a stone of Fire. I guess this suits the hot environment 
around here.

With them killed, turn right. You will come to an area guarded by a couple 
of Lava Ahrimans and Lamias. One of the Lava Ahrimans holds food, while 
the Lamia holds a stone of Life. The chests may contain a design for Flame 
Armor and a Zeal Kit. This again, suits the environment of a volcanic island, 
now, go left. Then go up, you will find a urn next to fire. To raise the 
bridge, toss the urn into the fire. Then cross. You will then meet a Blazer 
Beetle. Freeze it and kill it. It is holding a stone of Thunder. Then go 
to the right. You will reach another open area with 2 Blazer Beetles and 
a Lava Mu. One of the Blazer Beetles and the Lava Mu holds food. With them 
killed, you can go and open the chest to get your goodies. There may be 
a design for a flame belt inside. Another flame item. Now, go to the left. 
There are several more Blazer Beetles around here, as well as a Lava Ahriman. 
Take them all down. One of the Blazer Beetles will drop a stone of Blizzard. 
There is another urn which you can throw into the fire. Throw it in to 
reveal another bridge. There are several more ways to get to the next level 
of Mt. Kilanda. Let's take the rightmost way, shall we?

See the Goblin carrying a large sword? Run after him and hit him once. 
He will drop the sword. There are 2 more Goblins holding swords here. Try 
to hit them all before they get away. The importance of this action is 
to be explained later. As soon as you enter this area, you will be greeted 
by a Lava Ahriman. Ground him and kill him, and he will drop a plume of 
Phoenix Down, which is a fine welcoming gift. Keep to the right. There 
are 2 Coeurls next. One of the Coeurls have a stone of Cure. To the left 
is an Ogre with a Lava Ahriman. The Ogre holds an artifact, while the Lava 
Ahriman holds food. Continue to the north. 

There is another Ogre supported by a Lava Ahriman. Keep your distance and 
kill the Ogre from a range. The Lava Ahriman on the other hand holds a 
stone of Fire. Then go west. See the path leading up? That leads to the 
boss. Do not go up there yet. There is another Ogre with a Lava Ahriman 
and a Coeurl here. The Lava Ahriman in particular, holds another artifact. 
Take them out and go to the left. See the Ogre by the treasure chest on 
the southern side of the lava pool? Kill him, and he will drop a Fire Ring. 
The chest behind him holds a design for the Legendary Weapon. Now, go south.

There is a Coeurl with an Ogre here. Take them out as usual, then go left. 
There is an Ogre by a treasure chest. Freeze him and take him by surprise. 
Then open the chest. There is Gil inside. The Ogre himself will drop another 
artifact. A Coeurl may come from the left to help his friend, but kill 
him and he will drop another stone of Blizzard for your use. You will come 
to a path leading south. Go along that path. You will find 2 Coeurls holding 
Phoenix Downs and an Ogre holding food around the lava pool. Then, go back 
north. There is another Ogre to be killed. There are also several more 
Ogres, Lava Ahrimans and Coeurls to be killed here. GO from left to right 
and eliminate any stragglers you find. The Treasure Chest there will hold 
the Kilanda Sulfur required for the boat fee discount. Now, you can just 
use any path you like to get up to the summit of Mt. Kilanda and fight 
the boss.

You get the view of the summit of Mt. Kilanda. The Iron Giant is standing 
impatiently with his giant sword in front of him. He looks aroud, crossing 
his arms as he waits for his minions to come. You will see a Goblin Mage, 
leading 3 Goblins, holding 0-3 other spare blades, depending on how many 
Goblins you have hit in the previous area. The Iron Giant then picks up 
his own sword. The Goblin Mage holds his hands up, as if trying to say, 
"Hey! Wait! You don't understand!" The Iron Giant then slashes him away 
with the sword. The Other 3 Goblins deliver their swords to their respective 
positions and run off screaming. Meanwhile your charcter enters the fray, 
and the Iron Giant takes out his sword and taunts. It's time to fight!

---------------
Boss Battle
---------------
Boss: Iron Giant
HP: 500
Attacks:
Sword Soulshot
Sword Slash
Sword Ground Bash
Charging Tackle
Heavy Electric Discharge (Shocks)
Electric Ground Pound
Resistance: Lightning, Gravity
Minions: 2 Goblin Mages
Useful Item: Red Eye
So, it's the Iron Giant. I remember watching a movie with a similar name 
on HBO, and my, this Iron Giant does look like that one. First things first. 
The Iron Giant has 2 Goblin Mages to support it. Now, this is not a hard 
combination. As you probably have picked up 2 stones of Blizzard. Wait 
for the Iron Giant and the 2 Goblin Mages to bunch up together, and then 
cast Blizzara into the middle of the bunch. The 2 Goblin Mages will be 
frozen solid, and the Iron Giant at the meantime will take some wanton 
damage as well. Repeat this and eventually both Goblin Mages will be killed.

Now, it's time for our character to face the Iron Giant himself. No, you 
are not going to lure him into a series of electric wires or launch an 
atomic bomb at him. No. Let us analyze his attacks now. The Iron Giant 
has 2 different sets of attacks, one when he is armed with a sword, and 
one when he is unarmed. When he is armed, he may attempt to slash you with 
a sword. You can tell when he swings his sword back. To dodge it, do not 
run in the direction of his slash. When you are far away, the Iron Giant 
can launch a large purple ball of soulshot, much like the Soulshot focus 
attack of the Excalibur at you. This is easy to avoid. Keep your distance, 
and you will be fine. Another attack is his sword bash. He will raise his 
sword high into the air, and slam it down onto the ground. This is again 
easy to dodge. And it does not matter whether you get hit or not, the sword 
will hit the ground. I quote the following passage from Horrible Histories: 
Dark Knights and Dingy Castles: "King Richard set off on the Third Crusade 
and took a hawk from a peasant - he said hawks should be used only by lords. 
A mob of peasants surrounded him and Richard slapped one man with the flat 
sword blade. It snapped. Richard just about escaped with his life. Swords 
wer blunt and brittle things for bashing, not slicing." Well, of course, 
the sword the Iron Giant uses is just as brittle. If he hits the ground 
too many times, the sword will snap. Therefore, you can just dodge this 
again and again, until the Iron Giant runs out of spare swords. Then, he 
is unarmed! Ha ha!

Now, when he is unarmed, the Iron Giant will resort to more desperate 
tactics. Firstly, he will do a charging tackle on you, which again, and 
be dodged while he approaches. There is a short lag after he executes the 
move, and at that time you can move in for some free hits. Now, the Iron 
Giant will also pound the ground with his giant fists. Whenever you see 
his fists turn blue with electric charges on them, you will know that you 
will have to run. Finally, the Iron Giant will discharge a large amount 
of electricity at the same time. This move has a target ring. If you see 
a blue target ring with electric bolts on it, run away. This move has a 
very wide radius and can give your character an electric shock.

As for combat, I would recommend you to keep your distance and consistently 
cast Blizzara or Fira spells on the Iron Giant. Thundara will just not 
cut out because the Iron Giant is resistant to gravity. After all, the 
Iron Giant lacks any ranged attack, and he basically will not have any 
effective ones once he is disarmed.

If you run around the stage, you will see some urns of water along with 
some holes with Fire in them. If you toss an urn into the hole, a lot of 
steam will gush out. If you can lure the Iron Giant to one of the holes, 
you may be able to damage him considerably, although not critically, 
therefore I would not recommend using those unless your stats are poor. 
If you really have the guts, you can just run in and use normal physical 
attacks with hit and run tactics. As the Iron Giant is so slow and sluggish, 
it would not be hard to do so.

Eventually, you will have defeated the Iron Giant, and yes, you don't need 
to use the atomic bomb! The Iron Giant will simply fall to the ground, 
and you can have a close up view of his face, including his lovely red 
eyes. Ooh. Lovely.

Now, you can watch your character walk up to the real summit of Mt. Kilanda, 
and collect the drop of myrrh. Then, you can as usual, get the letter from 
Mail Moogle. Send a reply, and you will be brought to the Item Selection 
Screen. 

*****TWO PLAYER STRATEGY*****
For an island boss, this one is not as hard as you think despite his size. 
The Iron Giant is rather slow and lumbering, and he hits better than his 
aim. The 2 Goblin mages are like the Skeleton Mages. They are just incapable 
of hitting rapidly moving targets rapidly, so move in close and destroy 
the two before you turn your attention to the Iron Giant.

Depending on how many Goblins you have stopped on the way up to the mountain, 
the Iron Giant will have 0-3 spare swords to use against you. The sideways 
swipe is unidirectional, so it can hit anything in front of the Giant. 
The downward slam is extremely inaccurate, and is bound to have the Iron 
Giant end up losing his sword. So, you should have the usual distraction 
warfare. Have the stronger player take most of the strain while the weaker 
one sneaks up from behind to ambush him. The only thing you really need 
to worry about is the heavy electric discharge, due to the very wide radius 
it covers, but that can be easily detected and avoided before you suffer 
from shock. If the Iron Giant charges, it's every man/woman for 
him/herselves! This is another cakewalk, don't worry about it.

Artifact List
---------------
There are several goodies that you can bag here. Firstly, if you finish 
this level with about 177 bonus points, you maybe able to pick the design 
for the Celestial Weapon, which is the most powerful weapon that a Lilty 
can wield. You can choose that if you are a Lilty, of course. Secondly, 
you may be able to pluck a Red Eye of the Iron Giant, if you score more 
than 177 points. The Red Eye can be used to craft the Longinus, which is 
the Celestial Weapon of the Lilties. Why, I guess the items found here 
in Mt. Kilanda are basically designed for the Lilties' use!

Set 1 (Engetsurin*, Book of Light, Drill, Moon Pendant):
This is the easiest set your character can come across in this volcano. 
Just start at Cycle 1, and get next to no points and this set will magically

Set 8 (Masamune*, Main Gauche, Rune Bell)

game, 170 points in a 2 player game, 200 points in a 3 player game and

Wow, it's getting hotter and hotter in here. Ooh, what's that rumbling 
sound? Oh! Mt. Kilanda's going to erupt, we must flee for our lives. Arrgh! 
Oh, just kidding, anyway, you must get off this island after you have beaten 
the level. Tristan will offer you a free boat ride to anywhere you wish. 
If you do have the Kilanda Sulfur, he will tell you about the discount. 
Now that if you have the option, you can go to Leuda. He will tell you 
that if you can bring him a Cactus Flower from Lynari Desert, you get a 
second discount.

------------------------
h. Lynari Isle [FFCC4H]
------------------------
This is yet another of those island areas in Final Fantasy: Crystal 
Chronicles. A few years after you have the option to go to Mt. Kilanda, 
you will receive this option to go to some place called Leuda. Pay him 
the amount, and you can sail over there. If you can show Tristan a Cactus 
Flower from Lynari Desert, you can get another discount. Now for the island 
itself. Lynari Isle is a small desert island, with two areas, one town 
and a level. The Town is called Leuda, and the level is Lynari Desert. 
There are no road junctions here, but when your caravan moves from Leuda 
to Lynari Desert, a random event may sometimes happen anyway. Lynari Desert 
has got to be the stage with the hardest boss. It is also where you can 
find the final unknown element in the game. This level is mandatory for 
those people who would like to beat the game for once.

-------------------
i. Leuda [FFCC4H1]
-------------------
Type of Area: Town
Number of Merchants: 2

Crystal Caravan: Dah Yis and Hana Kohl
Leuda is a mainly Selkie settlement, and hence their crystal caravan is 
also predominantly Selkie. I don't know why, but maybe it is because their 
settlement is so small, they can only send two people out to collect myrrh. 
They are Dah Yis, a Selkie man, and Hana Kohl, a Selkie woman. These two 
people like to paint their faces, and they are painted like some sort of 
Indians. They both wear green fur clothes, and if you look closely at the 
behind of Hana Kohl, you will see... Oh! Anyway, having two people in a caravan 
does not equate to efficiency. They always get into trouble. They end up 
lacking money, and will sell random items to you for money. Pay them if 
you wish. They will beg you, and if you refuse, they will blame you if 
Leuda ends up in ruins. On the other hand, Dah Yis will offer to show Hana 
Kohl's dance for the myrrh festival for 100 gil. So, you pay 100 gil to 
watch a sequence of her dancing. No way! Man!

Leuda is the port town in where Tristan's boat will be docked. Leuda is 
rather small as soon as you get off the boat, go to the right and you will 
see the Crystal of this town partially submerged in the water. Now you 
can get to the main part of town.

Caution! Selkie Pickpockets
Well, the game's instruction manual stereotyped many Selkies as thieves, 
and I must say, it is quite right about the Selkie adults here. As long 
as you are not a Selkie, or have more than 100 gil in your pockets, every 
time you talk to a Selkie man or woman, they will steal between 1 and 10 
Gil from you! You don't want THAT to happen, don't you?

There is a hut by the pier. If you examine the pile of sacks and crates 
a hidden item will pop out. You will see a female Selkie around here. Talk 
to her twice, and she will be revealed to be a merchant.

*****KARL LINAY THE MERCHANT*****
Bronze	300 gil
Iron	500 gil	
Mythril	5000 gil
Crystal Ball	100 gil
Ruby	200 gil
Jade	200 gil
Alloy	250 gil
Magma Rock	1000 gil
Chilly Gel	1000 gil
Thunderball	1000 gil
Holy Water	1000 gil
Heavenly Dust	1000 gil
Blue Silk	1000 gil
Fiend's Claw	1000 gil
Fasrie's Tear	1000 gil

To the left, are some Selkie kids who jump around on the trampoline net. 
If you are a Selkie, you can play their minigame. You are to press the 
button combination shouted out by one of the kids in order to jump and 
score points. Score 2000 points and you will be rewarded with a chunk of 
Orichalcum.

Then, go up the slope. There is another Selkie merchant. You will again 
have to talk to him twice before he sells you something. He only sells 
designs.

*****BEH AOH THE MERCHANT*****
Valiant Weapon	500 gil
Mighty Weapon	500 gil
Victorious Weapon	500 gil
Master's Weapon	500 gil
Mythril Armor	300 gil
Flame Armor	300 gil
Frost Armor	300 gil
Lightning Armor	300 gil
Mythril Shield	250 gil
Mythril Gloves	250 gil
Mythril Sallet	250 gil
Mythril Belt	250 gil

Go left, and behind the tent the woman is to find a door. Go through and 
you will end up in a Moogle House. Have the resident Moogle stamp your 
card. OK? Now, you can go up the slope to the right of the Selkie merchant 
to leave and return to the world map.

----------------------------
ii. Lynari Desert [FFCC4H2]
----------------------------
Type of Area: Level
Hot Spots: Earth

You will be briefed by Donna Burke upon entry to the Lynari Desert. She 
said that she met a man whose dream is to find a great treasure hidden 
in the desert. Everyone laughed at him, and told him there was no such 
thing. However, when the woman saw the desert, she was sure that the man's 
dream would certainly come true. After all, the desert glittered like a 
sea of jewels beneath the shimmering sun. You can play now. Before you 
start, make sure that your character has at least 60 in Strength, Defense 
and Magic. There are a large variety of enemies here, some resistant to 
physical attacks, and some resistant to magic. They can also pack a lot 
of punch if you come in unprepared. Don't even think about entering until 
you have those stats. I have WARNED you.

---------------
Enemies
---------------
Scorpion:
HP: 37
Attacks:
Poison Sting (Poisons)
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Slow, Paralysis
Well, this is just as expected in any desert level. After all, the desert 
is home to Scorpions. What's so different about these Scorpions do not 
have just one poisonous sting, they have two! They can sting enemies in 
front of and behind them at the same time. Scorpions like to ambush their 
prey by jumping out of the sand. Therefore, be careful, and when you hear 
the sound of sand shifting, get onto the stand guard stance, and watch 
out. The good thing is, that Scorpions, being the desert creatures and 
all, cannot stand cold. Therefore, the first thing in the agenda is to 
use Blizzard or Blizzara and freeze the foe. Then, they can take more damage 
than when you decide to brawl with them with physical weapons. Don't do 
that, as they are rather resistant. 

Lamia:
HP: 37
Attacks:
Claw Swipe
Slow
Stop
Vulnerability: Cold
Remember Maggie of the Moschet Manor, she is a gigantic version of a Lamia. 
Now, you can get to see these miniature versions of her right here in hot 
stages like Mt. Kilanda and Lynari Desert. Like Maggie, all Lamias are 
just an annoyance. They rarely damage you. Instead, they just use moves 
which stop time against use. They can use Slow and Stop all the time. Only 
at close quarters will Lamias use their Claw Swipe. Therefore, they really 
are not hard to defeat, unless there are other enemies covering them. What 
sissies. Lamias are vulnerable to Cold, and hence Blizzard can deal a lot 
of damage to them. It is important for your characters to exploit this 
weakness, as Lamias are quite resistant to normal physical attacks.

Rock Scorpion:
HP: 15
Attack:
Poison Sting (Poisons)
Vulnerability: Gravity
Resistance: All attacks
Well, this is just as expected in any desert level. After all, the desert 
is home to Scorpions. What's so different about these Scorpions do not 
have just one poisonous sting, they have two! They can sting enemies in 
front of and behind them at the same time. Besides, some live in the land 
so much that they absorb minerals into their bodies and turn into stone! 
Scorpions like to ambush their prey by jumping out of the sand. Therefore, 
be careful, and when you hear the sound of sand shifting, get onto the 
stand guard stance, and watch out. Of course, as these enhanced Scorpions 
are made of stone, no spells but Gravity can cut it. Therefore, you should 
half its HP by Gravity, then bash it about 8 times to defeat it.

Zu
HP: 120
Attacks:
Air Swoop
High Energy Blast
Fire Shot (Burns)
Electric Shot (Shocks)
Ice Shot (Freezes)
Vulnerability: Gravity
Resistance: All attacks when flying
Useful Items: Zu's Beak, Orichalcum
This looks like somekind of a giant prehistoric bird with one gigantic 
delta wing. Much like most of those modern fighters today, like a modern 
divebomber, the Zu likes to perform an air swoop down onto their prey, 
much like those Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers. Watch out as the Zu seems to 
be winding up, as it can deliever an unholy amount of damage to your 
character. Another attack is its High Energy Blast, where the Zu will simply 
let out a large and thick beam of energy onto your charcter, again it deals 
similar damage to that of the Abbadon. At the same time, the Zu can fire 
shots of Fire, Electricity and Ice onto your enemy. This is just as easy 
to attack as those similar attacks used by the Gargoyles. The good thing 
about the Zu is that, like the Abbadon, it can be forced to "sit on the 
ground" while you hit using Gravity. That way, you can beat these large 
behemoths of the air with little resistance. Zus tend to drop either Zu's 
Beaks or chunks of Orichalcum when killed. The Zu's Beaks can be used to 
craft the Speed Talisman of those Selkies.

Cactuar:
HP: 37
Attacks:
Jump Kick
Needle Storm
Thunder
Vulnerability: Fire
Resistance: Lightning
Useful Item: Needle
Cactuars are just well, some cacti that have been brought to life by some 
evil force and have gone bad, unlike all the good cacti that sit around. 
These guys are very agile and very playful. They like to run over to your 
character and perform jump kicks on your character very rapidly, and while 
they are at it, they will cry "Woo-hoo!" Much like Mario when he does his 
double jump! The good thing is, this attack is not very accurate. If you 
see a Cactuar repeatedly attempting to kick you but miss continuously, 
then you will know that you will be safe if you just stand still. On the 
other hand, the Cactuar has his share of long range attacks too. He can 
sometimes bend down, making a cranking sound, and launch a whole bunch 
of needles at your character. They can also cast Thunder on your character, 
and it is very fast. As Cactuars are plants, they are vulnerable to Fire, 
so use Fire and burn the life out of these evil cacti! When they die, they 
may drop Needles, which can be used to craft a large variety of accessories.

Sand Sahagin:
HP: 45
Attacks:
Claw Swipe
Blue Breath Attack
Ice Spike Jab (Freezes)
Blizzard
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Slow, Paralysis
The Sahagin is a blue-green coloured water creature that lives in many 
damp areas like the Selepation Cave and Conall Curach. ON the other hand, 
the Sahagin has a lot of relatives. Like the Stone Sahagin, and the Sand 
Sahagin that are the residents of Lynari Desert. The Sand Sahagins are 
coated with Silicon(IV) oxide, and they live in the sand, and jump out 
and ambush your character. This action is not hard to detect. You can hear 
the crackling sound as the Sand Sahagin jumps out of the sand. The Sand 
Sahagin is a decent fighter both in close range and long range. At close 
quarters, a Sand Sahagin can just swipe you with its claws. When you are 
at medium range, a Sahagin will blow some blue breath to you that causes 
moderate damage. He can also stick out an ice spike from one of its claws 
and jab you with it. This attack has the ability to freeze any unsuspecting 
character in. Finally, a Sand Sahagin can also cast Blizzard on you. A 
Sahagin has quite a high defense, and is resistant to many physical attacks. 
However, it is vulnerable towards Cold, and that's all you need to weaken 
them before moving in and brawl with them. Well, many enemies in Lynari 
Desert are vulnerable to Cold. This has become a popular trend.

Chimera:
HP: 120
Attacks:
Horn Drill
Snout Spin Bash
Electric Shockwave (Shocks)
Fire Breath (Burns)
Ice Breath (Freezes)
Vulnerabilities: Slow, Paralysis
Useful Item: Chimera's Horn, Design for Legendary Weapon
No, these aren't those evil bug like creatures Chris and Jill will find 
in the Power Area of Resident Evil. The Chimeras of Final Fantasy: Crystal 
Chronicles are some giant yellow creature with two sharp horns, and they 
all have a rather long snout. First off, the Chimera can just use its horn 
to drill into your characters. They also can swing their snout around for 
360 degrees in order to hit enemies all around it. The Chimera's horn can 
be used as a pair of electrode to generate electricity. When you see there 
are electric bolts between the two horns, you had better run, as the 
electric shockwave has a wide radius. The snout can give out fiery air 
and cold air, which burns and freezes your opponents respectively. The 
Chimera is not very vulnerable to magic, so your best bet would be to cast 
Stop on them to put them in stasis before you start to bash the life out 
of them. When they die, Chimeras tend to drop Chimera's Horns and sometimes, 
the design for the Legendary Weapon. Its horn can be used to forge the 
Dragoon's Spear, Twisted Scope and the Talisman of Wisdom.

Tip! Gurdy's Poem
While meeting Gurdy on the road, he will recite to you three verses of 
the poem, which, when put together, give your character the hints to finding 
the unknown element. Here's the poem. It may also provide a clue as to 
the order of the casting.

Lightning brings the cactus pain
Of crumbled inn few reminisce
Lonely mushroom bursts to flame
Three rocks await the winter's kiss
In the end shall bloom a flower
Sacred light reveals its power

As soon as you start, move forwards. Some Scorprions should pop out of 
the ground. Kill them, and make sure that you have the Earth element to 
make sure that you don't get poisoned. The two Scorpions will drop a stone 
of Blizzard and a stone of Thunder. Now, go left. There is a Lamia or I 
should say, 2. You know what to do. Freeze them in with your newly found 
Blizzard. While you are at it, a Scorpion will pop out to save his fair 
damsels. Kill him by the freeze method, and he will die to. The Scorpion 
will drop a stone of Life, while one of the Lamias will drop a stone of 
Fire. Now you can burn. Go north now.

Ooh... What have we here? Another Lamia! Excuse me miss, but I am afraid 
I will have to kill you now! Freeze her in and kill her! What's the reward? 
A stone of Blizzard! Great, this makes 2 stones of Blizzard, and it means 
that your character can fuse them together and cast Blizzara. Now, go right.

There is a Scorpion and a Lamia sheltering from the intense heat of the 
sun. Give them the cooling they deserve with some Blizzara, and they will 
die, all cooled off. The Lamia, in particular, will drop a stone of Cure. 
Now, you can heal yourself. Go northwest now. You will come to another 
shelter. This time, there is a Scorpion, and believe it or not, a Rock 
Scorpion there by the patch of quicksand. Kill them both. The Scorpion 
will drop a stone of Thunder. This makes the second found in the desert. 
Great, now you can cast Thundara, although it may not be helpful under 
these circumstances. See the area to the southwest. Remember that for now, 
and to come back to this area later. There will be a flower there later. 
Go north, and ignore that patch of quicksand. You can warp to another part 
of the level with the quicksand, but this is not the one you should use. 
Only one of them needs to be used.

Follow the wall and eventually you will come to another patch of quicksand. 
Ignore it, go to the left of it, and you will find a Treasure Chest, as 
you go and open it, two Electric Scorpions will come out of the ground! 
Electric, this time! Don't even bother with physical attacks, as your 
character will just get an electric shock. Use Blizzara to be safe. When 
the Electric Scorpions die, one of them will drop a plume of Phoenix Down. 
Good for reviving your souls. Then, open the chest. There may be a design 
for a victorious weapon inside. Then, go northeast along the edge of the 
cliff.

What's that big shadow on the ground? Why don't we have a look. Oh! Hey 
look, there is a giant bird in the sky! That giant bird in fact, is a Zu, 
a large bird with highly destructive powers. Fortunately, like those 
Abbadons, they can be grounded by a simple Gravity Spell, and hence they 
can be beaten with minimal resistance. But still, expect to use Gravity 
at least twice, as the Zu has such a high HP. Now, go west and then south.

There are two areas to be explored here. The one to the east has a treasure 
chest guarded by 2 Lamias. As usual, freeze them in. One of the Lamias 
will drop another stone of Thunder, enabling you to cast Thundaga if you 
wish! Now, open the chest, there may be a design for Gold Armor inside. 
Then, explore the area to the west. Kill the Lamia, get the Strange Liquid 
which works most effectively on Yukes, and run into the sandstorm. Go 
through that vertebral tunnel to an area with a hole in the wall. There 
is a Scorpion and a Lamia. Freeze them to death as usual. The Lamia may 
drop a bottle of Milk. Then go over to the cave. It is blocked by 2 cacti. 
Use your weapon to bash through and open the chest inside. It contains 
an Artifact. There is also a hole here. Crawl in for the Moogle House. 
Have the resident Moogle stamp your card. Then leave and return to the 
place where you found the Zu.

Go east, and you will come to a set of three boulders of different sizes. 
Remember them for now.

Tip!
Cast Blizzard on the three boulders, from smallest to biggest. Something 
interesting will happen.

Then go north. You will be confronted by numerous Scorpions, be it Electrc 
or Rock, as well as a Zu. The best course of action here would be to lure 
those enemies, one by one to the boulders so you can take on one enemy 
at a time. The Zu in particular, will drop a plume of Phoenix Down when 
he dies. You may notice a giant cactus to the left, much larger than the 
other cacti in this area. Remember that too. 

Tip!
Cast Thunder on that deep green cactus and something interesting will 
happen again. (This is the first verse of the poem Gurdy recited to your 
charcter, if no spells take effect, cast Thunder on the cactus first before 
doing anything else.)

Then continue your way east through the desert.

You will then encounter a Zu, all alone, all by himself. This shouldn't 
be hard. NO one will come to his aid. He carries nothing of interest though. 
You will also meet a trio consisting of a Lamia, a Cactuar and a Rock Scorpion. 
You know the drill. Although the Cactuar is vulnerable to Fire, he can 
still be frozen in with Blizzara. Burn him with Fira if you like. The Lamia 
holds a keg of Spring Water. Then go directly south, and you will encounter 
two Zus before you hit the wall. Then go west, killing the Zus in the way 
until you come to the same patch of quicksand you found earlier. Good. 
Now, the whole area has been sweeped clear of enemies. Return to where 
you have found the Lamia.

Go east, and you will find some sort of open lean-to shelter. Remember 
it.

Tip! 
Cast Gravity on the open lean-to shelter for another surprising event.

Go south, hugging the wall, and you will find a Zu. Kill him, go directly 
west, and find another Zu. Then, go northwest, and you will find a fab 
four, consisting of a Scorpion, a Rock Scorpion, a Lamia and a Cactuar. 
These four should make up the Aqua band! With them all dead, open the chest, 
it may have something in it, or it may be empty. Go back to the east, and 
continue south.

See that piece of rock on the cliff that resembles the shape of a sandtimer? 
Remember that as well. Continue South.

Tip!
Cast Fire on the sandtimer for another surprise! There is more to come.

You will reach a patch of quicksand by a chest, there is a Electric Scorpion 
guarding it. Kill it, and open the chest. Wow, 1000 gil! There is nothing 
more to offer here. Jump into the quicksand to be transported to the next 
area.

Super Hot Tip!
If you have followed all the tips above, return to the west of the level 
to find a flowe and cast Holy on it. The flower will turn into a white 
coloured Hot Spot. That's the Unknown Element everyone's been blabbing 
about! Now you can go through the unknown miasma stream!

Rich Tip!
If you want more money, go south of the patch of the quicksand. You will 
find a dead end, with a Rock Scorpion, a Lamia and a Zu. Kill them all 
and open the 2 chests. The two may contain 1200 gil each!

You will then drop down a waterfall of sand. I think that should be 
classified as a sandfall. You will then be warmly greeted by something 
that jumps out of the sand. It's a Sand Sahagin! Give him the freeze 
treatment! He will drop a stone of Cure when he dies. This makes 2 stones 
of Cure, now you can make haste and cast the Haste spell! (No pun intended) 
Continue up the hill. Another Sand Sahagin awaits. Freeze him and get a 
Life. Then you will come to a Y-junction. Turn left. Before you fight the 
enemies. Make sure your command list is something like this: Blizzard + 
Blizzard = Blizzara, Life + Thunder + Fire = Stop. Then move in.

There is a Chimera supported by numerous Lamias here. You will be greeted 
by a Chimera. Use Stop and put him in stasis. Then start bashing. Soon, 
his fellow Lamias will come to his assistance. Avoid all the Slows and 
Stops and continue to Stop the Chimera, bashing him until he is dead. The 
Lamias on the other hand are to be frozen in. Go left, and you will find 
a treasure chest guarde by a Lamia and a Sand Sahagin. Kill them and get 
the stones. The Lamia holds a stone of Thunder, while the Sand Sahagin 
holds a stone of Clear. That makes the 4th stone of Thunder collected in 
this desert. The chest may contain a Book of Goggle Techniques.

Now, go up the slope to the right. What do you know, there is a trio here, 
consisting of a Cactuar, a Sand Sahagin and a Chimera. I found out a cheap 
way to get rid of the three. Lure the Chimera over to the arc. Then the 
Sand Sahagin and Cactuar will be right behind the Chimera, who is now stuck 
between the arch and the enemies. You can then cast Blizzara to freeze 
the two foes in. After they are dead, kill the Chimera while stopping him.

Go to the right, and then south. Kill the Chimeras and the Cactuar blocking 
the way, and you will reach a dead end with a single cactus. Smash the 
cactus to find an artifact. Then, get back to the main path and continue 
to go uphill. You will encounter another Chimera, with a couple of Sand 
Sahagins and the what not too. The arch there is another good spot to get 
the Chimera stuck, while you Stop him and kill him. Then go left. You will 
encounter a Cactuar and a Lamia. Kill them, and go south and open the chest. 
It contains an artifact. Then go west, smash through the cacti, and go 
south. There is another Cactuar here. Fight him, and you may provoke the 
Sand Sahagin and the Chimera from the northwest to come and get you too. 
With the three dead. Go south and smash the cactus for another artifact.

Go up hill again, to where the Chimera was. You will encounter two more 
Cactuars. One of them holds another stone of Fire. Now, go north and smash 
through the cacti. Go left. There will be two Sand Sahagins jumping out 
of the earth at the same time. Freeze them at the same time. Kill them 
at the same time! Then, go left. There is another Chimera with 2 Lamias. 
One of the Lamias holds another stone of Blizzard. Take it if you need 
to. Then go uphill and outta here!

You are now on the top of the mountain. Go along the circular path, and 
you will come to a side path that leads to a large sand pit. We will ignore 
that for now. Continue along the path and return to the second area through 
the other side. You will encounter several Lamias. Then, you will come 
to a dead end with a single cactus. Smash it with your weapon and you will 
get the Cactus Flower. That's the discount for you. Now, get back and drop 
into the sand pit. 

You will first be confronted by 3 Scorpions. Wait for them to bunch up 
together and use a single Blizzara to engulf them at once. The sand in 
the pit will lower a bit. The same can be said about the 3 Electric Scorpions 
that spring out of the sand after the sand has lowered. The sand will lower 
some more. Then, you will be confronted by 3 Rock Scorpions. Cast Gravity 
on them and bash them to death. The sand will continue to lower.

Suddenly, a cut scene will be triggered. You hear the "there is a boss" 
music, and your character looks around. Suddenly, the ground shakes. Your 
character readie his/her weapon. The ground shakes some more. Then, 
suddenly, a giant ant like creature with two big fangs burst out into the 
surface. My! So, it's an Antlion, and he is not very pleased with your 
character disturbing his slumber with all the fighting going on. The 
Antlion makes a very loud warcry. It is time to fight the strongest boss 
of the game, the Antlion! Bring it on!

---------------
Boss Battle
---------------
Boss: Antlion
HP: 625
Attacks:
Petrifying Dust Attack (Petrifies)
Giant Fang Bite
Leg Stomp Shockwave
Heavy Electric Discharge (Shocks, if HP<250)
Resistance: Lightning
Minions: 2 Scorpions
Useful Item: Desert Fang
Recommended Equipment: Gold Necklace in conjunction with Earth Element 
in the Crystal Chalice
That's it. You are up against the strongest non-final boss in the game, 
which is the Antlion. With a massive 625 HP, this giant ant monster can 
prove a very tough nut to crack provided that you do not play your cards 
right. The first thing in the agenda will be to get rid of the Antlion's 
two minions, the two Scorpions. I would suggest you to run around, and 
wait for the two Scorpions as well as the Antlion to bunch up together. 
Then, cast the Blizzara onto them all. The ice will engulf th two Scorpions, 
as well as dealing considerable damage to the Antlion. Repeat this for 
a few times until they are all dead. Now, you can face the Antlion.

Now, for the Antlion. The Antlion taunts a wide variety of moves, and he 
is more versatile than you think. Plus the camera angle is very tricky, 
and therefore it is easy for your character to be trapped against the wall 
of the pit, allowing for the Antlion to give you the free hit.

First off, the Antlion attacks by blowing a large stream of dust at your 
character, thereby petrifying him/her. You will know when the Antlion looks 
as if he is taking a deep breath. This dust is a Class 2 Petrifying Product. 
Therefore, if you just come walking in with the Earth Element of the Crystal 
Chalice, you will end up being petrified still. As double protection have 
a Gold Necklace equipped. OK? Then, the dust will just bounce off your 
character, allowing your character to gain some free his right up the 
Antlion's face! On the other hand, it really is not a disadvantage even 
if you do not have both the aforesaid items equipped. When the Antlion 
takes a deep breath, run to the side. The dust will flow out and miss, 
while you can just hit him from a side a couple of times before he stops. 
Make sure you run away right after he finishes executing this move.

The reason why I told you so is because, if you hang around too close to 
the Antlion, he can just stomp all his six feet onto the ground, resulting 
in a large shockwave that may just hit your character a couple of times, 
dealing rather heavy damage. I am sure you do not want your fight to be 
that painful. You can tell that the Antlion is going to use this move when 
he puts all of his legs up above the ground. Then run! But still, it may 
just be too late and your character may have to get shocked once. The worst 
thing to happen to your character is that he/she will be trapped in a narrow 
gap between the Antlion and the wall of the pit. Then, you will be sandwiched 
for sure! Finally, the Antlion has a higher chance of performing the said 
move if you even try to hit him from behind. So, don't ever try unless 
you have a high enough defense!

Oh, now that you can avoid his rear gunning attacks, now, you are to avoid 
his frontal attacks. Now, except for brief moments, the Antlion will always 
try to face your character. Although he will blow dust at your face most 
of the time, he will sometimes follow you around, and use his giant desert 
fangs to bite your character with a great big snip! No, don't worry, your 
character will not be cut in half from the waist down, however, it does 
result in lots of pain! Well, try getting cut into half from the waist 
down in real life and you will see! It is so damaging, that it can still 
take 1 and a half hearts off a chracter with over 70 defense! You can tell 
when the Antlion opens his mouth, or I should say, spreads out his fangs 
real wide, and then, you should be ready to run in the opposite direction 
of the mouth. Note that running to the right or left may also work, but 
the chance of your character getting hit will increase. Yes, like the 
previous attack, the worst place your character could be is to be stuck 
in a narrow gap between the wall and the Antlion. There really is no escape 
if that happens. This is why the Antlion is so tough.

To beat the Antlion, I would advise your charcter to attack from a range. 
It is just too risky to get in close as your character will risk getting 
hit. You should use more level 2 spells on the Antlion. Fira and Blizzara 
will be lovely, but Thundara should not be cast as it has absolutely no 
effect on the Antlion. Level 3 spells are also not to be cast unless your 
are a Yuke, after all, in such a critical time, who would want to stand 
still for that long to charge up the attack? Oh, if you have the guts, 
you can also cast Gravity as the first spell on the Antlion. That will 
take out 10% of its energy, which is a large number considering the high 
total HP of the Antlion. Slowly but surely, the Antlion's HP will go down.

The Antlion, like most of the other bosses has a desperation move. When 
you have damaged the Antlion to an extent that it has 250 HP or less left, 
it will start to use its Heavy Electric Discharge attack. The Antlion will 
simply use his two desert fangs as electrodes, and build up an excess of 
electric charges. Then, it will be a blast as he releases it in one giant 
bolt of electricity. Now, this move really has a long recharge time. It 
has such a delay and once you see him charge, you can quickly move out 
of the way and fight. Deliver a few free hits with your weapon while he 
is still shooting out the electricity!

Eventually, the Antlion's massive 625 HP will be depleted, and you have 
officially beaten the hardest non-final boss of the game. The Antlion will 
then make one final cry and black out on the ground. His body will sink 
into the sand, which sinks with his body, revealing the cave with the Myrrh 
Tree. Hey, how could a tree survive in darkness for that long? It's not 
very healthy, I must say. Anyway, you can now watch as your character 
triumphantly carry the Crystal Chalice over to the tree, and collect the 
drop of myrrh. You can then receive the letter from Mail Moogle, and reply.

*****TWO PLAYER STRATEGY*****
This boss battle is just as hard as the fights with the Dragon Zombie and 
the Lich. As the Antlion takes up so much of the arena, it may be just 
hard for your characters to have enough room to maneuver, and you will 
often end up trapped between the wall and the Antlion. You will notice 
that one of the Scoprions will be made of rock, so you will have to cast 
Gravity on one to such its life out, before you start bashing. Take these 
two out fast. This is just the tip of the iceberg.

Now it's time for the body of the iceberg itself. The Antlion has the highest 
HP of all the bosses in the game. He has a lot of melee attacks that deal 
damage in all directions, so it is not a good idea to sneak up on him. 
So, you should fight a battle of attrition with the Antlion. While he is 
spitting petrifying dust out, stand out of the way of the dust and cast 
spells and focus attacks at him. Then run around and try not to get bitten 
by his enormous desert fangs. Once you have dealt enough damage, the Antlion 
will start firing electricity, as it takes so long for the move to work, 
you can just run in close for a couple of free hits before he comes after 
you again. Finally, you will end up victorious. Whew...

of the world, which is the Abyss. Make sure the element of your chalice 
is unknown.

----------------------
i. The Abyss [FFCC4I]
----------------------
The Abyss is the final area of the game. There are two areas to be explored, 
they are the Mag Mell, an area where Carbunkles live, and Mount Vellenge. 
Before you enter Mount Vellenge, I recommend that all 3 basic stats are 
over 70, and you have at least 90 memories on your character. BEFORE YOU 
READ THIS, I MUST WARN YOU THAT THERE EXIST MASSIVE SPOILERS FOR THE HIDDEN 
STORY OF THE GAME, THROUGH A CERTAIN EVENT, YOU WILL FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING 
ON WITH SOME EVENTS ON THE ROAD. IF YOU WANT TO BEAT THIS GAME BY YOURSELF 
AND DON'T WANT THE PLOT TO BE REVEALED PREMATURELY, PLEASE DO NOT READ 
THIS SECTION. THANK YOU.

Letter from Reader! Chibi Tetra's letter
Near the end of your walkthrough,in the final area, you said that you had 
to have over 70 basic stats. None of mine are close to that and it's the 
7th year...what should I do? 
 
Thank you for reading this.
My Answer: It seems that I will have to change that phrase up there. I 
will just RECOMMEND you have stats over 70. In fact, it may interest you 
to know that for the first time I beat the game, my main character Aladair 
only had stats in the 60s. If you can reach Mt. Vellenge, why don't you 
try anyway? It will be a greater challenge, that's all. (I took a large 
amount of beating even if my stats are at the 60s.) 

As to raise stats, I recommend you to equip your character with Diamond 
Armor, and at least the Legendary Weapon. Then, start collecting artifacts 
until all stats are over 70. Good luck.

In Mount Vellenge, you will just have to follow the path deeper and deeper 
into the mountain, to find the meteor parasite. Beat the meteor parasite 
and you will get to face Raem, an evil person who feeds on the sad memories 
of people. Before you can fight him, you must have a long conversation 
with Lady Mio, and answer 5 questions related to your quest. Therefore, 
make sure you have read your diary thoroughly. The first form of Raem can 
be defeated using normal physical means. Then, you will get to fight the 
second form. The second form is stronger, you will have to use your own 
memories as Magicite to defeat Raem. I will cover this in detail some time 
later. Let's hope you can get a brief idea of what I mean.

i. Mag Mell [FFCC4I1]
----------------------
Type of Area: Town

This is where all those Carbuncles sleep. 

There is a moogle next here as well. At the first junction, go left, and 
then go north. You will come to a cocoon. Walk around the edge of the grass 
and you will find a hole. Squeeze inside for the Moogle House. Have the 
Resident Moogle stamp your card.

Besides, you really will find nothing here but a Moogle named Stiltskin 
and there is a single Carbuncle sleeping in an open caccon. The first time 
you talk to him, he will refuse to talk to your character, saying that 
he is sleeping. However, if you come back the next year and the following 
years, Carbuncle will tell you more about the world and the miasma, like 
how the miasma appeared and how the crystals were discovered. All you want 
to hear can be heard for the following 4 years.

2 years after you first met him, Carbuncle will say, "What, you are back?  
What is a mortal like you doing here? We've lived here quietly for a long 
time-so long that we've forgotten how long it's been. There is nothing 
for you here, and we have nothing to tell. Leave us alone."

Then, in the following year, other Cabuncles will be exposed, and Carbuncle 
will say, "What, you again? Or perhaps I should say" Look who's back! I 
no longer remember how long it was, but a great star once fell from the 
sky. Soon after, miasma swallowed the world. That is when it started. The 
world changed forever, and mortals learned to forget. We wish to do nothing 
at all. Doing something would leave memories behind, you see." 

The year after, that particular Carbuncle will say, "Oh you're back. I've 
thought so many thoughts since we last spoke. You are attempting to do 
something great. So, I should tell you what I know. Long ago, there existed 
a great crystal. People lived in their lives blessed with its radiance. 
One day, a great star fell from the sky and shattered the crystal. Miasma 
spread across the world. That was the beginning of it all. The crystal's 
blessing faded with tis light. The world grew dark under miasma's reign 
of death. But shards of the crystal sill kept miasma at bay. People soon 
gathered around them, and there they built settlements. But that was very 
long ago. No mortal would know of such things." If you talk to Stiltzkin, 
he will reason why Moogles are immune to miasma. His theory was that moogles 
have bodies with structures similar to those of Carbuncles.

Then, in the year after, the Carbuncle will say, "Oh, welcome back. I've 
spoken with the others about you. Try asking them about what you want to 
know. The last time you were here, I told you of the crystal and the falling 
star, remember? Before that star fell, memories that people forgot became 
droplets of life. This dew kept the great crystal shining, and the world 
awas bathed in its light. Mortal folk made many memories as they lived 
their lives. But after the star fell, the water of life touched the crystal 
no more. The great flow was severed. The shattered crystal's shards warded 
off miasma, but they still needed the water. Thus began the journey of 
the crystal caravan. You gather the dew from myrrh trees. In the ancient 
tongue, "myrrh" means "life". But over countless ages, people have 
forgotten the meaning of it all." 

Explanation:
Now you know why your Memories will increase by 1 whenever you collect 
myrrh from a tree! Before the meteor struck, the people were able to supply 
their memories to the world's giant crystal, hence supplying myrrh to keep 
it working. But after the meteor struck, memories were unable to enter 
the Crystal, which shattered to pieces, and the world is covered with miasma, 
with the areas with the crystal shards still safe. Hence began the journey 
of all the Crystal Caravans.

Talk to other Carbuncles, one will say, "When the great star fell, the 
miasma that followed posed a grave danger to your ancestors."

One will say, "You've come all this way. Have you ever thought about why 
you are journeying to collect the water of life?"

Another will say, "So it seems that tings we taught ahes ago have not ben 
forgotten. How else could you have found your way here?"One of the 
Carbuncles will be rather reluctant here, he says, "Why are you here? WE 
aren't doing anything. After all, that is the best ting to do."

The one in the lowest ledge will say, "Ever since the star fell, mortal 
folk have rarely come to visit us here!" 

Then you can leave and head for Mount Vellenge, the final area of the game.

ii. Mount Vellenge [FFCC4I2]
-----------------------------
Type of Area: Level

This is the final area of the game. Are you excited? There is an indicator 
that you are approaching the final area of the game. You will hear the 
woman's letter to her mother, saying how much she misses home, but she 
gets motivated by the rising sun. Then you can get to play.

Enemies
---------------
Chimera:
HP: 48
Attacks:
Horn Drill
Snout Spin Bash
Electric Shockwave (Shocks)
Fire Breath (Burns)
Ice Breath (Freezes)
Vulnerabilities: Slow, Paralysis
Useful Item: Chimera's Horn, Design for Legendary Weapon
No, these aren't those evil bug like creatures Chris and Jill will find 
in the Power Area of Resident Evil. The Chimeras of Final Fantasy: Crystal 
Chronicles are some giant yellow creature with two sharp horns, and they 
all have a rather long snout. First off, the Chimera can just use its horn 
to drill into your characters. They also can swing their snout around for 
360 degrees in order to hit enemies all around it. The Chimera's horn can 
be used as a pair of electrode to generate electricity. When you see there 
are electric bolts between the two horns, you had better run, as the 
electric shockwave has a wide radius. The snout can give out fiery air 
and cold air, which burns and freezes your opponents respectively. The 
Chimera is not very vulnerable to magic, so your best bet would be to cast 
Stop on them to put them in stasis before you start to bash the life out 
of them. When they die, Chimeras tend to drop Chimera's Horns and sometimes, 
the design for the Legendary Weapon. Its horn can be used to forge the 
Dragoon's Spear, Twisted Scope and the Talisman of Wisdom. The Chimeras 
of Mount Vellenge are much weaker than those in Lynari Desert. As there 
is only one cycle, they can never grow stronger!

Shade:
HP: 25
Attacks:
Club Bash
Slow
Curse
Vulnerability: Holy
Resistance: All attacks when invisible
Shades are some kind of evil woodman who is invisible, and is a resident 
of Mount Vellenge. If you have raised your character to what I recommend 
however, their attacks are not really a big threat to you. The one and 
only physical attack that a Shade can perform with you is his club bash, 
where he bashes your character with a stick like thingy. Otherwise, he 
will just cast some spells that can result in status ailments on your 
character. The Slow is not a big problem, but curse is. Remember to reveal 
them with Holy before you start bashing them.

Death Knight:
HP: 48
Attacks:
Sword Bash
Single Arm Punch
Dual Atm Slam
Ground Slam Shock Wave
Ice Shot (Freezes)
Vulnerabilities: Slow, Paralysis
The Death Knight is some giant infantry unit with a large sword and a skull 
on his armor. The Death Knight can attack with a wide variety of attacks. 
First off, he can just bash you with his sword. He can also punch your 
character with one of his arms, as well as slamming your character with 
both of his arms. The Death Knight can also slam the ground hard, resulting 
in a shock wave that can stun your character. Finally, he can shoot balls 
of ice on you. Fortunately, these enemies are just so frail and brittle 
in Mount Vellenge, and that brute force will be all your charcter needs 
to destroy these evil knights.

Sphere:
HP: 18
Attacks:
Air Tackle
Poison Spell (Poisons)
Slow
Vulnerability: Gravity
Resistance: All attacks when airborne
A Sphere is well, a Sphere. They look like some UFO rejects from a sci-fi 
movie. These enemies are also relatively harmless. All they can do is to 
tackle your character from the air. When you are in range, they will just 
cast spells that can be easily avoided. Just ground these balls and bash 
them until they fall apart.

Tonberry:
HP: 24
Attacks:
Knife Stab
Supercharged Knife Stab
Slow
Resistance: Gravity
Tonberries are like Tonberry Chefs, but without their chef's hat. You can 
easy spot them with their fishy look. The Tonberries are always armed with 
knives instead of choppers. Whenever they spot intruders, they will come 
over to stab you with the knife. At the same time, they may just super 
charge the move and make a devastating stab. Fortunately, that attack is 
easily detectable and you can get a few free hits in while they are delayed 
for a long time.

---------------
Walkthrough
---------------
As soon as you start, you will be ambushed by a Chimera. Kill it, the enemies 
here are weak, and there is only one cycle, as it is the final area of 
the game. The Chimera will drop a stone of Life when it dies.

Then, explore the immediate are your character is in. There will be a couple 
of Shades and a Chimera around here. The Shades are invisible, therefore, 
if you do not have a Blizzard Ring, Fire Ring or Thunder Ring with you, 
you cannot cast Holy and the fight will be rather tough. Anyway, when they 
die, the Chimera will drop a stone of Life, while the Shades will drop 
stones of Cure.

If you need a boost in Defense (I doubt you need it), you can go south 
to the treasure chest guarded by the Shade and the Death Knight. Inside, 
is an Aegis that can increase your character's defense by 5. (Note: There 
may be a Ribbon (Magic +9) or a Masamune (Strength +5) in there, according 
to someone with a pseudonym Drak the Shadow.)

You will find two large boulders here, blocking 2 paths. Actually, it does 
not matter which path you take here. This guide assumes you will take the 
path to the right. To break the boulder, bash it with your weapon 6 times. 
It's amazing that those weapons won't go blunt after all that bashing.

The next enemy you will encounter is a Sphere. Just floor it with Gravity 
and then bash it apart. Then, you will encounter a Death Knight. Kill him, 
and he will drop a stone of Blizzard. The chest he is guarding contains 
an Elven Mantle, which raises your character's defense. Then bash the 
boulder and go through the gap.

You will come to two spheres. One of them holds a stone of Clear. Then 
smash through the boulder to the right. You will come to a Chimera and 
a Death Knight. The Death Knight will drop a stone of Thunder when he dies. 
The chest they are guarding will hold a Sakuke's Blade, which increases 
your character's strength. Then blast thorugh the boulder to the left of 
the chest. You will come to another Chimera and a Death Knight. They are 
guarding another Elven Mantle. The Death Knight this time will drop a stone 
of Fire. Smash through the next boulder.

Go south, and then you will reach a grey area. There is a Shade, a Sphere 
with a plume of Phoenix Down and a Death Knight with a stone of Cure. Fight 
or flight, it's your choice. Go right, smash the boulder and run along 
the passage and onto the next area.

You will be greeted by 2 shades. Kill them both. Then go to the junction. 
You will find a Tonberry, he attacks the same way as a Tonberry Chef, as 
you well know. To the right is another treasure chest with an artefact. 
(Note that you cannot carry more than 4 at the same time.)

Now, run to the left. Be especially aware of those Tentacles. They have 
a move that can nullify the effect of the Crystal Chalice, causing your 
character to have no protection from miasma. IF that happens, run like 
mad along path, using Cure every few paces you go. Eventually, you will 
arrive at the next area, which is the boss' lair! It's the Meteor Parasite!

----------------
Boss Battle
----------------
Boss: Meteor Parasite
HP: 450
Attacks:
Long Cord Whip
Poison Gas (Poisons)
Explosion Generation (When HP<300)
Radial Blue Beam (When 150<HP<300)
Multiple Explosion Generation (When HP<150)
Resistance: Gravity
Minions: 2 Tentacles
The Meteor Parasite is the ultimate miasma generator in this world. With 
such high stats, I don't think your character would have a big problem 
against them. The first order of business will be to kill those 2 Tentacles. 
Using my main character, all I needed was 1 focus attack each to take them 
both down. Now, on to the Meteor Parasite. As you may know, he has this 
long cord sticking out that he can use to whip your character. That is 
the part that your character would have to hit. HE can also generate 
poisonous gas from its lower parts. Just equip yourself with a healing 
headband and keep bashing. Every now and then, the cord will get back into 
the main body to rest a while before sticking out again. When it comes 
out, start slashing.

When the HP of the Meteor Parasite has dropped below 300, you will see 
a cutscene, with the camera focusing on the lower part of the Meteor 
parasite. Your character is now fighting a trench warfare with the Meteor 
Parasite, as there are a couple of mounds sticking out of the ground for 
your character to take shelter.

Now, while using the 2 Tentacles as distractions, the Meteor Parasite will 
generate random explosions. Hear the ding, and you will run. You can slash 
the cord again, but this time, it will be withdrawn more frequently. While 
it is at it, the Meteor Parasite will fire out blue beams in all directions, 
which can be avoided by hiding behind those 2 mounds.

When the HP of the Meteor Parasite has dropped below 150, all attention 
will be directed to the bottom most layer of the Parasite. Now, see those 
eyes? They work like a large set of machine guns. They can generate a lot 
of explosions at once. Yes, it's like those gun dances in those cowboy 
movies. You may get hit, or maybe not. Eventually, the cord will stick 
out of the largest central eye. Slash it as usual. Eventually, you would 
have beaetn him, and the Meteor Parasite withers. But you hear someone 
behind you that cries, "Stop!" you are now teleported to another region, 
or maybe some other space, underwater.

Walk around and you will find a gleaming figure called Lady Mio. Walk over 
to her and talk.

Lady Mio says, "This is no place for you. You shouldn't have come. You'll 
be easy prey for Raem. No, you should never have come here. You have many 
more memories yet to spin! You and I will always be bound to one another. 
Wherever there is light, there is shadow. We can never be parted. Now... 
and always.But perhaps you can no longer spin new memories... Just like Leon 
and Hurdy. Prepare yourselves. You have roused Raem from his slumber."

Then a dazzling light appears, covering the screen. You find yourself with 
Lady Mio again.

Talk to her. She will say, "I subsist on a tiny amount of memories hat  
you have forgotten. But not Raem... No!"

Some Minions appear. Defeat them.

"It cannot be! How could Raem's spies have come so far? Run!"

Don't run, stay and talk to Lady Mio. A dazzling light fills the screen 
and you find yourself with Lady Mio once again. Talk to her again.

Lady Mio says, "You see, Raem lays claim to all your memories, even those 
etched deeply into your minds. All that is remembered shall eventually 
be forgotten. But some memories are held close while their warmth remains. 
Such memories are too dazzling for me to grasp. I wonder... Perhaps memories 
that shine brightly are too much for even Raem's greedy clutches. Perhaps 
you might never have made it here without such radiant memories lighting 
your way. Perhaps if your most powerful memories strike Raem... If you wish 
all your heart to return home... your desire will strike him down! Hold fast 
to your brightest memories and step through the doors of recollection. 
Youw will face Raem soon enough!"

Talk to Lady Mio again. "Behold the door of recollection! Behold the key 
to remembrance! Your most powerful memories will gain strength when you 
pass through the door. But faded memories will mutate into monsters and 
turn upon their master! Answer with care! Remain calm and focus. It only 
a single powerful memory to open the door." Five doors, one by one will 
appear. To get through each one, you must answer the question correctly. 
The answers can be found in your diary. Therefore it is essential that 
you will have to read through them. If you get it wrong, you still go through, 
but you will have to fight 2 Minions each time.

Go through the first door, and Lady Mio will say, "I remember when Leon 
and Hurdy came here. Raem robbed them of all their memories, and I ocould 
do nothing but watch. After seizing their memories, Raem seemed somehow 
dissatisfied. I believe it was because they had always focuseed on the 
future and had too few memories to savor. But you seem different from them. 
I sense it. Please, try your hardest to remember everything!"

Answer the second question right.

Lady Mio will say, "I wonder, did you imagine your mother's face beyond 
the light? Or perhaps the face of a friend? If so, then that means that 
your memory of them has grown stronger." 

Talk to Lady Mio again and go through the door." Long ago, a meteor crashed 
down and shattered the great crystal. It warped the natural course of the 
world. Raem was born of that cataclysism. He gorges himself on memories, 
and from those memories anre monsters born. Monsters further the cycle 
by making you suffer. And then, Raem consumes your paingul memories with 
delight. I want to see this age come to an end... I wanted to see memories 
properly spun and returned to nature... I want to revive that golden age." 

Answer the third question right.

Lady Mio says,"I can sense your memories growing stronger! Come, let us 
step through another door!"

The third door opens. "On one hand, painful memories can sometimes help 
one grow. On the other hand, joyful memories can make one look only backward 
and forget about moving forward. All memories are someday forgotten. When 
they are, it's because I nibble on them from time  to time. For I am the 
Queen of Reflection, Mio."

Go thorugh the door by talking to Mio, "Miasma arises from something deep 
inside Mount Vellenge known as the meteor parasite. Raem depends on the 
wicked power of miasma. That is why he tried to stop you from finishing 
off the meteor parasite. The power of memories here is immense compared 
to that of your world. Believe in their power for just a little longer!"

Answer the fourth question correctly.

Lady Mio says, "I sense great strength emanating from you. You are aglow!"

The fourth door opens. "Yes, press onward! Remember the skies of your 
homeland! Think of that wind on your fface!"

Go through the door as usual, "Raem draws near. He is close. But... Your 
memories blaze so brightly! I can endure them no longer... Such a terrible 
glow! You may well defeat Raem. And now, one final question! Focus, and 
answer carefully."

Answer the final question correctly. "Yes... You can defeat Raem, I'm sure 
of it. I believe... that beyond the light, a dazzling future awaits."

Talk to Lady Mio at the door and go through to face Raem! "One moment. 
I'd like to share something before you face Raem. Memories, you see... They 
are like a pack that you carry as you trek toward the future. This burden 
cannot be too heavy, nor can it be too light. If it is too heavy, it willl 
weigh you down before you ever reach your destination. If it is too light, 
you will reach your destination having gained nothing from the journey. 
But memories can brighten your journey if balacnced at just the right weight. 
Stop along the way now and then... to look about and savor the view. 

A traveller grows from such a journey and spins the bdets memories from 
it. Those memories become myrrh and are collected by the next traveller. 
Please, do nto abandon the spinning of more memories. They are needed for 
a stable, tranquil future. Come. We cannot turn back now"

You end up in Raem's lair. "Here he comes." 

Raem appears. "Why, if isn't Lady Mio! What is all this? I see you have 
brought a mortal to this realm. This willl not do."

Lady Mio argues back, "Enough! We dwell in a world of memories. If you 
would eat just a few memories and return them as dew, we could live in 
harmony forever!"

Raem replies, "We may have begun the same way, Lady Mio. But as you should 
well know, I was raised on miasma, nourished by it. Both memories and miasma 
are quie essential to me. For you see, of all the many memories born of 
this world of miasma... the ones filled with sorrow are the most delicious 
of them all. Indeed, the final memories of the villagers of Tida were truly 
succulent. One of these days, my dear lady Mio, you must try some!"

Lady Mio refuses, "You cannot be serous. Raem, you and I are both born 
of memory! We have no need to devour memories, nor have we any need for 
miasma!"

Raem replies, "But that was so very long ago... I wonder if other delicacies 
will ever surpsss the memories of Tida. Perhaps we could start with the 
memories of that caravanner there? I wonder how they taste..."

Lady Mio tries to stop him, "No, you will never touch them. These memories 
burn too brightly for you!"

Raem denies that, "Oh, are your memories truly that powerful? Well... That 
makes me hunger for them all the more!"

Lady Mio says, "Raem, that is enough!" "Fool!" The force field around your 
character shatters, and Mio blacks out. Raem says, "I will let no one stand 
in my way!" Oh dear, it's time to fight!

---------------
Boss Battle
---------------
Boss: Raem I (Morea)
HP: 300
Attacks:
Dual Swirly Energy Balls
Tackle
Generate Minion
Claw Clamp (If HP<150)
Dual Beam (If HP<150)
Resistance: Gravity
Minions: 2 Minions
That's it, Raem has knocked out Lady Mio. This really is the last straw! 
Let's fight! First things first, this form of Raem is called Morea, and 
he has only 300 HP. He has 2 minions, who are Minions. When you kill them, 
Raem can regenerate them almost immediately, but it does help to have them 
out of the way for the time being.

Now, for Morea's attacks. First off, he will fire 2 balls of Fire, Ice 
or Electricty which fly at you in a circular motion. This is not very hard 
to avoid, isn't it. Then, he can just tackle your character when you are 
up close. Therefore, the first 150 HP should not be too hard to take off 
this evil boss that feeds on people's misery. When you have taken 150 HP 
off him, Morea will start taking drastic measures. He will try to clamp 
you with his claws, and he can sometimes fire 2 blue beams at you. 
Fortunately, the both are easy to avoid, and if you have taken enough 
defense boosting artefacts, they just won't scratch when you are hit. 
Eventaully Morea will be beaten. Watch the movie scene now. Lady Mio has 
regained consiousness.

Raem cries, "You... How could runts like you fell the great Raem?"

"Raem... Though the miasma may fade away, you will not perish with it. So, 
please... Believe me." Lady Mio gets up.

Suddenly, Raem performs foul play and sucks Mio into him! "Mio! I don't 
want to fade! I will not fade! Even if I must possess you! Mio... 
Don't..let...me...fade..."

Your character stands in awe for a moment, and then is teleported to another 
space that is all white and bright.

Move forwards. Raem rises.  He cries, "I willl never fade!" Oh boy, what 
a creature. This final fight's going to be tough!

--------------
Boss Battle
--------------
Boss: Raem II (Memiroa)
HP: ???
Attacks:
Explosive Fiery Beam (Burns)
Heavy Metal Slam
Stoppage Breath (Stops)
Ice Breath (Freezes)
Thick Black Beam
Dual Black Beams
Resistance: Gravity
This is the ultimate battle of Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles. Our enemy 
Raem is now some very bulky armoured creature with a halo on his head, 
and a large suction device at the bottom.

This form of Raem, called Memiroa must be brought down before you can damage 
him. You are to hit his suction device. However, while you are at it, Raem 
can attack you with various attacks that can cause lots of pain even if 
your defense is over 80. First off, he will fire a beam on the ground that 
explodes, and will burn your character. It is just hard for you too see 
where it hits, and that makes it very deadly. While you are directly beneath 
him, Memiroa will drop one of its heavy metal claws onto you, and this 
deals wanton damage as well. (3 hearts on a character with 85 defense!) 
The suction device not only sucks, but blows too. It can blow cold air 
out which freezes, or some stoppage gas that stops your character. Anyway, 
hack away at the foundation, and eventually Memiroa will go down. Also 
note that your own memories, which consist of bubbles with your family 
members in them will float around. If you cast Cure on the bubbles, they 
will turn into ??? Magicite. The ??? Magicite may be Fira, Thundara, 
Blizzara, Curaga or an Invincibility Spell. The first three a guaranteed 
to deal great damage to Memiroa, while the Invincibility Spell keeps your 
character invulnerable for a considerable amount of time. So, keep 
slashing!

When Raem is down on the ground, he can fire a single thick beam at you 
or two weaker beams. I am sure you know when they will use it. You had 
better run once you see the beam being prepared for use. The thick beam 
can take 3 hearts of a character with 85 defense, Anyway, keep on your 
bashing and spells, and eventually Raem will explode and shatter into a 
million pieces. (The first time I beat him, it was a terrible battle of 
attrition, the second time, it was a cinch!)

Raem's last words are, "Not yet! Not.."

Lady Mio comes down she is free of Raem! She says, "Now we can defeat the 
meteor parasite. At long last... The world can return to its proper course! 
Raem and I... willl sleep for a time. But, worry not. As long as you spin 
memories, someday,... we willl be reborn. I want you to remember... Remember 
me from time to time. O keepers of the crystal..."

Lady Mio turns into a crystal.

"Thank you."

You are brought back to the Meteor Parasite's chamber. Its HP is dropping. 
Deal the last blow and it is dead for sure!

A strong beam of light shines out of the Meteor Parasite's corpse, then 
it spreads all around the world, from Tida to Veo Lu Sluice, to the Fields 
of Fum, where a Clavat girl and a boy watch as the miasma disappear with 
their father. Then, you see River Belle Path as it is cleared of Miasma, 
and Tristan the boatman smiling as the miasma fades. Finally, your 
character returns to his/her village and is warmly greeted by the 
villagers.

The credits will roll. This is the end! You can hear Donna Burke sing the 
closing theme. Your main character will walk to the left, and you will 
see many of the characters you met in the game walking around. Finally, 
your 3 other most used characters will come with you holding their torches.

5. Letters from Family and Friends [FFCC5]
-------------------------------------------
Whenever you defeat a boss and collect a drop of myrrh, you will receive 
a letter from your family or some friend you met in the adventure. In some 
rare cases, letters can be picked up from some hidden place like in the 
tree stump of Tida. This section of the guide gives you some idea of what 
letters you character will receive and how you should respond to them. 
Of course, I would not repeatedly type all those "Vegetable seed" mails!

-------------------
Letters to Aladair 
-------------------
To our caravan from Roland
How is everything? You may be facing hardships that drag your spirits down. 
But always remember that the caravan gives hope to use all. May you return 
safely, Aladair!
Explanation: 
This is the first letter you will receive, and it is from Roland, your 
village elder. He will give your first character encouragement all the 
time.

Mother's worries from Christie
So how does it feel to be out on the road? We miss you very much.
Is there anything you need out ther? Don't hesitate to ask for anything 
you need, all right?
Explanation: 
You will get to choose 3 things from your mother after you have left home: 
Gil, Food or Love. Pick the one you like. I don't care.

Likes and Dislikes from Christie
You need more food? You're not being picky, now, are you?
Here's your favorite, striped apple.
But you should try some different things every now and then!
Explanation:
This is the direct consequence of telling your mother that you want food. 
She will send you a food item that you would like the least. Check your 
food preferences from the Favorites menu to find out what will be sent.

I'm sorry from Ramsey
Sorry! I should be in the caravan instead of you. But if I left now, you 
know that you our home would go under before the village does. How is the 
journey? Write back soon!
Explanation:
Of course, show him some understanding and you can improve your 
relationship with your brother/sister (brother, in this case.)

I'm worried from Paulie
How's the journey, Brother? Are you eating well? Are you getting along 
with the others? I'm quite worried since I know how careless you can be. 
I'm sending you something, I hope it proves useful!
Explanation:
Of course, show your gratitude to your much younger brother/sister and 
your relationship with him/her will increase.

Marr's Pass from Christie
When you reach the pass, don't forget to drink the water. I hear it's the 
finest! It may have a bad aftertaste, but you know that means it's good 
for you!
Explanation:
Promise to try the water and your relationship will improve.

The Jegon form Arion
How are you doing, Aladair? I heard that the Jegon River dried up. 
Grandfather once told me that it happened a long time ago, too. I don't 
remember what he said we should do.
Explanation:
This is significant as in the middle of the game, the Jegon River will 
dry up, and you cannot cross the river to the other side for the time being. 
Refer to the tips in the strategy guide to refill the river.

Fields of Fum from Christie
I hear that the striped apples from the farm are much better than the ones 
on the market! If I recall correctly, star carrots and gourd potatoes were 
their specialties.
Explanation:
Again, promise that you will try the specialties.

Shella form Christie
I definitely recommend the rainbow grapes. There's alsothis mysterious 
liquid, but there is no way I am going to drink that. I can tell that I'll 
get sick from it just by that awful scent and taste.

Hurt his back from Christie
Father's back went out again. He's so stubborn, he won't take any medicine 
at all! I just read the other day that orc belts are good for the back, 
but I can't get a hold of one.
Explanation:
I am not sure how you should reply to this letter, but my guess is that 
sending an Orc's Belt can improve relations.

So difficult from Christie
I told your father that I sent you a letter and he got so furious! Then 
his back suddenly got better. Oh men...

Your happiness from Hurdy
If you had one wish that would grant you happiness, what would you wish 
for? What is happiness to you?
Explanation:
Hurdy is that really tall preacher that you have met on the road. He has 
an alter ego, Gurdy who is a fraud. But Gurdy will recite some verses to 
hint at how to find the unknown element. Just choose a random option and 
the letter below will be sent to you.

Be happy from Hurdy
I will grant you happiness. But think hard about what happiness really 
means to you.

My bad! From Ramsey
Say, do you remember that frothy milk you were looking for before you left? 
To tell the truth, I drank it all. I'm really sorry! Here, I'm sending 
you your favorite snack, so forgive me!
Explanation: 
Show your forgiveness in this letter and your relationship will improve.

Never seen before form Ramsey
I found a shiny shard near the house. It looks like jewelry, but I wonder 
if it's real. What do you think?
Explanation:
Tell him that you think it's real.

Vegetable Seed from Ramsey
You know that vegetable seed you sent? We already planted some. Do you 
want us to take them out and plant the new one?
Explanation: 
This is what you get when you send a seed home. Of course, ask them to 
take them out and plant the new one.

You tricked me! From Ramsey
It was fake! You made me look like a fool!
Explanation: 
If this appears, then apologize. It's common sense.

Help! From Arion
I'm afraid I have bad news. Your mother is ill and we need money for the 
doctor! I'm sorry, but can you send us 11410 gil right away?
Explanation:
This is a letter that you will have to be very careful in replying. Even 
if you say that you will send money, you MUST manually select send gil 
from the manual, and send the required amount, which is 11410 in this case. 
Otherwise, no money will be sent, and your relationship with your family 
will drop to the rock bottom, resulting in the letter below.

Breaks my heart from Arion
Aladair, do we mean so little to you? This really breaks my heart.

It went by so fast from Arion
Hey, Aladair, how are you doing? I'm doing great. It's already been a year 
since you left. Are ou coming back anytime soon? Well, when you come back 
don't forget to bring me something.
Explanation:
Promise your father that you will come back. Send him anything you wish.

Flowers form Rashe
I hope the world is covered with flowers someday.
Explanation:
Rashe is the Clavat woman you will meet standing by a bed of flowers in 
Marr's Pass. She loves flowers, so state your agreement in this letter.

All grown up from Christie
I heard talk that you were in Shella. You are such a long way from home, 
and I'm very proud of how much you've grown. But I wonder if you miss us 
at all.
Explanation: 
Of course, state that you miss your family!

The first time from Emma
I've always wanted to write to a caravanner! I even got to touch the moogle 
when I handed him the letter! Everyone was envious that I wrote to a 
caravanner! Take care!
Explanation:
Be polite and show your understanding. My guess is that Emma is a resident 
of Shella. (I forgot where I have found her.)

What should I do? From Arion
Paulie won't listne to a word I say these days! I just don't understand 
girls her age.
Explanation:
Tell your father that it is just a stage. (Common sense!)

Oh really? From Arion
Oh, so it's just a stage, then? I hope I can buy her some candy like before!
Explanation:
Give your father encouragement in raising his daughter.

No more apples from Eddie
Although I'm growing apples at home now, I think I'll grow something selse 
once I ingert the land.
I've never grown anything but apples, though. I wonder what else is out 
there.
Explanation:
Eddie is one of those apple farmers from the Fields of Fum. Give him 
encouragement in your letter.

Found something from Christie
I was cleaning your room the other day, and I dfound something strange. 
It's labeled "legendary werapon."
I think you brought it home when you were little. Do you still want it?
Explanation:
The Legendary Weapon of a tribe is often the tribe's second most or third 
most powerful weapon. If your mother does find it, of course tell her you 
want it!

I'm sending it from Christie
I don't know what you're planning to do with it, but I'll send it all the 
same. I hope it comes in handy.
Explanation:
What are you waiting for? Thank your mother!

From Shella from Eleanor
I hear stories about you from Amidatty all the time. According to him, 
you possess an energy that defies all logic. Perhaps you're even more of 
an oddball than Amidatty.
Explanation:
Eleanor is one of the Yuke women that you will find on the main island 
of Shella. Admit that you are more of an oddball than Amidatty.

The blue sea form Carl Messa
Do you remember me? I saved up some money and took a boat trip far out 
to sea. I was so impressed seeing the ocean stretch to the horizon!

An apology from Mephonge
I apologize for the other week. I was nervous training under the watchful 
eyes of my professor,m but also I am shy hile meeting strangers. I hope 
I caused you no offense.

I'm glad form Methonge
Really? Thank you. I can organize my thoughts more easily when writing 
a letter. But I must work on my speaking skills, because one day I will 
be a teacher!

Your kindness from Arion
Thank you, Aladair. I really appreciate what you did. Your mother is better 
now. She said she wanted to see you again soon.
Explanation: This is the consequence if you do send home the Gil to help 
your mother get cured from her illness.

Empty chair form Arion
Every night at the dinner table I stare at the empty seat where you once 
sat, and my eyes fill with tears.
We may not be together at the table, but our family is alwys one. Take 
care.
Explanation: 
Show your father that you do miss him.

Groceries from Christie
Meat	3 slices
Milk	1 bottle
Bannock	1 loaf
Round corn	2 cobs
Explanation: 
Well, this sometimes occurs, and even if you buy all the things she asks, 
she will not ask for them! The recommended reply would be, "Where's the 
letter?"

Heir from Arion
You're the son of a blacksmith; lets see how good you are. Send me a chunk 
of bronze of high quality.
Explanation:
This can only be received if you are the son of a blacksmith. Do as you 
are told. Same goes for the other 2 letters from your father below.

When you were born from Christie
How many years have gone since I hgave birth to you? You were frail at 
first, so I was deeply worried. But you've grown so strong, prerhaps I 
worried too much.
Explanation:
Show your understanding in your reply.

I see from Arion
That was some fine bronze you sent.
Now let's see a chunk of iron.

Very good from Arion
Was it hard to find a chunk of iron?
You'll be a blacksmith someday! Try sending a chunk of mythril this time.

Relieved from Arion
Very ghood! You'll be a fine smith someday!
Now I can focus on my craft, for you've pu my mind at ease.

Good heavens from Morris
I have to sell the calf! I never thought I'd be torn from her. IF only 
we had a little more money, we wouldn't have to sawell her.
Explanaion: 
Some time after you buy a cow from Morris, he will send you the following 
letters. Reply as you wish.

Yes. Frrom Morris
I know. I know how it is. I know that I have to do this for our livelihood. 
But I can't just hlet her go so easily.

Thank you from Morris
Thank you so much! Thanks to you, we don't need to sell her! Here, take 
this as a toekn of my gratitude.

Grown-up from Paulie
Listen to this! I tried a cob of round corn for the first time today!
It tasted very strange, but I ate it all! Aren't you proud of me!
Explanation:
If there is something that little kids like, it's encouragement. 
Congratulate your sister for willing to try.

The best from Sean
This year's gourd potatoes were so good, I've decided to send you some. 
I know that caravanning is hard work, but I wish you the best!
Explanation:
This is a letter from one of the farmers of the Fields of Fum. I just appeared 
to talk to him a couple of times and he wrote this letter to Aladair,

----------------
Letters to Paul
----------------
Your flower from Foo Kloo
There is something that I've been waiting to tell you. The flower that 
you used to take care of has died. By the time I noticed, it was too late. 
I'm really sorry.
Explanation:
To improve your relationship with your younger sister, tell her that you 
forgive her.

New flower from Foo Kloo
Thanks for thinking of me, but I don't want to trouble you. So I went and 
bought a seed for a new flower. It should bloom in no time. I hope you 
like it!
Explanation:
As in above, express your interest and appreciation in the new flower your 
sister bought for you.

To live from Wam Soo
The Selkic Code

First, get the food. Second, get the gil. Third, get the items. Last, but 
not least, get others to defeat your enemies for you. That's how it's done!
Explanation:
This is just another example of how the Selkies place their interests above 
all else. Of course, give your mother the impression that you understand 
the code.

No regrets from Gila Moo
In life there is much more failure than success. So make sure that even 
when you make a mistake, you can live life wihtout regret.
Explanation:
This letter and the following two are consequential with each other. In 
each case, show approval with your parent.

However... form Wam Soo
It's fine to not regret your mistakes, but you should reflect on them 
someitmes.
Otherwise, you could end up a failure your father.

Refelct on them from Gila Moo
I guess my words are not so convincing with all the mistakes that I've 
made, huh? I get worried, but I never regret anything, I refelct on them 
and this is my proof.

Take it slow form Wam Soo
Hello, Paul, are you well? I hope you're not getting caught up with some 
strange girl, or are you? Before you bring her home, make sure that she's 
pretty and works hard, just like me.
Explanation: 
I forgot what choices in replying your character has, but I think you should 
agree with your mother and tell her that you have no girl in your sights.

Where moogles sleep form Deh Tiy
Mother told me that moogles sleep in trees, but I think they'd fall.
Tell me, can it really be true?
Explanation: 
Wow, your much younger brother does have a very wild imagination. Of course, 
to improve your relationship with him, say that it can be true.

Oh... form Deh Tiy
How dull! They sleep like everyone else! Don't you think it would be much 
more fun if they slept underwater or inside a burning flame?
Explanatoin:
Wow, this is really getting serious, but tell your sadistic brother that 
it WILL be fun, and he will be happy.

It's tough from Wam Soo
You need to come back to Tipa as soon as you can! Your father fell off 
the roof and hurt himself badly!
Explanation:
Tell your mother you will, of course, to show that you care.

Don't worry form Gila Moo
I guess your mother panicked and sent you a letter, but there's really 
nothing to worry about. It's really only a little scratch so don't caome 
home in the middle of your journey!
Explanation:
OK, so your father was not ill at all. Then tell him that you understand.

From your mother from Wam Soo
Your diary must be packed with accounts of all your experiences on the 
road. Try flpping through it now and then. Perhaps you'll find somehthing 
you'd never noticed before.
Explanation:
Tell your mother that you will, and relationship can be improved.

See? From Wam Soo
See? I told you. I'm your mpther, after all.
I suppose that's something you just can't do.
Explanation:
Yes, yes, your parents are always right in this game. You now the drill.

Mother's Story from Wam Soo
We are capable of visiting both the future and the past. Our memories take 
us back, while our hopes give us a glimpse of what may come. That is why 
the present is so important.
Explanation:
Again, your reply must show your understanding towards your mother's idea.

Tell me a story! From Deh Tiy
Tell me of your adventures, Brother! Life here in the village is so dull. 
I would love to hear one of your tales!
Explanation:
It's your little brother again. He wants to hear one of your stories. IF 
I had remembered correctly, there is one option that says something like 
"Once upon a time...", select that.

Hard Heads? From Dah Yis
I saw that caravan of three Lilties just now! The way they bounce the chalice 
on their heads, I thought that they had thick skulls or something. But 
they were just wearing helmets!
Explanation:
It's the leader of the 2-person caravan from Leuda. Well, I guess Selkies 
like to communicate with other Selkies.

I'll try, too! From Deh Tiy
Hey, I heard you've slain a hundred monsters! You're amazing! Someday I'm 
going to be just like you! Watch me train hard! I'll become as strong as 
you are!
Explanation:
Show your confidence in your little brother. What little kids need these 
days is a little encouragement.

Good Heavens from Morris
I have to sell the calf! I never thought I'd be torn from her. IF only 
we had a little more money, we wouldn't have to sell her.
Explanation:
Oh dear! Morris is suffering from anxiety attacks since you have bought 
the cow from him!

Yes from Morris
I know. I know how it is. I know that I have to do this for our livelihood.
But I can't just let her go so easily!

Your friends from Deh Tiy
How are you, Paul? It must be stressful out there. I know that you can 
be shy, so I'm worried about how you're getting along with the others.
Explanation: 
Shy, sh? Reassure your brother that you are betting along with everyone 
out there, and that you are NOT shy.

Brand New Letter (Letter You Found)
After all this time, we can finally be together. No one will ever come 
between us!
Explanation:
This is just the second letter given to you from Cecil in Tida after you 
have shown him the letter. (The 1st letter is in Joyce's hands.) This just 
displays the love between a caravenner and a villager. I guess both are 
dead by now.

Really from deh Tiy
Are you really all right, Paul?
I worry about you so much, I'ts making me ill.
Explanation:
Your little brother is having an anxiety attack, better call a child 
psychologist! Nah, all you need is a reply saying that you are feeling 
fine and that will do.

Good Luck form Gila Moo
While you journey onward through danger, I am in no position to simply 
wish you luck. But no other words come to mind. So, good luck!
Explanation:
Your father wishes you good luck, so thank him!

In the city from Gi Lubeh
It's been so long ince I've seen you. Just the other day I saw someone 
that looked like you, but I didn't want to look foolish if it wasn't. But 
I'll be sure to say hello next time!
Explanation:
Gi Lubeh must have been one of the residents of Alfitaria.

Hello from Nadie
Hello. My naeme is Nadie. Every since I saw you here in Fum, I've wantwed 
to know more about you. Could you please write back to me?
Explanation:
Nadie is the little Clavat girl you find in the Fields of Fum, her parents 
are apple farmers, but when you talk to her, she will just say how they 
can catch the apple thief.

I want to see you! From Nadie
I've been reading your reply over and ober/ I can't get you out of my mind. 
What am I dto do? I must see you again. Come and see me, won't you?

I can't wait from Nadiie
Oh, thank you! I'll be counting the moments, so come see me right away!
Right away, please?

A quiet home form Wam Soo
I always thought it was so noisy in the house when you were here. But since 
you've been gone, it's too quiet. Well, sometimes it's nice to have some 
quiet, I suppose.
Explanation:
This is another of those "I miss you letters" from your parents.

Makes me sad from Wam Soo
It's been a while since you left, but I still find myself buying your 
favorites things. I'm sorry I can't let go. I'm sending you what I bought, 
so I hope you like it.
Explanation: 
Here, your mother will send you your favorite food, so thank her.

--------------------
Letters from De Nam
--------------------
Remember that guy called De Nam who you have met in Shella? He's going 
to Conall Curach to investigate. He will send 6 letters to your character 
who spoke to him. This may spoil the plot, SO DO NOT READ THE 9 LETTERS 
BELOW UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE SPOILED. It does not really matter how you 
reply to the letters.

1. I'll check it out
There may be some clues in Conall Curach. I shall go and take a loiok.

2. Evidence
Unfortunately, I couldn't find any clues. My research on the miasma and 
monsters has come to a halt. I don't think I can do this any longer.

3. I tried, but...
Monsters and miasma. Monsters and miasma. I tried and I tried, but it's 
just too much. Maybe it's a task that's just beyond my ability...

4. Figured it out
I think I figured it out. We don't get along with the miasma because we 
try to get rid of it. Take a look at the monsters. Why do you think they 
can live for som long in the miasma?

5. I knew it!
Just as I suspected! The monsters are immune to the miasma! That means 
that they get along with the miasma.

6. The water here
After some research, I'e figured out that the water here contains a fair 
amount of miasma. If I can gradually adapt to the water, maybe we can all 
develop a resistance to miasma.

7. I can do this
It's been a while since I've started drinking the water here. Living off 
water tainted with miasma brings constant pain, but as long as I can get 
through this...

8. I'm doing well
I am doing well. Slowly but surely, I am adapting to it.
Just a little longer and then I'll truly be free.

9. You come, too.
Yes, Co e ov r here.

Yo w ll f nd me a C nal Cura h.

Hu ry. I  m wai ing f  r  ou.

Explanation:
De Nam's theory was that people are poisoned by the miasma because they 
were trying to get rid of it. De Nam most likely died a slow and painful 
death having tried to adapt to the miasma. Drinking water like this is 
like taking drugs! Besides, it seems that humans can never adapt to miasma. 
Once they do, they will turn into a monster! I bet the next letter will 
say, "Itchy Itchy Scott came ugly face so killed him. Tasty." Much like 
in Resident Evil! When you visit Conall Curach after having received the 
9th letter, you will find a monster that drops a Worn Bandanna. The Worn 
Bandanna has De Nam's name on it. Oh dear... That's the problem with you 
people trying to imitate Dr. Jekyll.

--------------------
6. My Diary [FFCC6]
--------------------
As everyone knows, this game is called Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles. 
You will write down your experiences in the Crystal Chronicles, which is 
your diary. I noticed that there is a limitation in the number of pages 
of the diary. Must be due to an accidental or intentional design to save 
space. Your diary can only take up 256 pages. After that, all new events 
will not be noted down. Although your memories will continue to increase. 
I will share some parts of my diary with you, but I will not repeatedly 
type out those which said how I used this character to beat this boss again 
and collected a drop of Myrrh. OK? Let's begin. At the same time, I would 
write down my own analysis of the story right after the diary.

---------------------
a. My Diary [FFCC6A]
---------------------
Page 1:
Year 1
The morning of my departure was here at last. I tried to brace myselffor 
the journey ahead.

There was a field along the main road where I decided to camp until sunrise. 
Tomorrow I set out in search of myrrh.

Explanation:
This is the first ever diary entry your character will write in the game.

Page 2:
Year 1
Not far from the village, someone called to me.

The man introduced himself as Sol Racht, leader of the caravan from 
Alfitaria. It seems that news of my caravan had already reached them. They 
showed me much kindness, and a moogle named Stiltzkin gace me a lesson 
in combat.

Explanation:
Regardless of what path you take, you will always encounter the caravan 
from Alfitaria at the first road junction.

Page 3:
Year 1
I visited a moogle nest for the first time.

The moogle there cheerfully welcomed me into his home. When it was time 
to go, I thought he looked a bit sad. I patted the bonbon on his head and 
bade him farewell.

I wonder if all moogles live so comfortably.

Explanations:
All levels or towns have a moogle house which you can enter to have your 
card stamped, play the Blazing Caravans minigame on the Gameboy Advance, 
and paint Mog.

Page 4:
Year 1
I wound my way through the vivid green hills and followed the path to reach 
the River Belle.

All my tension seemed to flow away with the River Belle's serene currents. 
As I pressed onward, I slew many goblins. I soon saw a rainbow over a great 
waterfall.

Who could have known that I would fiht the giant crab surrounded by such 
beauty!

Explanations:
River Belle Path has a lot of Goblins here, probably coming down from Goblin 
Wall. The Giant Crab is one of the toughest early bosses in the game, 
particularly in later cycles.

Page 5:
Year 1
I came across the caravan from Alfitaria today. The town was already abuzzz 
with talk of the Black Knight, but Sol had more tales to tell.

Sol spoke with such enthusiasm that he actually seemed to admire him.

It is astonishing how quickly word of the Black Knight has spread in spite 
of the way miasma isolates every town.

Explanation:
You will meet the Black Knight in one of those events in those road junctions 
some time later in the game. A couple of years later, actually.

Page 6:
Year 1
The miasma stream.

Many caravans have passed through, and now I will follow in their tracks. 
Someday, others will follow me.

I feel like I have become a small part of history.

Explanation:
Well, there is a way to bypass the miasma stream between Tipa Peninsula 
and Iron Mine Downs, and that is by Tristan's boat, which is not available 
at this time of the game.

Page 7:
Year 1
After eating, I was preparing to set off, when suddenly some Lilties ran 
by, in hot pursuit of a monster.

They were probably from Marr's Pass.

That village has long been home to blacksmiths, so they werte probably 
out gathering materials.

Explanation:
In this event, you will see a Goblin Mage holding something in his hand, 
and running past you, with the 3 caravanners from Marr's Pass in hot pursuit. 
They stop and ask you if you have seen a monster on the way. They will 
tell you how curious of the stuff that monster would have been carrying, 
and they will tell you what monster they went after last time.

Page 8:
Year 1
As I approach the Mushroom Forest, I somehow feel like I'm shrinking. Ewach 
toadstool I pass seems taller than the last.

Now I know I am inside the forest. I'm walking along a rooftop of mushrooms.

Although a malboro blocked my path, I prevailed and collected a drop of 
myrrh.

Explanation:
It seems that the Malboro is one of the other toughest earlier bosses in 
the game. Blizzaga, anyone?

Page 9:
Year 1
Marr's Pass.

This land was once the home of the Lilties. With the iron weapons they 
wrought here, they once ruled the entire world. Now, this place is but 
a small town at the crossroads.

Time washes away everthing. Joy. Agony. Everything.

Explanation: 
It seemed that Lilties once ruled the entire world, and they used weapons 
of iron, but not steel. Without iron, they cannot make anymore new weapons 
to replace the existing ones that worn down. However, Marr's Pass is still 
an important forging center, as 2 of the 3 blacksmiths of the game will 
be found here.

Page 10:
Year 1
I ran acrosss the caravan from Leuda.

Those two Selkies are some chraracters. They seemed to be enjoying the 
journey more than observing their duty. It was a refreshing outlook, but 
it worried me.

I began to understand how Sol of Alfitaria must have felt about me.

Explanation:
It is true that they will be enjoying their journey; after all, Hana Kohl 
will perform dances for random passerbys, that's you, for a sum of 100 
gil. Not worth it, eh?

Page 11:
Year 1
Today I decided to take a side road for a change of pace.

To my surprise, I heard someone call out to my caravan.

It was a group of kindly-looking Clavats. A look at their clothes told 
me that they probably hailed from the Fields of Fum.

Explanation:
The caravanners are Jake, Sheula, Lulie and Andy. They will offer free 
food to you, and they may offer to sell stuff to you as well.

Page 12:
Year 1
The Mine of Carthhriges is a relic of the Liltian reign. Orcs rule it now.

As I ventured deep into the mine, I kept jumping at my own shadow, cast 
on the walls by the flickering lamps overhead.

I found the orc king waiting for me t in the deepest caravan within. After 
my victory, I collected a drop of myrrh.

Explanation:
Donna Burke was right, The Lilties used to forge weapons out of iron to 
bring the whole world under their rule, but as the mine was exhausted, 
the Lilties gave up literally, and of course, they started to lose land.

Page 13:
Year 1
With my first journey behind me, my caravan has finally come home.

Before setting out, I had heard only stories of the world outside. Once 
out there, I found excitement, surprise, and a bit of hardship. Whenever 
I close my eyes, I vividly remember all my adcentures as I searched for 
myrrh.

Tonight is the fstival. It's time to celebrate!

Explanation:
This is your characters' conclusion for the first year. There is not much 
explaining to do, is there? But all those I remembered type of things can 
tell that your character's memories ARE important.

Page 14:
Year 2
Goblin Wall lies east of Tipa, nestled among the mountains of Kutliema.

As expected, the place was infested with goblins. They engage in dark and 
sinister ceremonies, so the people of my village fear them. I planned a 
daring raid into the goblins' lair to collect the myrrh there.

It worked. The village should be safe for now.

Explanation:
This is the Goblin HQ. I have no idea what ceremonies they hold there, 
but the bones on the ground can help suggest what happened to any innocent 
nosey parkers that enter...

Page 15:
Year 2
I came upon the caravan from Marr's Pass. It was overturned. Few monsters 
prowl the road, and I've rarely seen such things in alll my travels. The 
sight was so bizzare that I merely stared in amazement before it occurred 
to me to lend a hand. Thankfullly, no one was badly hurt. They said they 
were attacked by the infamous Black Knight. Why would he do such a thing?

Explanation: 
The Black Night seems to be deranged. He is attacking innocent travellers 
for no reason at all. I wonder if you would ever meet him?

Page 16:
Year 2
Early this morning, I passed the caravan from Alfitaria.

They proudly marched right past me! I must admit, they were an impressive 
sight.

Explanation:
The 4 caravenners from Alfitaria are actually members of the Royal Guard. 
They have very tough discipline and hence the marching.

Page 17:
Year 2
I shared a meal with the caravan from Fum.

They offered me bread and meat fresh from their farm. The bread was 
incredibly soft, and the mear was tender and delicious.

But the tough bread Mother bakes is stilll one of my favorites.

Explanation:
The caravan from the Fields of Fum will offer vegetables and fruits fresh 
from their fields and each of your characters who ate with them will get 
one of the said item for free!

Page 18:
Year 2
Today I paid a visit to Moschet Manor. I fely small in the Mushroom Forest, 
but here I'm like an ant!

I met the gigas master and his lamia wife, together with their tonberry 
chefs. I almost felt sorry for the chaos I brought into their home.

Perhaps I shold have knocked.

Explanation:
So, Jack Moschet is a Gigas, and Maggie is a Lamia. Minature versions of 
these two will be found in other stages.

Page 19:
Year 2
I was amazed to meet a traveller who did not belong to any caravan. He 
was stranded since his papaopamus was injured. I lent him some ointment 
from bnack home. In return, he showed me his compact crystal, something 
I had only heard of. Imadgine, a protable crystal! But carrying something 
like that around is just asking for a visit from a band of... No, could he 
have been...?

Explanation:
I could not remember who that person was, could be Gurdy/Hurdy, I guess. 
This proves that bandits are present in the roads.

Page 20:
Year 2
I came across the couple from Leuda.

They asked me how I was doing in a nonchalant way, but the moment they 
saw how much myrrh I had gathered, they grew downright furious.

I ddin't want trouble, so I hurried on my way.

Explanation:
My guess is that this entry is about the scene where Dah Yis and Hana Kohl 
went on an intense argument while on the road.

Page 21:
Year 2
My first visit to Alfitaria.

Huge buildings, crowded together. Lots of strange people hurrying about.

To me, they all look the same. They all wear the same hunted expression, 
as though something is chasing them down.

Explanation:
They must have been afraid of the Black Knight. That can be fixed soon.

Page 22:
Year 2
They say that the myrrh tree sprouted in Tida after the village fell to 
ruin.

The tree grew from the hopes of people witing for the caravan to return 
home. But at the same time, those hopes also gave rise to Armstrong.

Now I understand why caravans try to avoid this place.

Explanation:
Tida is deserted because its caravan failed to return in time, and as a 
result, the crystal failed, and all the inhabitants died of miasma. Their 
hopes resulted in the formation of Armstrong and the Myrrh Tree.

Page 23:
Year 2
So ends the second year of my caravan.

Miasma hindered my steps, and monsters struck at me from behind. Stilll, 
I'll always look back fondly on the warm smiles that greeted me in villagers 
I visited, and it was always a joy to meet other caravans on the long lonely 
road.

I hope I see them again next year.

Explanation:
This is your characters' conclusion of the second year.

Page 24:
Year 3
The Fields of Fum.

It is said that Clavats work tirelessly to cultivate this land. But it 
is also said that Yukes rrigated this land and that the main road was built 
by Lilties long ago. This place truly demonstrates the potential of peace.

Explanations:
To be more precised, the Yukes constructed a sluice on the southern edge 
of Lake Shella. This helped transform Jegon Creek into a river, and this 
irrigated the Fields of Fum.

Page 25:
Year 3
Today, I learned of flan.

Their gelatinous bodies have no arms or legs. They attack by coiling up 
their up their bodies and then sprining at ofes in a ferocious head butt. 
They also spit a stickty, acid substance from their gaping mouths. Though 
this acid lacks the power to melt weapons or armor, it can restrict the 
vicitm's movements.

Explanation:
My character met Amidatty at a road junction, and he offered old Yukish 
wisdom for 10 gil. Then he told the character to listen carefully, whenever 
a Flan is encountered, do the above.

Page 26:
Year 3
By the time caravans reach Daemon's Court, the long journey has made many 
weary and some arrogant.

The name of the placed is intended to be a warning to stay alert and not 
succumb to fatigue or overconfidence.

I must brace myself.

Explanation:
I only know the word "Daemon" as the name of that e-mail address of ISPs 
that reject e-mails.

Page 27
Year 3
I spotted the Striped Brigands by the main road. I recently heard that 
they'd killed a man, so I asked them for the truth.

They claimed that they never take lives.

As I talked with them, I realized they are good people at heart. I think 
I can trust them.

Explanation:
You really cannot trust Selkie thieves. They will rob you from time to 
time. It is rather unavoidable.

Page 28
Year 3
Winds have always come from Selepation Cave, beyond the couthern forests 
of the plains of Fum. But who could have known it was the cave worm's doing?

After collectying the myrrh there, I looked back from the mouth of the 
cave. No wind stirred now that the monster had drawn its last breath. 
Legends are only legends, after all. But as I turrned to leave, a gust 
of wind brushed my cheeks.

Explanation:
So, it seems that the breath of the Cave Worm alone is enough to generate 
wind. When one dies, there is another one ready to take its place.

Page 29
Year 3
I wonder why anyone would actually want to travel into miasma. Today, I 
met a stranger named Gurdy who was nearly killed by the caravan from Marr's 
Pass.

Lighting brings the cactus pain
Now it all begins again

I'm not quite sure what the verse means, but I think he recited it to me 
as thanks.

Explanation:
Gurdy is trying to help you to find the hidden element in Lynari Desert. 
From the verse, it implies that you will have to cast Thunder on a certain 
cactus in a certain desert. (Lynari Desert, do you read me?)

Page 30
Year 3
I defeated a malboro at the Mushroom Forest and finally collected a drop 
of myrrh.

I am now safely back on the road, but I could barely stand - much less 
walk - when I reached the myrrh tree.

Explanation:
This just shows how tough the Malboro will be even on the 2nd cycle! Want 
Blizzaga, anyone?

I think I will sleep now, for tomorrow is another day.

Page 31
Year 3
My third year with the caravan draws to a close.

As I made new memories this year, those from the last began to dade. In 
one fairy tale, memories that grow dim are eaten by a terrible demon. I 
wonder what happens to memories when they're completely forgotten...
I suppose looking back and cherishing the past can bring sadness when we 
face the future.

Explanation:
This fairy tale is true. Memories that grow dim are eaten by Lady Mio from 
time to time, but painful memories that are completely forgotten will be 
eaten by Raem!

Page 33
Year 4
Today we saw the caravan from Alfitaria.

Sol was shocked to hear that the Black Knight had attacked the caravan 
from Marr's Pass. Furious, he began to look into the history of the Black 
Knight

The last thing anyone had heard was that a preacher had hired him, and 
the pair had headed deep into the swamp.
Explanation: 
This preacher may be called Hurdy, and they went hunting for Raem near 
Conall Curach, but they failed and Raem took their memories away from them!

Page 34
Year 4
We heard music coming from the dirt road, where we found the couple from 
Leuda.

It was much too soon for the myrrh festival, but we stayed long enough 
to watch the girl dance and to reminisce about life back home for a while.

Truth to be told, they may have a point about taking time to enjoy the 
journey.
Explanation:
This is what happens when up agree to pay Dah Yis 100 gil to watch Hana 
Kohl dance. What a waste of money.

Page 35
Year 4
According to ancient Yukish lore, flan dislike fire, for heat can melt 
their gelatinous flesh.

For reaons unknown, they are unaffeted by spells that alter time, such 
as Slow and Stop.

The more powerful dark flan cannot be harmed until a Holy spell is cast 
upon them.
Explanation:
Flans are vulnerable to fire, but cannot be slowed or paralyzed. Dark Flans 
are only found in Conall Curach. They are purple and to be revealed by 
the Holy spell.

Ypage 37
Year 4
Gurdy again. Today he was arguing with a Lady from Fum. Why does he argue 
with caravanners when he cannot travel wihtout one?

Of crumbled inn few reminisce
Its faulty beams willl not be missed

He read the verse as if it was well known, but we had never heard of it 
before.
Explanation:
When I saw this cut scene, I could have sworn Sheula has still smiling 
while she is arguing with Gurdy! The verse on the other hand tells you 
how to find the unknown element in Lynari Desert. There is a collapsed 
tent somewhere in the north. Your character must cast Gravity on it.

Page 38
Year 4
We camped with the caravan from Fum and walked with them for a while this 
morning.

Their gentle manner reminded me of my family. When I spoke of my parent's 
profession, they gave me some advice on farming.

Perhaps I'll send some seeds back home.
Explanations:
If you send wheat seeds back home, your family will bake bannock for you. 
If you send vegatable seeds back home, your family will grow either Round 
Corns, Gourd Potatoes or Star Carrots. If you send fruit seeds, your family 
will grow either Striped Apples, Cherry Clusters or Rainbow Grapes.

Page 39
Year 4
We found the caravans from Alfitaria and from Marr's Pass shouting at each 
othther.

Though all were Lilties, it seems that city folk and countery folk don't 
get along.

Who can blame them? They've each chosen diffeerent paths in life.
Explanations:
This shows just how hot tempered are those Lilties.

Page 40
Year 4
This morning we ran into the caravan from Marr's Pass.

They are always hunting monsters, and sometimes they catch one. Today they 
shared some of their bounty with us.

I know we can't worry for every village out there, but I wonder how their 
hunt for myerrh is going.
Explanations:
This is the cut-scene where you meet that caravan, and they tell you how 
many monsters they have caught for the day and how exhausted they are. 
They are so happy that they will give you a spoil.

Page 42
Year 4
Our fourth year with the caravan is over.

So many memories from our earlier adventures have dimmed, form the joys 
of chance encounters to the suspense of our first battles. IT would be 
a pity if the goal of gathering mytrrrh became the only thing that drove 
us forward.

But we can't look back only at the past.
The quest for myrrh means hope for the future.
Explanation:
This is your characters' conclusion of Year 4. Nothing so special, is there?

Page 43
Year 5
Today we learned of behemoths.

Everyone trembles at the mention of their name, but few can say whaty makes 
them so terrifying. They simply seem to embody power.

It is said that when their massive tails swing right, infernos erupt. When 
they swing left, ice storms rage. Lightning dwells in their jeyt black 
horns. They truly are legendary creatures.
Explanation: 
Behemoths live in Conall Curach. They have a Fiery Tail Whip as well as 
an Ice Tail Whip. Their trwo horns act like the electrodes of Tasers. They 
have over 100 HP, and therefore drop valuable items like Orichalcum or 
Diamond Ore.

Page 45
Year 5
So that was the Black Knight.

Berserk is the only word that comes to mind. Swining his weapon wildly, 
he hunted something we could not see.

In a weary voice, he claimed that his memory had been stolen and that he 
is now searching for the thief.
Explanation:
The Black Knight is now searching madly for Raem, who stole his memories.

Page 46
Year 5
The Striped Brigands suddenly appeared and surrounded the caravan.

They demanded we leave behind all our valuables. Undaunted, we decided 
to charrge through their blockade.

Sorry we ran you over, little moogle, we had a feeling you'd survive.
Explanation:
There will be a cut scene in one of the years where your character will 
be surrounded by the Striped Brigands. You can choose to ram through or 
to pay up. I chose to ram through. This is what happened.

Page 48
Year 5
I can't believe it! I knew there was something suspicious about Gurdy, 
but to think he's a swindler! We saw him cheat the caravan from Shella. 
At any rate, his verse for today follows:

Lonely mushroom bursts to flame
In the land that quicksands claim

Apparently, he penned all of those himself.
Explanation:
This is another hint at getting the Unknown Element. In Lynari Desert, 
there is a rock shaped like a mushroom, you will have to cast Fire on it.

Page 50
Year 5
Five years have passed since we first set out.

There was a man who lost his memory and spent his days chasing some sort 
of light. How could anyone go on without any memory at all? Perhaps he 
hunts the light because, stripped of his memory, he has nothing left.

If he still had his memory, he would surely have schosen a different path.
Explanation:
This is your character's conclusion of the 5th year.

Page 51
Year 6
Leuts of Marr's Pass gave us some advice:

"Flan carry nothing worthy of note. Well, water flan sometimes yield some 
chilly gel, which may come in handy."
Explanation:
Water Flans are found in Veo Lu Sluice, and they carry Chilly Gel, which 
can be used to craft many ice related accessories and weapons.

Page 53
Year 6
Today we witnessed the death of the Black Knight.

A boy named Leon Esla was riding with the caravan from Alfitaria. He drove 
his spear into the knight.

The Black Knight seemed at peace when he died. I wish I knew why.
Explanation:
One of the possible reasons why the Black Knight is happy to be killed 
is that his spirit has entered Leon Esla's mind. Lady Mio will tell you 
that Raem robbed Leon of his memories, so I guess Leon must be the Black 
Knight, or has gained his spirit.

Page 54
Year 6
Today we learned of the terrible lizardman king.

He rules Daemon's Court and is said to rival dragons in power.

His weapon was used to smash fortifications in tyeh ancient wars. His sheild 
conceals crossbows that fire bolts in every direction, and they are 
sometimes infused with fire and ice magic.
Explanation: 
The Lizardman King can fire up to 5 Fire or Ice arrows at the same time.

Page 55
Year 6
Veo Lu Sluice is a monument to peace. The myrrh tree sprouted here as idf 
to celebrate the coming of such times.

It is unfortunatem however, that the tree grew near the golem, who was 
left there to protect the sluice from omonsters.

I suppose it just goes to show that nothing can be gained without toil.
Explanation:
Veo Lu Sluice is built by the Yukes in the time of peace. The Golem is 
basically the chief of security around there, and will attack any intruders, 
including people coming in to collect myrrh.

Page 56
Year 6
Was I dreaming? Or I did I really see something on Gurdy's back?

He mentioned something quite strange. He said he had a brother whom he 
had never met. What could he mean by that?

Three rocks await the winter's kiss
One by one they find their bliss
Explanation:
Due to having his memories stolen by Raem, Gurdy forgot that his real name 
was Hurdy. (Revealed by Lady Mio later) This verse is another hint. To 
find the unknown element, go and find the three boulders in Lynari Desert 
and cast Blizzard on the three. (The smallest first, the largest last.)

Page 57
Year 6
Shella, citadel of the Yukes.

There is a slight chill in the air, and I find it hard to believe that 
Tipa and Shella are part of the same world. They say that Yukes dress in 
strange ways to maximize their magical abilities. Someone once said that 
they have no bodies, only souls. Yukes are a mysterious people indeed.
Explanation:
This is another indepth look of the Yukes.

Page 58
Year 6
At dawn we met the caravan from Fum.

Every time we meet, the conversation turns to nature or farming.

Everything about them is down to earth. Hearing their stories, we can't 
help but feel that such a life is a good way to survive in this 
miasma-infested world.
Explanations:
The inhabitants of the Fields of Fum are mostly farmers, and hence are 
experts at agriculture.

Page 60
Year 6
Today was the end of our sixth year.

We later heard more about the child who slew the Black Knight. Apparently, 
his father had left before he was even born.

We wonder whether the boy simply wanted some sort of memory with his father. 
By avenging heis father's death, he would form an unbreakble link with 
a man he never had the chance to know.
Explanation:
This showed that Leon Elsa's memories may have also been stolen by Raem.

Page 61
Year 7
I ran across the caravan from Marr's Pass. They were heading home with 
their chalice full of myrrh.

They were quite generous with weapons they'd found, as some were of no 
use to them.

I suppose that great blacksmiths like them prefer their own weapons over 
those wrought by others anyway.
Explanation:
This describes the cutscene on which Aladair got the Marr Sword from the 
caravan of Marr's Pass.

Page 65
Year 7
Tonight I celebrate the end of my seventh year.

"In ages past, there was no miasma, and all the world was a paradise. A 
princess drew radiance from memories, and with them she made the crystal 
shine"

Our world used to be this paradise. How could we forget to hope for a world 
without miasma?
Explanation:
This is the main characters' conclusion of the 7th year.

Page 67
Year 8
Today I walked for a while with the caravan from Alfitaria.

The entire time, Sol spoke of nothing but his fondness for days long gone. 
I suppodse some people never change.
Explanation:
This shows that old people have a lot of rich long-term memories to share 
with the young. Like how he was a lad etc.

Page 69
Year 8
Today a voice hailed me from a distance. Amidatty of Shella beckoned me 
closer.

Pointing to a loaf of ordinary bannock, he boasted hat it was a modle of 
the whole world. I simply nodded along.

Ah, now I remember! It was the same load that Gurdy has hawking before.
Explanation:
This describes the cutscene where Amidatty attempted to show me the world 
based on a loaf of bannock, only that I chose to eat it up!

Page 70
Year 8
A band of thieves and a swindler!

Lightning brings the cactus pain
Of crumbled inn few reminisce
Lonely mushroom bursts to flame
Three rocks await the winter's kiss
In the end shall bloom a flower
Sacred light reveals its power

Maybe I can look for buried treasure there.
Explanation: 
Maybe your character can look for the unknown element in the Lynari Desert. 
To do so, cast Thunder on the large deep green cactus, cast Gravity on 
the tent, cast Fire on the mushroom shaped rock, cast Blizzard on 3 boulders, 
from smallest to largest, and finally, cast Life on a flower. The unknown 
element hot spot will be there.

Page 71
Year 8
I ran across the caravan from Alfitaria.

There was one less person among them. I was afrid a monster had gotten 
someone, but they said theat Sol had retired!

He had become a father, so he returned to the city. Speaking of family, 
I wonder how everyone back hoenm is doing...
Explanation:
Sol Racht has finally retired from his job as a caravanner of Alfitaria.

Page 73
Year 8
My eight year comes to a close.

"One day, a star fell from the heavens. Memories lost their glow, and the 
crystal grew dim. From the darkness, a great evil soon emerged."

The rest can be heard in Shella, buit this is no children's tale. The meteor 
was real as monsters and miasma.
Explanation:
A long time ago, a meteor crashed onto the world, disrupting the balance 
of the world's built in crystal. Hence, miasma swept through the land.

Page 74
Year 9
A long shadow stretched across the dirt path. It belonged to Amidatty.

He pointed to a loaf of moldy bannock and declared that the mold represents 
miasma. I was a bit weary of this by now, but I humoured him.

For all his quirks, he is a surprisingly clever man.
Explanation:
This time, I chose to listen to Amidatty.

Page 76
Year 9
According to ancient Yukish lore, griffins are quite vulnerable to fire.

They can also be frozen for a short period of time with ice spell fusion.

The spell Slow is effective against them, but Stop is not. Spells of 
lighthing and gravity are useless.
Explanation:
Griffins can be frozen with Blizzara or Blizzaga, but not Blizzard. They 
can be slowed down. As they are ground based birds, gravity does not work 
very well, and can take only 1 HP from them.

Page 77
Year 9
I heard voices up ahead, and sure enough, they belonged to the couple from 
Leuda.

They seemed truly distressed this time, so I bought what they offered and 
even paid more than what they asked.

I think that I did the right thing, but I was also amazed at how some people 
never change.
Explanation:
This describes the event where my main character bought an item off them 
at a higher price than the one offered. Actually, you get to set the price.

Page 80
Year 9
The curtain falls on my ninth year.

"The demon awoke ravenous and began to swallow the shadows. Monsters 
sprouted in their wake."

The talke is filled with many opposing elements, like the star and the 
darkness, the princess and the demon, the crystal's glow and the monsters. 
And behind them all lie memories. I think it's trying to convey something 
important.
Explanation:
Raem was awaken by the meteor, and he started to swallow memories, forming 
monsters at the same time.

Page 81
Year 10
Leuts of Marr's Pass gave me some advice:

"Orcs love armor. Oh, and because they live I the mines, they have bronze 
and iron. I don't think there's any mythril in that mine, but, who knows?"

Page 82
Year 10
I came across Amidatty and his caravan.

He knew it was nothing but bannock, but he would not let himself think 
that way. His kind are peculiar folk, but now I believe that this is how 
they seek knowledge. Maybe that loaf was merely a tool for his philosophy.

Never underestimate Amidatty!
Explanation: 
Yes, you get to see Amidatty explaining the world with a loaf of Bannock 
and yet again.

Page 83
Year 10
According to ancient Yukish lore, the only spells that have no effect on 
malboros are Stop and Slow. Any other kind inflicts damage, especially 
fused fire spells, which can set them aflame.

Amidatty reminded me that any time you face a powerful monster, the first 
spell you should try is Gravity.
Explanation:
Casting Fira on the Malboro can help weaken its defense by 25%. For all 
monsters that are not resistant to Gravity, casting Gravity on them can 
withdraw at least 10% of their total HP from them.

Page 84
Year 10
I heard music coming from the dirt road.

I knew that sound well. It was the couple of Leuda, of course.

They asked if I could stay for a song, but I was hardly in a festive mood, 
so I hurried on toward my next destination.
Explanation:
This time, I chose not to pay 100 gil to watch Hana Kohl dance.

Page 88
Year 10
My tenth year with the caravan is over.

"Once monsters had blackened our memories, the demon devoured them. From 
the darkness, monsters spawned anew."

How did the rest of the story go? There was seomthing about a princess, 
but I can't remember how it ends.
Explanation:
As I said, Raem led to a bad cycle. He eats more sad memories, and more 
monsters come out, and et cetera.

Year 11
Accordig to acncient Yukish lore, electric jellyfish fill their hollow 
bodies with a gas that is lighter than the currounding air and use 
electricity generated from theat gas to adjust their body temperature. 
This allows them to fly. Through this process, they move with great agility 
as they attack with their tentacles.

Their anatomy renders them vulnerable to magic but immune to lightning 
spells.
Explanation:
And furthermore, do not hit them with direct physical attacks, or your 
character will get shocked.

Year 11
Todaay I visited Conall Curach. As I marched over those endless planks, 
I began to understand how the Selkies must have felt.

The dragon zombie awaited me at the end. Long ago, Selkies must have fought 
this creature in their search for a new home.

The myrrh tree drooped mournfully, as if it marked where the Selkies' dreams 
were buried.
Explanation:
I guess that the Selkies must have defeated a dragon at this swamp, it 
is dead, and now undead. It has come back to life as the Dragon Zombie! 
Selkies came to the swamp as they are looking for a new home after having 
been driven home from their homeland. Obviously, they are not good at 
building a Venice there, and hence many of them died while trying to 
survive.

Page 92
Year 11
I heard voices from afar and was dismayed to find that they belonged to 
the couple from Leuda.

They seemed truly distressed this time. I bought some things from them 
only after haggling their prices down, just to spite them. Still, I hope 
they are all right.

Explanation: 
This is what happens when you buy an item from Dah Yis at a lower price 
than they have offered to you! Pretty mean, isn't it?

Year 11
Another year with the caravan draws to a close.

At every month festival, my elder tells the tale of my caravan's first 
departure. Even I can't remember everything without peeking at my diary. 
But both the joy of seeing the caravan off and the sorrow of having to 
send me back into peril are emotions he cannot forget.
Explanation:
From Year 12 onwards, your characters will not make any conclusions about 
their year.

Page 96
Year 12
Today I learned of the terrible golem.

Though its creator passed away long ago, it can still be seen watching 
over the Veo Lu Sluice. Although it has weakened power the years, it can 
still blast powerful beams of light. Its red laser incinerates everything 
within range around the golem, while its blue laser chills its target 
instantly.
Explanation:
The red laser moves in a radial path around the Golem, while the blue laser 
moves in a pair of zig zag paths, overlapping each other on the ground.

Page 100
Year 133
According to ancient Yukish lore, many mysteries surround the tonberries.

They are vulnerable to most spells, but highly resistant to some. Spell 
fusion can afflict them with enchanted effects.

They have little featr of gravity magic, and slow and Stop are useless.
Explanation: 
Amidatty are referring to both the Tonberry Chefs and the Tonberries. As 
Tonberries can cast Slow, time changing attacks have no effect on them.


Page 102
Year 13
According to ancient Yukish lore, lamias share many traits with snakes, 
including an aversion to cold. Fire spells can also hurt them, but their 
scales protect them from catching fire. Since their lower bodies are always 
in contact with the ground, lightning does them no harm unless spell fusion 
is used.
Explanation:
And I thought Lamias are crosses between slugs and humans. Maybe I am wrong. 
After all, Maggie of the Moschet Manor has a human face and upper body.

Page 104
Year 14
I sailed to the island of Kilanda and landed safely, much to my relief.

Mount Kilanda fumed angrily in the distance. I hurried onward.

At the summit waited the iron giant, who gave me a fair amount of trouble. 
All is well, though, and I am back on the coast.
Explanation:
Kilanda Island is a hot spot! The Iron Giant on the other hand, looked 
like the Iron Giant from outer space from the movie, Iron Giant.

Page 105
Year 14
I was surprised to find the caravan from Fum ravelling near the main road.

They rarely come out this far, but today they were there selling their 
surplus items.

I decided to buy something. It wasn't anything I needed, but I figured 
it might come in handy someday.
Explanation:
Yes, sometimes, the caravanners from the Fields of Fum will offer to sell 
you random items. You can buy as many as you wish. This is what your character 
will write if he/she decides to buy something.

Page 109
Year 15
I came across the caravan from Marr's Pass.

Though stout warriors, even Lilties suffer a poor hunt now and then. So 
it went this time, as they had been unable to find all the materials 
requested by their village.

They seemed dispirited, and I had just what they needed, so I gave it to 
them. It was a good feeling.
Explanation: 
The Lilties will ask if you had a spare item, this is what you will write 
if you say yes.

Page 110
Year 15
I came across the caravan from Marr's Pass.

Though stout warriors, even Lilties suffer a poor hunt now and then. SO 
it went this time, as they had been unable to find all the materials 
requested by their village.

I had what they needed, but I still needed it myself. In the end, I had 
no choice buy to refuse them.
Explanation:
I did not know that I had that item, so I promptly refused, only to find 
that I really had!

Page 111
Year 15
AS I was riding along, I heard something hit the road behind us.

I stepped out to take a look, and there again were the Striped Brigands.

They looked like they wanted to say something, but they turned and ran 
off, wailing like children. Although they got me again, I felt a strange 
sense of victory.
Explanation: 
The Striped Brigands stole a Striped Apple from me in this scene, the leader 
tried to chant out their motto, but forgot! Then he just ran away shouting 
"nyah, nyah!"

Page 113
Year 15
Today I learned of mimics.

These monsters disguise themselves as treasure chests and attack anyone 
who approaches. They also excel at magic.

They are masters of fire, lightning and ice spells. Once they ast Stop 
on an enemy, they attack by opening their lids wide and smashing them down.
Explanation: 
Don't worry, Mimics are only found in Rebena Te Ra. Therefore, you should 
always open treasure chest by pressing A there, to be safe.

Page 115
Year 16
I found the caravn from Fum ravelling near the main road, and they treid 
to push their goods on me.

Sheula claimed that they had too much to carry home, but I could tell from 
the gleam in Jake's eyes that they were just after my money. I never 
suspected Clavats could be so sly. I bought nothing from them, of courser.

Page 117
Year 16
Today I learned of garpoyles.

They are found mostly at moschet Manor, where they keep watch for intruders.

They look like status at first glance, but once they spot an adversary, 
they swoop in and attack with stone claws and magic.
Explanation:
Gargoyles also appear in Rebena Te Ra.

Page 118
Year 16
According to ancient Yukish lore, sahagins have no remarkable weakenesses. 
Both sahagins and their cousins the sand sahagins can be harmed with magic. 
Stone sahagins however, are armoured with thick scales that nullify all 
magic except that of gravity. When facing them, strike with weapons.
Explanation:
Sand Sahagins are only found in Lynari Desert, while Stone Sahagins are 
found in Conall Curach. When facing Stone Scorpions, use Gravity to half 
their HP, and then start to bash!

Page 135
Year 20
Meh Gaj of the Striped Brigands passed away.

He died courageously, sacricicing himself to save Bal Dat from a monster.

I invited the other two to come back home with us, but Bal wanted to head 
on. He said he would carry Meh Gaj's memory with him and continue the journey 
they started together. He was determined to make the old man proud.
Explanation:
This is the cut scene where Bal Dat's grandfather fell to a monster, and 
Bal Dat decided to move on in the journey with Artemcion.

Page 138
Year 21
Leuts of Marr's Pass gave me some advice:

"Sahagins? Hmmm... They're not worth hunting if it's treasure you're after."
Explanation:
Sahagins do not carry any spoils in particular.

Page 141
Year 22
Today I learned of the terrible Armstrong.

This monster inherited its name from a family that once lived in Tida.

The village's people died waiting for their cravan's return, but their 
grief lingered behind. When at last the caravan came, its members were 
warmly greeted into their former home and never left it alive.
Explanation: 
Even if one of the caravanners could leave in an attempt to destroy the 
miasma, all the other members could just have returned leaving him behind, 
preventing the downfall of Tida!

Page 143
Year 22
Leuts of Marr's Pass gave me some advice:

"Oh, how I hate carrion worms. But there's one thing you can't you can't 
find on any other creature: The prickly worm antenna. I must have Lyne 
nab one for me."
Explanation:
Worm Antennas can be found on Carrion Worms.

Page 147
Year 23
According to ancient Yukish lore, the cursed staves of the goblin kings 
render them hihghly resistant to magic, much like the maces of the orc 
kings.

Because of this, fire, ice and lightining magic inflict no enchanted 
effects. The staff also protects them form Slow and Stop.
Explanations:
The Goblin King is resistant to magic, but who care? After all, all you 
have to do is to bash him and he will be defeated in no time.

Page 151
Year 24
I was robbed by the Striped Brigands!

I had no idea it had happened, but when supper time came round, one of 
my favorites was missing!

Well, I'm lucky that was all they took.
Explanations:
The Striped Brigands must have stolen one of your character's favorite 
food in a cut-scene on the road.

Page 158
Year 26
I was robbed by the striped brigands.

They're undoubtedly good at what they do. They took everything I had of 
value.

Someday I will return the favor.
Explanation:
They must have stolen a chunk of silver from the character here.

Page 160
Year 26
Today I learned of ghosts.

Since they are comprised of pure evil, they have no bodies to call their 
own. Even so, their very touch can inflict pain akin to a physical blow.

They gather evil to retain their form. When this occurs, the currounding 
air grows chill and affcets foes like an ice spell.
Explanation: 
This describe the Ghosts. So, their "one and a two and a ice wave" attack 
is performed whenever they gather evil.

Page 164
Year 27
According to ancient Yukish lore, the gigas lord was once immune to cold 
but has lost that resistance after residing in his manor for so long.

However, he has grown more resistant to fire and suffers no enchanted 
effects from fire magic.
Explanation: 
Jack Moschet is now vulenrable to cold, but is resistant to fire. Now you 
know.

Page 169
Year 29
I heard the story of the sphere, which is found only in the ancient writings 
of the Yukes.

This globular entity floats through the air. When it focuses its magical 
powers, it transforms its outer surfact into a mirror. Any who see their 
own reflection in it meet death.
Explanation:
This describes the Spheres of Mount Vellenge, but I have never been killed 
by one of them.

Page 173
Year 30
As I travelled a long, straight path, I spotted a couple in heated debate 
up ahead.

It was none other than the caravan from Leuda. Although they seemed 
genuinely distressed, I stelled myself and rode on by.

Caravnners cannot survive by depending on other's kindness, after all.
Explanation:
This is the cutscene where you saw two caravans in Leuda arguing with each 
other that so many text boxes filled the screen.

Year 30
As I rode along the stone path, someone called out to me. It was the caravan 
from Shella.

They seemed to know exactly what I carried. I was so spooked by their uncanny 
intuition that I lied to them, saying I had no such thing.

I still feel a twinge of remorse for doing that.
Explanation:
This shows that whenever Amidatty asks if you have any item, you must have 
it. Even if you thought you had not.

Page 179
Year 31
According to ancient Yukish lore, mu are native to River Belle Path. It 
is said they have always lived near water, at least as farr back as anyone 
can remember. New strains of the species have appeared with each new 
habitat.

They all have a fair tolerance for electricity. Furthermore, lava mu 
dislike cold, while snow mu generally avoiud fire.
Explanation:
All Mus are resistant to electricity.

---------------------------
b. Story Analysis [FFCC6B]
---------------------------
Well, from all the cut-scenes and talks with a Carbuncle in Mag Mell, the 
hidden story of Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles can be revealed. It seems 
that there is no spoonfeeding in this game. In order to truly understand 
the story, you must play the game through a couple of years (Game time, 
of course, not real time). This is the real story.

Long ago, the world is protected by a giant crystal. One day, a giant meteor 
fell onto the earth and shattered the crystal. Therefore, the crystal can 
no longer protect the world anymore, therefore miasma swept across the 
world and anyone who comes in contact with miasma would suffer from a slow 
and painful death. On the other hand, large shards of the crystal were 
scattered all around the world. People found out that they will be protected 
as long as they stay near the crystals and hence towns were built near 
the crystals.

The crystals use to be kept going by memories that people forget from time 
to time. But since the meteor fell, memories could no longer be supplied 
to the crystals, because Raem ate them all. Hence, people will now have 
to send out Crystal Caravans to fight the monsters that were sprouted from 
the terrible memories of the people around the world to get the myrrh from 
Myrrh Trees. In fact, in ancient language, myrrh means life, and hence 
the Crystal Caravans are there to seek the water of life.

Of course, there had been some attempts from people to find the roots of 
the miasma and to get rid of it. In fact, Raem had a device known as the 
Meteor Parasite to spread miasma all around the world. 

There was a village named Tida whose caravan was supposed to return in 
3 days, and yet failed to return. Therefore, the people stayed, the crystal 
no longer functions and every resident of Tida were killed by the miasma. 
This is because a certain caravanner had gone out in an attempt to rid 
the world of miasma.

At the same time, there was once a preacher who hired the Black Knight 
to go into Mount Vellenge to destroy the Meteor Parasite. However, they 
failed, and their memories were robbed from them by Raem. That preacher 
was Hurdy. This is why the Black Knight became rather mad, running berzerk 
around the place searching for a light before he was killed by a boy named 
Leon Esla, who never met his father. Leon Esla kept the Black Knight's 
armor as a victory gift, but when his mother saw the armor, she wept. This 
shows that the Black Knight is actually Leon's father, and that he has 
lost memory of his father, resulting in him killing him. Hurdy at the same 
time thought that he was a new person called Gurdy, and that Hurdy was 
a brother that he had never met. He was a fraud, and yet he gives your 
character a hint at finding the unknown element required to get into the 
Abyss and to find Raem. Therefore, Hurdy must be the caravanner who let 
his village down.

With such events being witnessed and heard by your character, he/she will 
be provided with a new mission in life. His/her mission would be to find 
the unknown element, travel into Mount Vellenge, kill the Meteor Parasite 
and defeat Raem to return the world to its natural order.

------------------------------------------------------
7. Random Musings and other Interesting Stuff [FFCC7]
------------------------------------------------------
I have been playing with this game for some time now, and I just happened 
to find out some interesting things about the game to share with you, which 
you may already know. Here are some. 

VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:
Please note that you may jusy say, "It's a game, get over it." But still, 
some things are just too illogical even for the illogical fantasy world 
of this game! Hence it's worth saying out anyway. Just have some imagination 
when you read part a. Don't go running to me and saying that it's not funny, 
as I cannot be blamed for having an eccentric sense of humor. Besides, 
I am not saying that there should be a "breath in, and out" button to press 
so the game can be ultra realistic. As we Chinese say, "Getting too much 
of a good thing can be bad!"

------------------------
a. Funny Stuff [FFCC7A]
------------------------
Firstly, it's about the character models. There seems to be only one 
character model for young Clavat girls, like those little sisters of Clavat 
caravanners, and they all wearing that kind of headwear. Why would they 
want to hide their hair from sight? Besides, it seems that if you hang 
around for long enough, you will notice the girl sucking her thumb as if 
she is a kindergartener. Once, I found a girl named Sophia in Marr's Pass 
(The daughter of Arneaux), and she brags about how she does the cooking 
and washing up all by herself. If she is so mature, why is she still sucking 
her thumb like a little baby!?

On the other hand, character models for young Yukish girls seem to be absent 
all around the place. I have this Yuke caravanner, and she had a little 
brother. When I visited Shella, there are two other young Yukish boys, 
all bearing the same character model, and there is not a single young Yukish 
girl in sight! Man, if this is so, how can Yukes reproduce if they had 
no females?!

Now, onto the Lilties. I am just amazed how these tiny little people can 
fight so well. However, I have noticed that the designers of the game seemed 
to protray their hot-tempered personalities a bit too much! Whenever I 
talked to any Lilty, none of them smiled. They can only frown! This really 
is a big problem. After all, people who live sad lives usually can get 
ill much more easily!

As I said in the guide of Leuda, all the Selkies there are pickpockets. 
As long as your character is not another Selkie or has more than 100 gil, 
they can steal 1-10 gil from you. I really am amazed how they can do that 
without sticking their hands into your pockets. It's also amazing that 
several of them are quite kind to you! There's a contradiction here.

Another funny thing is that, there is this yearly timer, right? Whenever 
you collect 3 drops of myrrh, one year will pass. However, as you may notice, 
all characters in this game never age. I have played through over 60 years, 
and yet the characters' little brothers and sisters are still mindlessly 
sucking their thumbs! Another inconsistency in this game.

I also found the briefing of River Belle Path a little contradictory. If 
no one has ever seen the monsters there because they are all eaten, then 
how could crystal caravans still enter, kill monsters and collect myrrh? 
There MUST be some people who have at least seen one Goblin in their travels.

Furthermore, if you note closely, the boss of Mushroom Forest is called 
the Malboro. Put an r between the a and l and it becomes, Marlboro, the 
name of a cigarette company. So, has Square-Enix been sponsored from behind 
the scenes from that company? But still, the Malboro has a truly poisonous 
breath that he will give out from time to time. I wonder if it has nicotine 
and tar in it? Someone ought to put a government health warning sign outside 
the boss's arena.

As you may know, the Lilties unstoppable conquest slowed to a halt after 
all the iron of the Mine of Carthuiges has been mined out. I know that 
weapons will wear out, but why wouldn't someone melt and recast the weapons 
into newer weapons and armor, and why wouldn't they hunt other monsters 
and steal their Mythril or Orichalcum and use it for even more powerful 
weapons? Obviously those Lilties were more brawn than brain at that time.

You will notice that there is a single crystal protecting the Jegon River 
area, but who are the crystal caravanners of the river? Tristan seems 
unlikely. There was no mention of any caravan of that area.

People from the Fields of Fum just look too much alike! All the women look 
like Sheula with pink clothes, while all the men look like Jake wearing 
brown costumes. Come on, Square-Enix, can you be more creative around here?

In Daemon's Court, there is this bridge guarded by a Fire Bomb, and if 
you kill it, the bridge will be blown away, and will drift to Conall Curach. 
However, this is just not possible. There aren't any river outlets in 
Daemon's Court, that waterway seems to be a sort of moat, and there are 
no rivers running west, so how on earth could those logs drift there?

Now, as for Tida. Yes, it's an opposite clone of Tipa with a great contrast. 
There is one thing though, if only one boy caravaner named Hurdy went out 
with the Black Knight to try and eliminate all the miasma, then how could 
the caravan never return? There had got to be other members of the caravan 
that kept it going, and hence the tragedy in Tida should not have occurred!

Besides, why would Crystal Caravanners break into other people's private 
houses just to get myrrh, and why would myrrh grow inside a manor? It seems 
that there is no way you can fight the boss without killing all the Tonberry 
Chefs. If this is so, why don't crystal caravanners knock politely on the 
door, and talk to the master, "Oh, Mr. Moschet, would you mind letting 
us in to collecting myrrh from the tree?" I am sure that will do, 
particularly Jack Moschet will be happy as long there is dinner. Even if 
he refuses, there has got to be some easily accessible passages to reach 
the myrrh tree!

Has the Golem been slacking over the years? He is deisgned to protect Veo 
Lu Sluice from monsters, and yet when you enter, the whole place is full 
to the brim with Lizardmen and Gigan Toads. It seems that someone has not 
been responsible over the years, and he must have taken bribes from the 
monsters or something, as he will even attack crystal caravanners who 
venture near the myrrh tree, with Water Flans by his side! Better report 
to the Independent Comission Against Corruption. (An independent 
organization in Hong Kong set up in the 1970s to crack down on corruption.)

I am also surprised that there really is one and only one tailor in the 
whole wide world in this game, and he is in Shella. Again, this is quite 
ridiculous, as there has ought to be multiple tradesmen in such a large 
world. Just imagine if it is like that in the REAL WORLD. Then I guess 
Spiran would be liable to an anti-trust charge...

Finally in Conall Curach, if Selkies had to build a new home in the swamp, 
why wouldn't they just stick with a Venice style architecture, with poles 
sticking in the water? Then, they can slowly expand and cover the entire 
swamp, and they can set up a village similar to that of Shella.

I noticed that for some strange reason, Meteor Attacks can be launched 
by the Dreamcatcher even when your Selkie is indoors. I wonder where did 
the meteor came from. Why aren't there any holes in the ceiling? I guess 
the developers are too lazy to cover the ceiling with their auto adjusted 
camera angles.

There is this artifact called a Teddy Bear, however, it does not even look 
like one. What's the point of naming a greenish coloured piece of junk 
on a stick and calling it a teddy bear if it does not resemble a bear in 
any way! Liars, truly liars.

Submitter's Observation! Brian Johnson's Observation
Something for section 7 in the funny stuff.  The Legendary Weapon scroll, 
as you know, makes one of Excalibur, Gungnir, Mystic Hammer, Queen's Heel.  
I don't know what a Queen's Heel is, if anything, but Excalibur is the 
name of King Arthur's sword from Celtic mythology, Gungnir is the name 
of Odin's spear from Norse mythology, and the Yukes get a generic name.  
What is funny is that Mjollnir, which is an artifact, is the name of Thor's 
hammer, from Norse mythology, which is undoubtably a "legendary hammer".  
Why would you use a generic name instead?

Submitter's Observation! Swishy's Observation
By the way, some of the monsters, like the griffin, are based off of "real" 
mythological creatures, right? I noted you made mention of reference to 
some of the weapons being named after stories, but not any of the monsters.  
For instance, the griffin was supposed to be a creature that was half eagle, 
half lion. Or, were you just saving yourself some extra typeage?  (I don't 
blame you for this, I could never see me finishing a walkthrough like that.)

Another note of reference: a Selkie in the game said that "Selkies came 
from the sea, and to the sea they shall return" (I can't remember the name, 
it was a Selkie in Leuda looking over the cliff).  I was wondering to myself:  
is this any reference to the selkies of folklore?  In mythology, selkies 
are suppose to be beings that can turn in to seals and into humans.  I 
wonder if the game writers were making reference to this. If they were, 
could it have anything to do with the fate of De Nam?

A pondering question also about De Nam: If monsters were spawned from 
bad/faded memories, then why did De Nam turn into a monster if he's not 
a memory?  Maybe he got eaten, and then the stupid monster picked up his 
hankercheif, just like how other monsters pick up random things (like 
artifacts like "Teddy Bear") Or, maybe the memory of drinking that awful 
miasma water turned him into a monster...

A question from my sister: Why is there no such items as "Goblin 
Suspenders?" (Don't try to answer that one...)

In the final battle with Raem (Memiroa), you get to see your own memories 
in bubbles. But surely your character could remember out stuff other than 
his/her family. So why wouldn't images of towns and other places flash 
back inside those bubbles?

---------------------------------------
b. Minigame: Blazing Caravans [FFCC7B]
---------------------------------------
If you happen to find a set of matching mog stamps in a moogle house, then 
you can get to play a minigame called Blazing Caravans. However, this game 
can only be played in multiplayer mode, and there is a good reason too. 
This is because, to avoid having a split screen mode, each racer should 
have their own independent screen, coming in form of the screen of their 
Gameboy Advance. 

To play the Blazing Caravan's Minigame, enter a moogle house, and talk 
to the resident moogle. Tell him you want to play the minigame. Then, the 
Gameboy Advances will reboot, and the game will be loaded.

You will be given the instructions for the game. The button configuration 
is similar to all those GBA racing games you will find out there. The A 
button is used to accelerate, the B button is used to brake. The control 
stick acts as a steering wheel. As for the R button, you can use it to 
fire magicite on your other opponents.

For each track you will be given the choice of 4 types of caravan. Each 
caravan differs from each other in terms of top speed, acceleration and 
handling. I don't think that any further explanation is required for those 
3 properties. Although I would prefer the ones with the best handling.

On the race track, you will be able to pick up three types of Magicite. 
Fire, Thunder and Blizzard. Press L to launch them upon your opponents. 
Fire will set an opponent on fire and slow them down. Thunder will paralyze 
the opponent and weaken his handling, thus causing them to spin out of 
control. Using Blizzard will drop some ice onto the ground behind your 
caravan, causing any unfortunate caravan behind to slip.

Another feature is the food. Depending on your character's food preferences, 
riding into food may either provide a speed boost or slow your caravan 
down. Therefore, to ensure that you will get a speed boost, have your 
character like all 8 foods in the game.

There really is not a special reward for winning, it's just that your 
fastest times will be recorded down so that you will feel a little proud 
of yourself. That's it.

-----------------------------------
c. Special Playing Styles [FFCC7C]
-----------------------------------
Many people will complain that the game is far too easy, and repetitive, 
due to the constant slashing and replaying of the same levels to raise 
their stats. However, this really is the player's own fault that he/she 
is dissatisfied of the game. After all, if you beef someone up to the max, 
he/she will be invincibly strong, and hence all enemies will fall like 
toys, making the game super easy! So, what can you do to make the game 
more colorful and interesting? Here are some ways.

Brute Force Game:
Your character is only allowed to move in and attack the enemies at close 
quarters, and then he/she is not allowed to use ranged attacks like certain 
Focus Attacks and magic to help. No particular strategy is required, just 
bash on! This is particularly hard if you have to fight against flying 
or invisible enemies with very high HP, like Zus and Nightmares.

Magic Game:
Your character is only allowed to defeat enemies by casting spells at them, 
and he/she is not allowed to use any physical attacks. For super challenge, 
play in levels where there are enemies made of stone.

Upgradeless Game: 
Well, you create a new character, but you do not raise him/her at all. 
Then you just push him/her to the deep end at once and into a level in 
its 3rd Cycle. Now, as the enemies are very very tough, you MUST utilize 
the hit-and-run strategy to the fullest, then you can have a lovely long 
battle of attrition with the foes, where underhanded tactics work best. 
If you have the courage, beat the game with that character!

Hunting Competition:
This game requires 2 or more players. You are to be sent in to any level, 
preferably those with very tough enemies, and they are to use whatever 
means necessary to bring them down. The player who killed the most of the 
given enemy wins. Potential targets include the Behemoth, the Abbadon and 
the Zus. Happy hunting!

Follow the Leader:
This game requires 2 to 4 Game Boy Advances but only 1 player. This can 
allow several characters to be raised and/or improve their relationships 
with their families. Here's how you do it, you have a super strong character 
at player 1, while you just randomly select character for players 2 to 
4. Then, you enter a level. As soon as all command lists are prepared, 
press select on the GBAs of players 2 to 4. They will follow you around 
like drones, and hence you can play as 4 people at once with one person 
present. In fact, this is how I raised my newer characters. This method 
will prove to be a bit more challanging as the enemies will be tougher 
in multiplayer, and you cannot fuse spells by yourself.

Fuse Only:
This game also requires 2 or more players for maximum enjoyment. You are 
to play a multiplayer game, and are only allowed to defeat enemies using 
spell fusion. Now, I know that many people really will find it difficult 
to time the targeting rings exactly right, and hence it would be a challenge, 
particularly if Holy must be cast.

Point or Shame:
This type of game requires 2, or maybe 3 to 4 people for the maximum enjoyment. 
You will be playing, as the title suggests for points. Each player will 
have to try his/her best to fulfil his/her criterion for the level. The 
person who gets the most points in the end wins, and the person with the 
fewest will be considered the loser, and he/she will be asked to do some 
embarrassing thing, like singing to the crowd, or eat wasabi filled 
ice-cream, and so on...

8. Conclusion [FFCC8]
----------------------
After some hard work, the basic strategy guide of Final Fantasy: Crystal 
Chronicles has been covered. Final Fantasy has never been my favorite game 
due to it being a turned based RPG, but after I had found out this Nintendo 
exclusive is a new unique RPG that features similar gameplay mechanics 
as the Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, I do not feel sorry of spending 
HK$380 (HK$7.8 = US$1) to buy this game. This is so fun that I have played 
for over 100 hours on this game, let it be single of multiplayer. Let's 
hope Square-Enix makes more games on the Nintendo Gamecube.

This guide is to be published in Gamefaqs and ONLY Gamefaqs only. No, do 
not try to ask for permission as I will just ignore them. Of course, this 
guide is copyright 2004 to Alasdair Lo.

--------------------------------------
Appendix I: Feedback Information [A1]
--------------------------------------
Since the publishing of the original version of this guide, I decided that 
I must make some new rules for those people who want to give me a feedback 
about my guides. All future strategy guides will have this section. If 
the following rules are not observed, I will just consider your e-mail 
to be spam mail or flame mail, and I will delete it without reading it, 
and will blacklist your e-mail address.

For publishing permission:
This guide is intended to be published in GameFAQs and only GameFAQs. You 
can print it out to read it while your computer is off, but do not copy 
my work and claim it as your own. That is all. Although I do not have a 
lawyer to sue anyone if they do it without my permission, I expect everyone 
to have self discipline about these things.

Feedback Concerning Mistakes: (THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART, LISTEN 
UP)
As I am a human, and we are all humans, we all make mistakes. Nobody is 
perfect. If I had made any mistakes in my guide, feel free to e-mail me. 
But however, you must follow these rules. I have typed out some bad examples 
with each rule, and they are from some of the e-mail I received by people 
who are dissatisfied by my original Command and Conquer: Generals side 
comparison guide. 

You must:
Be polite, as I will take these feedback letters as seriously as formal 
letters, and you should specify the version number of my guide, then I 
can check my guide out. However, it need not be as formal as business letters, 
after all it is only a game. You should also present yourself clearly, 
I won't even think about anything that I cannot understand at the first 
glance, as I am a busy person.

For example, "I enjoyed reading your guide, but disagreed with you on some 
points." From a person called Alex Shikh or "I agree with you that China 
is the strongest factions, but it is not much stronger than the other 2." 
From Ives Gobau And so on.

You must not:
Say any foul language and offend me. 

For example, "Your guide was ********, full of lies and biased opinions." 
From K Truin. You are not going to make me listen by saying rude words 
to me, you will only give me the impression that you are either uneducated 
or have low EQ.

Conduct any surveys about how good my guide is and give it to me, as I 
could not care less about your so-called surveys. 

For example, "I have conducted a survey about your guide and over 90% said 
that it was a trashy tabloid." From Frozak.

Finally, you must not say anything I consider to be racist. 

For example, "You mentioned that you live in China that is obvious, 
considering your bias towards this side, etc..." "I am afraid that your 
living in China has blinded your judgment so much." From someone I could 
not remember his name. So, what are you trying to say, say that us Chinese 
are all idiots? Besides, the word bias is used to describe unfair 
comparisons due to neglecting some facts. As I have put all facts into 
account, I really cannot have made any bias towards any sides.

From all the 50 or so letters complaint I received, I decided to listen 
to less than 5 of them. Why? As only 5 of them could follow the rules stated 
above. So, you MUST take those points into consideration, or else, don't 
expect me to listen to you.

Submitting your own tips:
I am always ready to submit tips from readers. However, you should make 
sure that the tip has not been posted in my guide before you mail me. Also, 
write down your name or a pseudonym so I may credit you.

Game Help:
If you have read my guide and did not understand something, feel free to 
ask, but please do not do this too often, as my e-mail account has other 
uses. But do not ask about anything that was clearly written in my guide 
or I will not reply.

You may have wondered why I put this section up. This is a new 
"Anti-disturbance" ordinance I set up for my own use, in order to minimize 
all those annoying and insulting things I receive. In fact, during 
September alone, I received at least a hundred of mail concerning my Side 
Comparison Guide, and I am now to make sure this will never ever happen 
again.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Yours,
Lo Kai Yan Alasdair, kylohk. (Kai Yan Lo From Hong Kong)

Appendix II. Game Encyclopedia [A2]
------------------------------------
This is the Encyclopedia section of my guide, which lists out all the 
information about the items, enemies and so on of the game all in one piece, 
which makes it easier for you to find what you want instead of having to 
search inside the walkthroughs of towns and levels.

a. Weapons and Armor [A2A]
---------------------------
*****WEAPONS*****
Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles is an action RPG, and a good action RPG 
has a large variety of weapons. This ensures variety, and hence a high 
level of Customizability. All weapons call be forged by someone named Nat 
Dennim who lives in Marr's Pass.

Design: Novice's Weapon
Forged by: Nat Dennim
Weapon: Iron Sword (Clavat), Partisan (Lilty), Wave Hammer (Yuke), Solid 
Racket (Selkie)
Materials: Iron x1, 100 gil
Strength: 20

Design: Warrior's Weapon
Forged by: Nat Dennim
Weapon: Steel Blade (Clavat), Sonic Lance (Lilty), Rune Hammer (Yuke), 
Dual Shooter (Selkie)
Materials: Iron x1, Alloy x1, 300 gil
Strength: 25
All Warrior's weapons give your character 25 strength. The Clavats can 
bash the enemy, where he lunges in and digs in two hits on the poor enemy. 
The Lilties can simply charge forward, and skewer anything that gets in 
their charge. The Yukes will lunge forward and perform a shockwave on the 
enemy. The Selkie's focus attack is definitely the best, as the user will 
fire two energy blasts at the enemies, hence it is called the dual blast.

Then, you should upgrade to the Master's Weapon.

Design: Master's Weapon
Forged by: Nat Dennim
Weapon: Rune Blade (Clavat), Dragon Lance (Lilty), Mythril Hammer (Yuke), 
Butterfly Head (Selkie)
Materials: Mythril x1, Alloy x1, 700 gil
Strength: 30
The Clavats this time have a ballistic focus attack called the Soulshot, 
where they can fire a tiny ball of energy at the enemy. The Lilties get 
the Pulse Thrust, it's just another of those charging attacks. The Yukes 
get the shock bomb again, and the Selkies get the Power Kick, where they 
will jump out and kick the enemy.

Design: Victorious Weapon
Forged by: Nat Dennim
Weapon: Defender (Clavat), Highwind (Lilty), Prism Hammer (Yuke), Prism 
Bludgeon (Selkie)
Materials: Iron x2, Ogre Fang x1, 500 gil
Strength: 31

Design: Valiant Weapon
Forged by: Nat Dennim
Weapon: Feather Saber (Clavat), Titan Lance (Lilty), Goblin Hammer (Yuke), 
Elemental Cudgel (Selkie)
Materials: Bronze x3, Cerberus Fang x1, 500 gil
Strength: 31

Design: Mighty Weapon
Forged by: Nat Dennim
Weapon: Bastard Sword (Clavat), Halberd (Lilty), Sonic Hammer (Yuke), 
Steel Cudgel (Selkie)
Materials: Iron x2, Jagged Scythe x1, 500 gil
Strength: 32

Design: Greatest Weapon
Forged by: Nat Dennim
Weapon: Ultima Sword (Clavat), Ultima Lance (Lilty), Ultima Hammer (Yuke), 
Ultima Maul (Selkie)
Materials: Ultimite x1, Orichalcum x1
Strength: 35

Design: Legendary Weapon
Forged by: Nat Dennim
Weapon: Excalibur (Clavat), Gungnir (Lilty), Goblin Hammer (Yuke), 
Queen's Heel (Selkie)
Materials: Orichalcum x1, Alloy x1, Ancient Potion x1, 2500 gil
Strength: 33 for Excalibur and Queen's Heel, 35 for Gungnir and Goblin 
Hammer
The Legendary Weapon can be found in the item selection screen after you 
beat a boss. The Same goes for Orichalcum and Ancient Potion. This is the 
only way to get those items if you do not want to go to Lynari Desert, 
Conall Curach and other difficult levels. Once you have it, you already 
would have the most powerful or the second most powerful weapon, in terms 
of strength of your tribe. The Clavats have the Soulshot as the Focus Attack, 
and they can fire a very large energy ball at the enemy. The Lilties have 
the Cross Slash, and they will charge into the enemy and hit them twice. 
The Yukes have the Magic Bomb, which is another shock wave, and the Selkies 
get the Power Kick again. Once you have it, you don't need to worry about 
the Greatest Weapon, as there is nothing so great about the Greatest Weapon, 
except it is expensive. After all, all Greatest Weapons have a Strength 
of only 33 or 35.

Clavats, Lilties and the Selkies on the other hand, can do even better 
than the Legendary Weapon. The Lilties have the Celestial Weapon, and the 
Selkies have the Lunar Weapon. Clavats have the Dark Weapon. They are really 
powerful. Both can only be obtained in the item selection screen after 
you defeat the boss of a level.

Design: Celestial Weapon (Lilty)
Forged by: Nat Dennim
Weapon: Longinus
Materials: Red Eye, Dragon's Fang, Orichalcum x2, 8000 gil
Strength: 40
Focus Attack: Bladestorm
I don't possess this weapon yet, so I really cannot say anything about 
this weapon. However, someone with the pseudonym DragonQuest gave me an 
e-mail, telling me what the Longinus is like, and here it is.

Submitter's Tip! DragonQuest's Tip
Well after a bit more work to get the Dragon's Fang.  I finally was able 
to forge the Longinus from the Marr's Pass Blacksmith.  It was definitely 
a major improvement from the previous weapons but not anything 
gamebreaking.  The Longinus's focus attack is a 5-hit combo that is 
stopable if you get hit. Once the combo begins, you can't stop it unless 
you get hit or it finishes.  It seems as if it just hits 5 times and nothing 
more.  The hits don't appear to be any stronger than regular hits.  I guess 
it wasn't as disappointing as the force ring though.

Design: Lunar Weapon (Selkie)
Forged by: Nat Dennim
Weapon: Dreamcatcher
Materials: Orichalcum, Wind Crystal, Desert Fang, 5000 gil
Strength: 35
Focus Attack: Meteor Blast
The Dreamcatcher is the mightiest weapon that a Selkie can wield. This 
can be proved by the Focus Attack. The Focus Attack, Meteor Blast will 
send a meteor from the sky onto the ground. This is similar to the Meteor 
Strike move of the Fire Bomb, and has just the same area effect! Now, just 
wait for the enemies to group together, and destruction guaranteed! There 
is one catch, just one catch. It is that you will have to lose half a heart 
whenever you use the Meteor Blast. But still, if you hold a Jade Bracer 
or Healing Headband while you are using it, the effects should not be felt.

Design: Dark Weapon (Clavat)
Forged by: Nat Dennim
Weapon: Ragnarok
Materials: Cursed Crook x1, Ancient Sword x1, Orichalum x1, 5000gil
Strength: 35
Focus Attack: Shadowblade
I have finally found the design for this weapon. The design is obtained 
when you beat Rebena Te Ra with about 177 bonus points. The Ragnarok 
requires two spoils from the bosses, both of which are easily found, as 
they are in Tipa Peninsula. The Ancient Sword is ofund on the Giant Crab, 
while the Cursed Crook is found on the Goblin King. The Ragnarok has a 
very powerful focus attack called the Shadow Blade. The character will 
charge forward, and hit his/her target 3 times in quick sucession. The 
only drawback is that it does not have a long range, and the player will 
lose half a heart every time he/she uses it.

*****ARMOR*****
For many action RPGs, having various pieces of armor that become stronger 
as stronger in the game is a perfectly normal state of affairs. All 
conventional armor can be forged by Arneaux in Marr's Pass. All special 
armor can be forged by Hein Dahl in Alfataria.

As for Armor, I suggest you start upgrading with Iron Armor.

Design: Iron Armor
Forged by: Arneaux
Armor: Iron Plate
Materials: Iron x1, 200 gil
Defense: 17
This is just the first conventional armor upgrade your character can come 
across in this game. This is a bit too medieval really. After all, the 
blacksmiths later should be able to make steel by heating Iron in a Blast 
Furnace. However, Iron Armor is much better than the travel clothes that 
you may appear to be wearing.

Then, upgrade to Mythril Armor.

Design: Mythril Armor
Forged by: Arneaux 
Armor: Mythril Haub.
Materials: Mythril x1, 500 gil
Defense: 22
Mythril Armor is a substantial improvement to the Iron Armor, with an 
increment of 5 from the Iron Armor. Mythril appears in an octahedral from, 
similar to the way Iron and Bronze appear in the map. However, Mythril 
is blue in colour. Although Mythril is available in shops, I would not 
recommend buying Mythril, as it is very expensive, at 5000 gil a chunk. 
Instead, you can kill relatively strong enemies and they may hold Mythril. 
It is very common indeed.

Design: Flame Armor
Forged by: Hein Dahl
Armor: Flame Mail
Materials: Iron x3, Magma Rock x2, 500 gil
Defense: 24
Additional Effect: Resist Fire +1
Flame Mail is the armor that can protect your character against burning 
when Fire is cast on you. Flame Armor has a defense of 24, which has 2 
more than the Mythril Armor. The design for Flame Armor is very common 
in the game, and are usually found on Fire Bombs and other fire element 
enemies. The same applies for the Magma rocks required. As this armor is 
so cheap to design, you should always get it before you have the Diamond 
Armor. Note that 1 point of Resistance to Fire is not enough to withstand 
Fira or Firaga or any equivalent Fire attacks. For protection against those 
attacks, have your Crystal Chalice bear the Fire Element at the same time 
or equip a Flame Badge at the same time.

Design: Lightning Armor
Forged by: Hein Dahl
Armor: Storm Mail
Materials: Iron x3, Thunderball x2, 500 gil
Defense: 24
Additional Effect: Resist Lightning +1
Storm Mail is the armor that can protect your character against electric 
shocks when Thunder is cast on you. Storm Mail has a defense of 24, which 
has 2 more than the Mythril Armor. The design for Lightning Armor is very 
common in the game, and are usually found on Thunder Bombs, Electric 
Jellyfish and other electric element enemies. The same applies for the 
Thunderballs required. As this armor is so cheap to design, you should 
always get it before you have the Diamond Armor. Note that 1 point of 
Resistance to Lightning is not enough to withstand Thundara or Thundaga 
or any equivalent Thunder attacks. For protection against those attacks, 
have your Crystal Chalice bear the Wind Element at the same time or equip 
a Thunder Badge at the same time.

Design: Frost Armor
Forged by: Hein Dahl
Armor: Frost Mail
Materials: Iron x3, Chilly Gel x2, 500 gil
Defense: 24
Additional Effect: Resist Cold +1
Frost Mail is the armor that can protect your character against freezing 
when Blizzard is cast on you. Frost Mail has a defense of 24, which has 
2 more than the Mythril Armor. The design for Frost Armor is also very 
common in the game, and are usually found on Ice Bombs, Water Flans and 
other ice element enemies. The same applies for the Chilly Gel required. 
As this armor is so cheap to design, you should always get it before you 
have the Diamond Armor. Note that 1 point of Resistance to Cold is not 
enough to withstand Blizzara or Blizzaga or any equivalent Blizzard attacks. 
For protection against those attacks, have your Crystal Chalice bear the 
Water Element at the same time or equip a Frost Badge at the same time.

Design: Pure Armor
Forged by: Hein Dahl
Armor: Blessed Mail
Materials: Mythril x1, Holy Water x1, 500 gil
Defense: 23
Additional Effect: Resist Poison +1
The Blessed Mail is an armor that is fitted with a lot of filters inside 
that purifies any poison that may come in contact with you. Therefore, 
your character will not get poisoned as easily as before. The Blessed Mail 
provides a defense of 23, which is 1 more than Mythril Armor, hence it 
may not be worth it. The design for Pure Armor is found in treasure chests 
all around the world, they can be anywhere. Mythril can be found in the 
Mine of Carthuiges as well as other stronger enemies like Goblin Chieftains. 
Holy Water may be found on Wraiths and maybe Coeurls. This is another cheap 
armor to be forged. Note that stronger poison attacks can still poison 
your character even if you are equipped with this armor. For total 
protection, have 2 points of resistance by wearing a Blue Misanga or maybe 
having a Crystal Chalice bearing the Earth Element.

Design: Holy Armor
Forged by: Hein Dahl
Armor: Saintly Mail
Materials: Mythril x1, Heavenly Dust x1, 500 gil
Defense: 23
Additional Effect: Resist Curse +1
Saintly Mail is a sacred armor that allows your character to remain, er... 
heavenly. As they are so saintly and godly, enemies cannot cast Curses 
on you, and regardless of how strong the spell is, it will be automatically 
nullified. Like the rest of them, the Saintly Mail provides a defense of 
23. Heavenly Dust may be found on a Wraith in a Daemon Court. If you do 
not want the trouble, you can just buy some of them from a female merchant 
in Leuda, on Lynari Isle. There is no super Curse, don't worry. If you 
think this armor takes too much space, you can always wear a White Misanga 
instead of this armor.

Design: Time Armor
Forged by: Hein Dahl
Armor: Time Mail
Materials: Mythril x1, Worm Antenna x1, 500 gil
Defense: 23
Additional Effect: Resist Slow +1
The Time Mail is an armor that keeps time for your character. It causes 
the space time continuum to remain constant, and hence making your 
character more resistant to the slowing of time, and hence they will be 
harder to slow down. Time Mail requires a Worm Antenna in addition to 
Mythril to be crafted. Worm Antenna, well, is found on a Carrion Worm. 
It is just so easy to find. This is yet another suit of cheap armor. Note 
that moves like Slowga can still have the power to slow your character 
down if they are wearing Time Mail. For total protection, wear an Accurate 
Watch to provide a total of two points of resistance to slow.

Design: Eternal Armor
Forged by: Hein Dahl
Armor: Eternal Mail
Materials: Mythril x1, Toad Oil x1, 500 gil
Defense: 23
Additional Effect: Resist Stasis +1
The Eternal Mail is an armor that is even cooler than the Time Mail. This 
armor has the ability to maintain the eternal passage of time. Therefore, 
time cannot be stopped at all, and your character cannot be stopped and 
put in stasis. Like the rest of the non-elemental protection armor, the 
Eternal Mail provides a defense of 23 for your character, which is 1 point 
higher than the Mythril Armor. It's up to you to decide if it is worth 
it. Toad Oil is found on a Gigan Toad, which can be found in wetlands like 
Veo Lu Sluice and Conall Curach. The Gigan Toads are weaker in Veo Lu Sluice, 
and that is where you can go toad hunting. The good news is that, as there 
is only Stop. Wearing this armor can ensure that you can never be put in 
stasis. If you think this piece of armor has taken too much space, wear 
an Unfaltering Watch instead.

Design: Gold Armor
Forged by: Hein Dahl
Armor: Gold Mail
Materials: Gold x1, Mythril x1, Shiny Shard x1, 500 gil
Defense: 24
Additional Effect: Resist Stone +1
This gold armor looks just so valuable, and yet Hein Dahl is willing to 
charge you only 500 gil for such expensive armor! Gold Armor is made of 
gold of course. For some strange reason, the designers of this game have 
allowed it to help your character resist Stone with it. In other words, 
you will be less likely to be petrified by enemies when you are wearing 
this armor. The good news is that it provides the same defense as the Flame 
Mail. Therefore, it would be more worthwhile to forge it out for your use. 
However, that is not the end of the story. There still exist some extra 
strong attacks that can petrify you even with this armor. For extra 
protection, have your Crystal Chalice bear the Earth element, or just wear 
an extra gold necklace.

Design: Radiant Armor
Forged by: Hein Dahl
Armor: Crystal Mail
Materials: Mythril x1, Tiny Crystal x1, 500 gil
Defense: 24
Additional Effect: Resist Miasma +1
Wow, this armor has the essence of the crystal inside it. Therefore, wearing 
this suit of armor is like having a miniature crystal chalice on you. 
Therefore, your character can resist miasma more than before. To be more 
precise, your character can now venture out to the miasma, and it will 
take a considerably longer time for him/her to receive damage due to the 
miasma. However, I just don't find it very practical though. After all, 
why would one like to venture out into the miasma all the time? But still, 
this armor provides your character with a Defense of 24, which is just 
as good as Flame Armor. For additional protection, wear a Crystal Ring, 
or never leave the Crystal's Aura at all!

The ultimate armor for all 4 tribes but 1 is the Diamond Armor. You can 
get it from the Item Selection Screen after you beat the boss. Otherwise, 
you can look for the design in later levels.

Design: Diamond Armor
Forged by: Arneaux
Armor: Diamond Plate
Materials: Orichalcum x1, Hard Shell x1, Diamond Ore x1, 2500 gil
Defense: 27
Wow, this is one thing that I have never seen before. Armor made from Diamond! 
As diamonds are basically the hardest substance ever to be found on earth, 
I really would be surprised to find blacksmiths in this game having the 
technology to craft such strong armor. As it is so hard, you get another 
5 point increment in defense over the Mythril Armor, and you would prove 
a tough nut to crack when you are wearing it. (Say, isn't diamond a little 
bit heavy?) Of course, you cannot just make armor with diamonds alone, 
in addition to Diamond Ore, you will need a chunk of Orichalcum, which 
appears as yellow tetrahedrals in the playing field. Orichalcum cannot 
be bought, but can be found in the hands of many strong enemies like the 
Behemoths and Zus in harder levels of the game. If you would not bother 
to kill those monsters, you will just have to wait for the item to appear 
for selection in the Item Selection Screen. The Hard Shell is found on 
Blazer Beetles, which are not hard to kill.

For the Clavats, it does not stop here. They also can get the Earth Armor 
design, found in the Item Selection screen.

Design: Earth Armor (Clavat)
Forged by: Arneaux
Armor: Gaia Plate
Materials: Lord's Robe, King's Scale, Orichalcum x2, 5000 gil
Defense: 30
This is the ultimate armor of Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles. From the 
manual, you will find that Clavats are specializing in defense, and the 
presence of this unique armor is there to prove it. With 2 chunks of the 
rare Orichalcum, the Lord's Robe of the Gigas Lord of the Moschet Manor, 
the King's Scale of the Lizardman King of the Daemon Court, you get the 
finest materials from all over the world to produce the Gaia Plate. Finding 
the design for this armor is another story. To find it, you must beat a 
boss with a high score and hope that it will be up for grabs in the Item 
Selection Screen. Then, you will have to beat the Gigas Lord and Lizard 
Man King with high scores and hope that you get to salvage them in the 
selection screen. All this effort will pay back in the air. Just don't 
lose heart, all you Clavat players out there!

*****SHIELDS FOR CLAVATS*****
Design: Iron Shield
Forged by: Arneaux 
Shield: Iron Shield
Materials: Iron x1, 150 gil
Defense: 10
This is just the first conventional shield upgrade your Clavat can come 
across in this game. This is a bit too medieval really. After all, the 
blacksmiths later should be able to make steel by heating Iron in a Blast 
Furnace. However, the Iron Shield is much better than the makeshift shield 
(Fake Shield, a forgery!) that you may appear to be wearing.

Design: Mythril Shield
Forged by: Arneaux
Shield: Mythril Shield
Materials: Mythril x1, 400 gil
Defense: 15
The Mythril Shield is a substantial improvement to the Iron Shield, with 
an increment of 5 from the Iron Shield. Mythril appears in an octahedral 
from, similar to the way Iron and Bronze appear in the map. However, Mythril 
is blue in colour. Although Mythril is available in shops, I would not 
recommend buying Mythril, as it is very expensive, at 5000 gil a chunk. 
Instead, you can kill relatively strong enemies and they may hold Mythril. 
It is very common indeed.

Design: Flame Shield
Forged by: Hein Dahl
Shield: Flame Shield
Materials: Iron x2, Magma Rock x1, 400 gil
Defense: 17
Additional Effect: Resist Fire +1
Flame Shield is the shield that can protect your character against burning 
when Fire is cast on you. Flame Shield has a defense of 17, which has 2 
more than the Mythril Shield. The design for Flame Shield is very common 
in the game, and are usually found on Fire Bombs and other fire element 
enemies. The same applies for the Magma rocks required. As this shield 
is so cheap to design, you should always get it before you have the Diamond 
Shield. Note that 1 point of Resistance to Fire is not enough to withstand 
Fira or Firaga or any equivalent Fire attacks. For protection against those 
attacks, have your Crystal Chalice bear the Fire Element at the same time 
or equip a Flame Badge at the same time.

Design: Lightning Shield
Forged by: Hein Dahl
Shield: Storm Shield
Materials: Iron x2, Thunderball x1, 400 gil
Defense: 17
Additional Effect: Resist Lightning +1
Storm Shield is the shield that can protect your character against electric 
shocks when Thunder is cast on you. Storm Mail has a defense of 17, which 
has 2 more than the Mythril Shield. The design for Lightning Shield is 
very common in the game, and are usually found on Thunder Bombs, Electric 
Jellyfish and other electric element enemies. The same applies for the 
Thunderballs required. As this shield is so cheap to design, you should 
always get it before you have the Diamond Shield. Note that 1 point of 
Resistance to Lightning is not enough to withstand Thundara or Thundaga 
or any equivalent Thunder attacks. For protection against those attacks, 
have your Crystal Chalice bear the Wind Element at the same time or equip 
a Thunder Badge at the same time.

Design: Frost Shield
Forged by: Hein Dahl
Shield: Frost Shield
Materials: Iron x2, Chilly Gel x1, 400 gil
Defense: 17
Additional Effect: Resist Cold +1
Frost Mail is the armor that can protect your character against freezing 
when Blizzard is cast on you. Frost Mail has a defense of 17, which has 
2 more than the Mythril Shield. The design for Frost Shield is also very 
common in the game, and are usually found on Ice Bombs, Water Flans and 
other ice element enemies. The same applies for the Chilly Gel required. 
As this shield is so cheap to design, you should always get it before you 
have the Diamond Shield. Note that 1 point of Resistance to Cold is not 
enough to withstand Blizzara or Blizzaga or any equivalent Blizzard attacks. 
For protection against those attacks, have your Crystal Chalice bear the 
Water Element at the same time or equip a Frost Badge at the same time.

Design: Holy Shield
Forged by: Hein Dahl
Shield: Saintly Shield
Materials: Mythril x1, Heavenly Dust x1, 400 gil
Defense: 18
Additional Effect: Resist Curse +1
The Clavats are going on a crusade with this one. Saintly Shield is a sacred 
shield that allows your character to remain, er... heavenly. As they are 
so saintly and godly, enemies cannot cast Curses on you, and regardless 
of how strong the spell is, it will be automatically nullified. Unlike 
the rest of them, the Saintly Mail provides a defense of 18. Heavenly Dust 
may be found on a Wraith in a Daemon Court. If you do not want the trouble, 
you can just buy some of them from a female merchant in Leuda, on Lynari 
Isle. There is no super Curse, don't worry. If you think this shield takes 
too much space, you can always wear a White Misanga instead of this shield.

Design: Magic Shield
Forged by: Hein Dahl
Shield: Rune Shield
Materials: Bronze x1, Coeurl's Whisker x2, 400 gil
Defense: 18
Additional Effect: Spell Range +20
This is just another proof that the Clavats are the most all rounded tribes 
in the game. They get a decent attack, decent defense, and yet their magic 
abilities can still be upgraded with a single Shield. A Rune Shield, like 
the Saintly Shield will provide your character with 18 Defense, which is 
3 more than the Mythril Shield. You can now cast spells further than before 
with this shield. At the same time, the materials are easy to collect. 
The Coeurl's Whisker can be found on Coeurls in Daemon's Court and the 
Moschet Manor. Feel free to use this armor before you get the Diamond Shield, 
you'll like it! The design is found in the mushroom forest.

Design: Diamond Shield
Forged by: Arneaux
Shield: Diamond Shield
Materials: Orichalcum x1, Diamond Ore x1, 2000 gil
Defense: 22
Wow, this is one thing that I have never seen before. A Shield made from 
Diamond! As diamonds are basically the hardest substance ever to be found 
on earth, I really would be surprised to find blacksmiths in this game 
having the technology to craft such strong armor. As it is so hard, you 
get another 5 point increment in defense over the Mythril Shield, and you 
would prove a tough nut to crack when you are wearing it. (Say, isn't diamond 
a little bit heavy, it is amazing that the poor Clavat won't be weighed 
down with such a heavy shield strapped to his left arm) Of course, you 
cannot just make shields with diamonds alone, in addition to Diamond Ore, 
you will need a chunk of Orichalcum, which appears as yellow tetrahedrals 
in the playing field. Orichalcum cannot be bought, but can be found in 
the hands of many strong enemies like the Behemoths and Zus in harder levels 
of the game. If you would not bother to kill those monsters, you will just 
have to wait for the item to appear for selection in the Item Selection 
Screen. Unlike the Diamond Armor, you do not need a Hard Shell.

The Clavats get to use the Legendary Shield design exclusively, found in 
the Item Selection Screen as well. At least, that is how I got the design. 
This gives the Clavats another 3 point lead over the other tribesmen in 
the Defense department.

Design: Legendary Shield
Forged by: Arneaux
Armor: Chocobo Shield
Materials: Orichalcum x2, Yellow Feather x1, 3000gil
Defense 25
This is the ultimate shield of the game. This is here to prove to the players 
that the Clavats really are specializing in defense. In fact, when this 
shield is equipped in conjunction of the Gaia Plate, the Clavats get to 
have a 6 point lead in the defense department over the other tribes are 
stuck with diamond defenses. The Chocobo Shield is a shield with the 
inscription of the legendary bird, the Chocobo. It is gold in colour, and 
I guess it should be lighter than the Diamond Shield. Tee hee. This time, 
if you want to craft the Legendary Shield for your Clavat, you must find 
two chunks of Orichalcum, instead of one, and that is not a difficult task 
if you can visit places like Conall Curach or the Lynari Desert, as there 
are multiple enemies with chunks of Orichalcum. However, you must be very 
careful, as Behemoths and Zus are very tough. As for the Yellow Feather, 
I guess it is there for decorative purposes, as the Chocobo is a bird. 
A Yellow Feather can be found in the hands of a Tonberry Chef in the Moschet 
Manor. I am sure that at least one of them will hold a feather.

*****GAUNTLETS FOR LILTIES*****
Design: Bronze Gloves
Forged by: Arneaux
Gauntlets: Bronze Gauntlets
Materials: Bronze x1, 80 gil
Defense: 8
This is a small and weak upgrade for your Lilty. It is so cheap and useless 
that I suggest you save up for a pair of Iron Gauntlets instead. That 80 
gil can be used for other constructive purposes.

Design: Iron Gloves
Forged by: Arneaux
Gauntlets: Iron Gauntlets
Materials: Iron x1, 150 gil
Defense: 12
This is just the first real conventional gauntlet upgrade your Lilty can 
come across in this game. This is a bit too medieval really. After all, 
the blacksmiths later should be able to make steel by heating Iron in a 
Blast Furnace. However, the Iron Shield is much better than the Gauntlets 
(Plain, must be made of leather) that you may appear to be wearing.

Design: Mythril Gloves
Forged by: Arneaux
Gauntlets: Mythril Gauntlets
Materials: Mythril x1, 400 gil
Defense: 15
The Mythril Gauntlets are a substantial improvement to the Iron Gauntlets, 
with an increment of 3 from the Iron Gauntlets. Mythril appears in an 
octahedral from, similar to the way Iron and Bronze appear in the map. 
However, Mythril is blue in colour. Although Mythril is available in shops, 
I would not recommend buying Mythril, as it is very expensive, at 5000 
gil a chunk. Instead, you can kill relatively strong enemies and they may 
hold Mythril. It is very common indeed.

Design: Flame Gloves
Forged by: Hein Dahl
Gauntlets: Flame Armlets
Materials: Iron x2, Magma Rock x1, 400 gil
Defense: 17
Additional Effect: Resist Fire +1
Flame Armlets are the gauntlets that can protect your character against 
burning when Fire is cast on you. Flame Armlets have a defense of 17, which 
has 2 more than the Mythril Gauntlets. The design for Flame Armlets is 
very common in the game, and are usually found on Fire Bombs and other 
fire element enemies. The same applies for the Magma rocks required. As 
these Armlets are so cheap to design, you should always get them before 
you have the Diamond Armlets. Note that 1 point of Resistance to Fire is 
not enough to withstand Fira or Firaga or any equivalent Fire attacks. 
For protection against those attacks, have your Crystal Chalice bear the 
Fire Element at the same time or equip a Flame Badge at the same time.

Design: Lightning Gauntlets
Forged by: Hein Dahl
Gauntlets: Storm Armlets
Materials: Iron x2, Thunderball x1, 400 gil
Defense: 17
Additional Effect: Resist Lightning +1
Storm Armlets are the gauntlets that can protect your character against 
electric shocks when Thunder is cast on you. Storm Armlets have a defense 
of 17, which has 2 more than the Mythril Gauntlets. The design for Lightning 
Armlets is very common in the game, and are usually found on Thunder Bombs, 
Electric Jellyfish and other electric element enemies. The same applies 
for the Thunderballs required. As these Armlets are so cheap to design, 
you should always get them before you have the Diamond Armlets. Note that 
1 point of Resistance to Lightning is not enough to withstand Thundara 
or Thundaga or any equivalent Thunder attacks. For protection against those 
attacks, have your Crystal Chalice bear the Wind Element at the same time 
or equip a Thunder Badge at the same time.

Design: Frost Gloves
Forged by: Hein Dahl
Gauntlets: Frost Armlets
Materials: Iron x2, Chilly Gel x1, 400 gil
Defense: 17
Additional Effect: Resist Cold +1
Frost Armlets are the gauntlets that can protect your character against 
freezing when Blizzard is cast on you. Frost Armlets have a defense of 
17, which has 2 more than the Mythril Gauntlets. The design for Frost 
Armlets is also very common in the game, and are usually found on Ice Bombs, 
Water Flans and other ice element enemies. The same applies for the Chilly 
Gel required. As these armlets are so cheap to design, you should always 
get them before you have the Diamond Armlets. Note that 1 point of 
Resistance to Cold is not enough to withstand Blizzara or Blizzaga or any 
equivalent Blizzard attacks. For protection against those attacks, have 
your Crystal Chalice bear the Water Element at the same time or equip a 
Frost Badge at the same time.

Design: Gold Gloves
Forged by: Hein Dahl
Gauntlets: Gold Armlets
Materials: Gold x1, Mythril x1, Cockatrice Scale x1, 400 gil
Defense: 18
Additional Effect: Resist Stone +1
The Lilties do have a very good fashion sense. In fact, they don't mind 
wearing gauntlets that are made of gold! Wouldn't it be too heavy for them 
to carry their weapons while doing so? Anyway, the Gold Gloves are specially 
designed gloves that protect your character against turning into stone. 
Along with the Gold and Mythril that can be found in shops, you will need 
a Cockatrice Scale, found on a Cockatrice in the Mine of Carthuiges or 
Selepation Cave. The Gold Gloves provide a defence of 18 for your character. 
Which is 3 more than the Mythril Armor, and hence this is the best armor 
before you obtain the Diamond Armlets. However, that is not the end of 
the story. There still exist some extra strong attacks that can petrify 
you even with this armor. For extra protection, have your Crystal Chalice 
bear the Earth element, or just wear an extra gold necklace.

Design: Diamond Gloves
Forged by: Arneaux
Shield: Diamond Armlets
Materials: Orichalcum x1, Diamond Ore x1, 2000 gil
Defense: 22
Wow, this is one thing that I have never seen before. A pair of Armlets 
made from Diamond! As diamonds are basically the hardest substance ever 
to be found on earth, I really would be surprised to find blacksmiths in 
this game having the technology to craft such strong armor. As it is so 
hard, you get another 5 point increment in defense over the Mythril 
Gauntlets, and you would prove a tough nut to crack when you are wearing 
it. (Say, isn't diamond a little bit heavy, it is amazing that the poor 
Lilty won't be weighed down if they have to wear such heavy armlets on 
both of their tiny hands) Of course, you cannot just make armlets with 
diamonds alone, in addition to Diamond Ore, you will need a chunk of 
Orichalcum, which appears as yellow tetrahedrals in the playing field. 
Orichalcum cannot be bought, but can be found in the hands of many strong 
enemies like the Behemoths and Zus in harder levels of the game. If you 
would not bother to kill those monsters, you will just have to wait for 
the item to appear for selection in the Item Selection Screen. Unlike the 
Diamond Armor, you do not need a Hard Shell.

*****HELMS FOR YUKES*****
Design: Bronze Sallet
Forged by: Arneaux
Gauntlets: Bronze Helm
Materials: Bronze x1, 80 gil
Defense: 8
This is a small and weak upgrade for your Yuke. It is so cheap and useless 
that I suggest you save up for an Iron Helm instead. That 80 gil can be 
used for other constructive purposes.

Design: Iron Sallet
Forged by: Arneaux
Gauntlets: Iron Helm
Materials: Iron x1, 150 gil
Defense: 12
This is just the first real conventional Helm upgrade your Yuke can come 
across in this game. This is a bit too medieval really. After all, the 
blacksmiths later should be able to make steel by heating Iron in a Blast 
Furnace. However, the Iron Helm is much better than the Helm (Plain, must 
be made of an old teapot or something) that you may appear to be wearing.

Design: Mythril Sallet
Forged by: Arneaux
Gauntlets: Mythril Helm
Materials: Mythril x1, 400 gil
Defense: 15
The Mythril Gauntlets are a substantial improvement to the Iron Helm, with

Design: Time Sallet
Forged by: Hein Dahl
Helm: Time Helm
Materials: Mythril x1, Worm Antenna x1, 400 gil
Defense: 18
Additional Effect: Resist Slow +1
The Time Helm is an armor helm that keeps time for your character. It causes 
the space time continuum to remain constant, and hence making your 
character more resistant to the slowing of time, and hence they will be 
harder to slow down. The Defense provided is 18, which is 3 more than the 
Mythril Helm. Time Helm requires a Worm Antenna in addition to Mythril 
to be crafted. Worm Antenna, well, is found on a Carrion Worm. It is just 
so easy to find. This is yet another suit of cheap armor. Note that moves 
like Slowga can still have the power to slow your character down if they 
are wearing Time Mail. For total protection, wear an Accurate Watch to 
provide a total of two points of resistance to slow.

Design: Eternal Sallet
Forged by: Hein Dahl
Helm: Eternal Helm
Materials: Mythril x1, Worm Antenna x1, 400 gil
Defense: 18
Additional Effect: Resist Stasis +1
The Eternal Helm is a helm that is even cooler than the Time Helm. This 
helm has the ability to maintain the eternal passage of time. Therefore, 
time cannot be stopped at all, and your character cannot be stopped and 
put in stasis. Like the rest of the non-elemental protection helms, the 
Eternal Helm provides a defense of 18 for your character, which is 3 points 
higher than the Mythril Helm. Therefore, it is just as worth it as the 
Time Helm. Toad Oil is found on a Gigan Toad, which can be found in wetlands 
like Veo Lu Sluice and Conall Curach. The Gigan Toads are weaker in Veo 
Lu Sluice, and that is where you can go toad hunting. The good news is 
that, as there is only Stop. Wearing this helm can ensure that you can 
never be put in stasis. If you think this helm has taken too much space, 
wear an Unfaltering Watch instead.

Design: Diamond Sallet

Shield: Diamond Helm

Gauntlets: Iron Belt
Materials: Iron x1, 150 gil
Defense: 12
This is just the first real conventional Belt upgrade your Selkie can come 
across in this game. This is a bit too medieval really. After all, the 
blacksmiths later should be able to make steel by heating Iron in a Blast 
Furnace. However, the Iron Helm is much better than the Old Belt (Second 
hand goods are never any good) that you may appear to be wearing.

Design: Mythril Belt
Forged by: Arneaux
Gauntlets: Mythril Belt
Materials: Mythril x1, 400 gil
Defense: 15
The Mythril Gauntlets are a substantial improvement to the Iron bELT, with

Belt: Flame Sash
Materials: Iron x2, Magma Rock x1, 400 gil
Defense: 17
Additional Effect: Resist Fire +1
Flame Sash is the belt that can protect your character against burning 
when Fire is cast on you. A Flame Sash has a defense of 17, which has 2 
more than the Mythril Belt. The design for Flame Belt is very common in 
the game, and is usually found on Fire Bombs and other fire element enemies. 
The same applies for the Magma rocks required. As this Sash is so cheap

Note that 1 point of Resistance to Fire is not enough to withstand Fira

Design: Pure Belt
Forged by: Nat Dennim
Belt: Blessed Sash
Materials: Mythril x1, Holy Water x1, 400 gil
Defense: 18
Additional Effect: Resist Poison +1
The Blessed Sash is a belt that is fitted with a lot of filters inside 
that purifies any poison that may come in contact with you. Therefore, 
your character will not get poisoned as easily as before. The Blessed Sash 
provides a defense of 18, which is 3 more than Mythril Belt, hence it will 
be very worth it. The design for Pure Belt is found in treasure chests 
all around the world, they can be anywhere. Mythril can be found in the 
Mine of Carthuiges as well as other stronger enemies like Goblin Chieftains. 
Holy Water may be found on Wraiths and maybe Coeurls. This is another cheap 
belt to be forged. Note that stronger poison attacks can still poison your 
character even if you are equipped with this belt. For total protection, 
have 2 points of resistance by wearing a Blue Misanga or maybe having a 
Crystal Chalice bearing the Earth Element.

Design: Wind Belt
Forged by: Nat Dennim
Belt: Winged Belt
Materials: Mythril x1, Griffin's Wing x2, 400 gil
Defense: 18
Additional Effect: Focus Attack Range +20
It's no wonder that the Selkies got the best focus attack in the game. 
Not only they charge Focus Attacks the fastest, they also can have a 
specially designed armor to make them fire their attacks from a longer 
range! This is the whole purpose of the weapon. Like the Blessed Sash, 
the Winged Belt provides a defense of 18 to the character wearing it. 
Therefore, this is the best belt before the Diamond Belt. As it is a winged 
belt, wings must be crafted on the belt. Therefore, you will need 2 
Griffin's Wings, which can be found at River Belle Path or Veo Lu Sluice. 
An easy and powerful belt indeed. The design is very rare, though.

Design: Diamond Belt
Forged by: Arneaux
Belt: Diamond Belt
Materials: Orichalcum x1, Diamond Ore x1, 2000 gil

b. Accessories [A2B]
---------------------
Like most action RPGs, or RPGs in general, Final Fantasy provides items 
that can be equipped to protect or enhance the characters' abilities. These 
items come in form of accessories, to be crafted by a tailor named Spiran 
in Shella.

*****ACCESSORIES FOR ALL*****
Design: Flame Craft
Accessory: Flame Badge
Materials: Iron Shard x2, Magma Rock x1, 300 gil
Effect: Resist Fire +1
By wearing this badge, your character will resist Fire, and will not be 
burnt as easily as before. The Magma Rock is found in the hands of Fire 
Element enemies like Fire Bombs, Fire Mus and so on. Same can be said for 
the design for this badge. Note that wearing a Flame Badge alone is not 
sufficient to protect your character against stronger Fire attacks like 
Fira and Firaga, and hence you should wear this in conjunction with a 
Crystal Chalice with a Fire Element for the maximum effect.

Design: Lightning Craft
Accessory: Thunder Badge
Materials: Iron Shard x2, Thunderball x1, 300 gil
Effect: Resist Lightning +1
By wearing this badge, your character will resist lightning, and will not 
be shocked as easily as before. The Thunderball is found in the hands of 
Electric Element enemies like Electric Bombs, Electric Scorpions and so 
on. Same can be said for the design for this badge. Note that wearing a 
Thunder Badge alone is not sufficient to protect your character against 
stronger Thunder attacks like Thundara and Thundaga, and hence you should 
wear this in conjunction with a Crystal Chalice with a Wind Element for 
the maximum effect.

Design: Frost Craft
Accessory: Frost Badge
Materials: Iron Shard x2, Chilly Gel x1, 300 gil
Effect: Resist Cold +1
By wearing this badge, your character will resist Cold, and will not be 
frozen in as easily as before. The Chilly Gel is found in the hands of 
Ice Element enemies like Ice Bombs, Snow Mus and so on. Same can be said 
for the design for this badge. Note that wearing a Frost Badge alone is 
not sufficient to protect your character against stronger Blizzaard 
attacks like Blizzara and Blizzaga, and hence you should wear this in 
conjunction with a Crystal Chalice with a Water Element for the maximum 
effect.

Design: Blue Yarn
Accessory: Blue Misanga
Materials: Needle x1, Blue Silk x1, 300 gil
Effect: Resist Poison +1
By wearing this misanga, I guess it's some kind of cloak, or cape or 
something like that, your character will gain some protection from all 
the poisons that they encounter in this game. Must be some kind of lab 
gown for Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles. The wearer will gain one point 
of resistance to poison, and hence will not be poisoned as often. The Needle 
is found on a Cactuar in Lynari Desert, while the Blue Silk can be bought 
from a merchant in Leuda, or found on a Ghost. Note that there exist some 
poisonous attacks that are much stronger, and to protect against those, 
have your Crystal Chalice bear the Earth Element at the same time.

Design: White Yarn
Accessory: White Misanga
Materials: Needle x1, White Silk x1, 300 gil
Effect: Resist Poison +1
By wearing this misanga, I guess it's some kind of cloak, or cape or 
something like that, your character will gain some protection from all 
the curses that they encounter in this game. Must be some kind of priest 
gown for Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles. The wearer will gain one point 
of resistance to curse, and hence will never be cursed. The Needle is found 
on a Cactuar in Lynari Desert, while the White Silk can found on a Ghost. 
I am not sure whether it can be bought from a merchant or not at the time 
being.

Design: Clockwork
Accessory: Accurate Watch
Materials: Bronze Shard x3, Worm Antenna x1, Gear x1, 300 gil
Effect: Resist Slow +1
Well, I guess this is one of the two ways for the people in the world of 
Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles. Therefore, they must be in the year 
1500 or after, as watches were invented during the Renaissance. The 
accurate watch is so accurate, maybe more accurate than the Caesium powered 
Atomic Clock, so accurate that it can maintain the steady flow of time. 
Therefore, time won't be slowed, and your character will become resistant 
to slowness. However, there is a stronger spell called Slowga, that cannot 
be protected simply by wearing this watch. You would have to equip Time 
Armor at the same time. Understand?

Design: New Clockwork
Accessory: Unfaltering Watch
Materials: Bronze Shard x3, Toad Oil x1, Gear x1
Effect: Resist Stasis +1
Well, I guess this is the second of the two ways for the people in the 
world of Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles to keep time. Therefore, they 
must be in the year 1500 or after, as watches were invented during the 
Renaissance. The unfaltering watch is so accurate, and is also unfaltering. 
Maybe more accurate than the Caesium powered Atomic Clock, so accurate 
and reliable that it can maintain the steady flow of time. Therefore, time 
won't be stopped, and your character will become resistant to stasis. My 
bet is that the Toad Oil here is used as a lubricant for the Gear to prevent 
wearing down of parts. No wonder that this watch will never falters.

Design: Gold Craft
Accessory: Gold Necklace
Materials: Gold x2, Cockatrice Scale x1, 300 gil
Effect: Resist Stone +1
This is another beautifully crafted accessory made from pure gold. Well, 
it can really attract the ladies. Only joking. Anyway, the Gold Craft will 
enable your character to Resist Stone, so they will not be stoned as often. 
Oops, I mean, they will not be turned into stone as often as before. It 
seems that anything that is made of gold in this game can help prevent 
petrifaction of your character. I bet the Cockatrice Scale is used as the 
jewel component of the necklace. Note that there exist stronger attacks 
that can turn your character into stone even if they are wearing the 
necklace. You can stop that by using the Earth Element as well.

Design: Ring of Light
Accessory: Crystal Ring
Materials: Silver x1, Tiny Crystal, 1000 gil
Effect: Resist Miasma +30
A Crystal Ring, well this is one of the many accessories women will swoon 
over in the real world. However, in Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles, 
wearing this ring has an additional effect on the character than attracting 
men to come over. As the ring has the essence of the crystal in it, your 
character will be partially protecting against miasma, and will take damage 
much slower than before when they leave the Crystal's Aura. Well, I guess 
we all know how this ring is made. The Silver is used to make the metallic 
portion of the ring, while the Tiny Crystal is the jewel. But still, who 
would be bothered to run out to the miasma?

Design: Ring of Invincibility
Accessory: Force Ring
Materials: Orichalcum x1, Dark Sphere x1, 50000 gil
Effect: Resist Attack +1
This ring has been dubbed by many as the best accessory in the game. Probably 
because it required very expensive materials and such a high price. Dark 
Spheres are to be bought from the merchant of your village for 50000 gil 
if there are no discounts. It is also crafted at your village tailor for 
a sum of 50000 gil! To get the design, you must have an Alchemist as your 
father, and he will give it to you after 14 years of sending materials 
home. This rings allows your character to resist attack, but what it really 
means is that your character can never be knocked back when attack. 
Therefore, I do not find this accessory to be worth it all. I find another 
one more valuable, and it is much more easily accessible.

*****ACCESSORIES FOR WOMEN*****
Design: Lady's Accessories
Accessory: Flower Bracer
Materials: Silver x2, Ruby x1, Pressed Flower x1, 400 gil
Effect: Casting Time -5
It is very easy to tell that this accessory is for women. When you pick 
it up from Maggie's Room in the Moschet Manor, you pick the design up and 
it is called Lady's Accessories. Well, it is made of Silver, a Ruby and 
a pressed flower, I guess it is because women like flowers, as they are 
poetic. The pressed flower can be found anywhere, but has a 50% chance 
of appearing on the Sahagin Lord of Conall Curach. When equipped, the female 
character's spell charging times will be slightly decreased. Then you can 
cast spells faster. Is it really that useful? Well, I don't think so, not 
a larger enough decrement.

Design: Fashion Kit
Accessory: Jade Bracer
Materials: Silver x2, Jade x1, Pressed Flower, 2500 gil
Effect: Regen
This is just as easy for me to tell that it is an accessory for women. 
This is also picked up from Maggie's room in Moschet Manor. It is called 
a fashion kit. Now, I don't want to stereotype all the women out there, 
but it seems that women like to buy more clothes than men! (My mom still 
buys clothes for me! I have no fashion sense.) It seems the latest fashion 
in the world of Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles is to wear bracers that 
give Regen status to the wearer. But what is a Regen status, well, to put 
it simply is that your female character will recover health much more 
quickly than normal. Therefore, this has got to be the best accessory for 
women out there, in my opinion. Try it, you can be guaranteed that you 
won't be using Cure even once! Good for "Don't heal yourself" bonus.

*****ACCESSORIES FOR MEN*****
Design: Zeal Kit
Accessory: Zeal Headband
Materials: Blue Silk x1, Tiny Crystal x1, Remedy x1, 400 gil
Effect: Focus Attack Charge Time -5
Well, this is just the kind of accessory for men, a headband. I always 
thought the noun form of zealous was zealousy, but I was proven wrong two 
years ago when I learned of the word zeal. Anyway, any men wearing this 
headband would become more zealous than before, but not as zealous as those 
Japanese Kamikaze pilots! But still, they will be affected in a way that 
their focus attack charge time will be slightly decreased. This is just 
as cool as the flower bracer. At the same time, the Remedy can also be 
found on the Sahagin Lord in Conall Curach. But if your father is an 
alchemist, he may mail you this item, so always read the mail. However, 
one thing for certain is that -5 is not a big enough decrement. It is hardly 
noticeable. Therefore, equip better accessories, I tell you.

Design: Healing Kit
Accessory: Healing Headband
Materials: White Silk x1, Tiny Crystal x1, Remedy x1, 2500 gil
Effect: Regen
This is yet another headband for all those zealous male characters or I 
should say, warriors out there. The Healing Headband is just another of 
those accessories suitable for those sporty types out there, including 
one of my main characters in the party. Well, the Healing Headband, like 
the Jade Bracer, gives Regen status to the wearer, meaning that he will 
gain health over time much more quickly than before. In my opinion, this 
is obviously the best accessory that a male character can get his hands 
on, and it is also 20 times cheaper to craft than that annoying little 
Force Ring! See? You want the best? Here it is.

*****ACCESSORIES FOR CLAVATS*****
Design: Daemon Kit
Accessory: Devil's Earring
Materials: Silver x1, Devil's Claw x1, 1200 gil
Effect: Status Change Effects +60
Yes, they actually got the nerve to name the design after the notorious 
Mailer-Daemon, the address that deals with rejected e-mails on ISPs. The 
Daemon Kit is used to design the Devil's Earring, an accessory for Clavats. 
Yes, Silver is very easy to find, but the Devil's Claw is another story. 
To get a Devil's Claw, you will have to go all the way to Rebena Te Ra 
and defeat a Nightmare. Then, he may drop a Devil's Claw to you after it 
dies. As for the effect it has on your player, it raises the status change 
effects on your character by 60, which means that whenever you cast a spell 
on an enemy that induces a Status Ailment, it will be affected for longer. 
This is good especially on Fire, then they can be burnt for a long time, 
allowing for more extra powered hits.

Design: Secrets of Wisdom
Accessory: Wisdom Talisman
Materials: Needle x1, Chimera's Horn x1, 1200 gil
Effect: Casting Time -15
I always thought that the Yukes are the wisest race of the 4 tribes. However, 
I guess I am proved wrong with this accessory. Well, this accessory promotes 
wisdom on your little Clavat, and will allow him/her to cast spells quicker. 
To be more precise, Clavats can cast most spells as fast as the Yukes do 
with this accessory. I guess the Clavats are really benefiting from the 
Casting Time -15 effect. However, finding the materials for the accessory 
is another story. To be able to craft the Wisdom Talisman, you must go 
all the way to Lynari Desert. There will be Cactuars to provide the Needle, 
while there are some very tough Chimeras to supply the Chimera's Horn for 
you to enjoy. Enjoy! Just don't get killed!

Design: Twisted Scope
Accessory: Designer Glasses
Materials: Gold x1, Crystal Ball x2, Chimera's Horn x1, 1200 gil
Effect: Spell Range +20
Now, since when are all the Clavats short sighted? Why would they ever 
need to wear glasses? Well, I guess these glasses are not to deal with 
eye defects, but are there to help enhance your vision. For one thing, 
your Clavat will be able to see further away, and hence they can be casting 
spells at a longer range than before. The Gold is used to make the frame, 
the Crystal Balls are to make the lenses, while the Chimera's Horn is 
probably a decoration. Crystal Balls can be bought from a merchant in Leuda, 
while the Chimera's Horn can be obtained from a Chimera. It is entirely 
up to decide whether it is worth it to craft such glasses.

*****ACCESSORIES FOR LILTIES*****
Design: Faerie Kit
Accessories: Pixie's Earring
Materials: Silver x1, Faerie's Tear x1, 400 gil
Effect: Resist Status Changes +30
With the Pixie's Earring, your Lilty will resist status changes by 30. 
This means that, whenever a Lilty suffers from a status ailment like burns, 
curse, poison and others, he/she will lose the ailment much quicker than 
before. Is that clear? This is particularly helpful when you are in a 
situation that you are affected by a status ailment, and that there are 
so many enemies surrounding you that you cannot cast Clear on yourself, 
then this earring may save your life. The Faerie's Tear can be found on 
an Ahriman, while the Silver can just be bought from a merchant.

Design: Goggle Techniques
Accessories: Power Goggles
Materials: Bronze x1, Crystal Ball x1, 400 gil
Effect: Focus Attack Range +20
Well, the Lilties are not ready to swim or fly fighter planes, but this 
accessory can really help them. With the Goggles on their eyes, the Lilties 
will be able to see further away from them. Therefore, as they love to 
use physical attacks so much, they have the ability to have a longer Focus 
Attack Range. Very nice for those people who would like to perform Sneak 
Attacks with Lilties. But for some strange reason, you are required to 
use an alloy to make the goggles. You will need one chunk of bronze, as 
well as a single Crystal Ball this time. My guess is that the Crystal Ball 
will be cut in half and each half will be used to fit the lenses of the 
goggles. As simple as that.

Design: Lion Soul
Accessory: Lion's Heart
Materials: Ruby x1, Cerberus Fang x1, 800 gil
Effect: Focus Attack +1
The Lilties were once brave warriors, but now, since the Iron in the Mine 
of Carthiges is exhausted, they no longer have as much ambition as before. 
Well, this accessory can help them become braver than before. With the 
Lion's Heart Equipped, the Lilty can become as courageous as the lions. 
Therefore, their focus attack power can be slightly increased. This 
accessory is not too difficult to craft, as the Ruby can be bought from 
a merchant in Leuda, while the Cerberus Fang can be found on a well, Cerberus. 
I find this accessory to be more worth it than the one below. You will 
see why when I introduce it to you.

Design: Dragon Soul
Accessory: Dragon's Heart
Materials: Dragon's Fang x1, Ruby x2, Orc Belt x1, 2000 gil
Effect: Focus Attack +3
With this accessory in their hand, or maybe heart, the Lilty will become 
even braver than the lion, and will become as brave as a dragon. Therefore, 
their focus attack power is increased by 3 points, instead of just one. 
However, this is only the bright side of things. The dark side is that 
it is just very difficult to craft. I know, the Rubies are very common, 
but for the Dragon's Fang, your Lilty must beat the Dragon Zombie in Conall 
Curach with a super high score, and hope that it will appear in the item 
selection screen. The same thing goes for the Orc Belt, as you will have 
to fight the Orc King in the Mine of Carthuiges and hope that it appears. 
If you would waste your time to get this accessory, I would wish you the 
best of luck, my gaming pal.

*****ACCESSORIES FOR YUKES*****
Design: Wisdom Tome
Accessory: Wisdom Charm
Materials: Needle x1, Coeurl's Whisker x1, 400 gil
Effect: Casting Time -10
That's more like it. The Yukes also have an accessory that deals with their 
wisdom. With this in hand, a Yuke can cast spells even faster than before. 
The design for this accessory is very common, and can be found quite often 
in Goblin Wall. However, the materials are a different story. In order 
to get the Needle, you must again, take a ship to Leuda and enter Lynari 
Desert. Then, find a Cactuar, defeat him and get the loot. You may hope 
to be sold one of these by the caravan of the Fields of Fum or the caravan 
of Leuda. As for the Coeurl's Whisker, it's found on, a well, a Coeurl.

Design: Fiend Kit
Accessory: Daemon's Earring
Materials: Silver x1, Fiend's Claw x1, 400 gil
Effect: Status Change Effects +30
Yes, they actually got the nerve to name the accessory after the notorious 
Mailer-Daemon, the address that deals with rejected e-mails on ISPs. The 
Fiend Kit is used to design the Daemon's Earring, an accessory for Yukes. 
Yes, Silver is very easy to find, but the Fiend's Claw is another story, 
you will again, will have to take a long boat trip to Leuda, and buy it 
from the female merchant there. How annoying. As for the effect it has 
on your player, it raises the status change effects on your character by 
60, which means that whenever you cast a spell on an enemy that induces 
a Status Ailment, it will be affected for longer. This is good especially 
on Fire, then they can be burnt for a long time, allowing for more extra 
powered hits.

Design: Eyewear Techniques
Accessory: Twisted Spectacles
Materials: Silver x1, Crystal Ball x2, 400 gil
Effect: Spell Range +20
Now, since when are all the Yukes short sighted as well? Why would they 
ever need to wear spectacles? Besides, how can the spectacles fit on the 
Yuke with his/her helm on? Well, I guess these spectacles are not to deal 
with eye defects, but are there to help enhance your vision. For one thing, 
your Yuke will be able to see further away, and hence they can be casting 
spells at a longer range than before. The Silver is used to make the frame, 
the Crystal Balls are to make the lenses. Crystal Balls can be bought from 
a merchant in Leuda. It is entirely up to decide whether it is worth it 
to craft such glasses.

Design: Magic Tome
Accessory: Wizard's Soul
Materials: Jade x1, Coeurl's Whisker x1, 800 gil
Effect: Spell Damage +1
This accessory sounds a bit disgusting indeed. After all, how can a Yuke 
wear the soul of a wizard? Better perform an exorcism. However, having 
the soul of a wizard inside your already magic enabled Yuke does work 
wonders. For one thing, their spell damage can be slightly increased, by 
one unit, to be precise. This is only good for those people who like to 
use spells in combat, but not good for those brawlers, but since Yukes 
are all magicians anyway, what the heck! The Jade can be bought from the 
merchant in Leuda, while the Coeurl's Whisker can be found on a Coeurl, 
it seems that the Coeurl's Whisker is used to craft a lot of magic related 
accessories recently. I wonder...

Design: Sorcery Tome
Accessory: Bishop's Soul
Materials: Jade x2, Cursed Crook x1, 2000 gil
Effect: Magic Power +3
This accessory sounds just as disgusting as the accessory mentioned above. 
After all, having the soul of a wizard is one thing, but having the soul 
of a Bishop is another thing. Yes, this accessory is so holy that your 
magic enabled Yuke can work more wonders than before. Their Magic Power 
can be increased by an increment of 3. Again, it is only good for those 
people who like to use spells in combat, but not good for those brawlers, 
but since Yukes are all magicians anyway, what the heck! The materials 
are another story. To get the Cursed Crook, you must beat the Gblin King 
in Goblin Wall with a high score as mentioned above in the walkthroughs. 
Now, finding rare materials for accessories is just impractical. Therefore, 
I do not recommend you crafting this unless you just happen to run upon 
the Cursed Crook.

Design: Forbidden Tome
Accessory: Elemental's Soul 
Materials: Dweomer Spore x1, Etheral Orb x1, Malboro Seed x1, 5000 gil
Effect: Spell Damage +5
Oh, you have touched the Forbidden Tome, you will never see the light, 
of day! No, this is not the Disney movie Aladdin, but this accessory has 
a good reason to have a design that is called Forbidden Tome. For one thing, 
this elemental's soul can cause your magically enabled Yuke to become super 
powerful when the usage of magic is concerned. After all, there is a great 
increment of 5 when Spell Damage is concerned, now your Yukes can cause 
great damage when casting spells. But is it worth it, I don't think so. 
The big downside of this accessory is that it is expensive, and in order 
to craft it, you must find 3 different spoils from 3 different bosses in 
the game. The Dweomer Spore from Armstrong, the Etheral Orb from the Lich 
and the Malboro Seed from the Malboro! Even if you get high scores in those 
level, you still may not be able to choose them! The horror of it all! 
But if you DO happen to run upon one, well, choose it, you may not be able 
to choose them for a long time!

*****ACCESSORIES FOR SELKIES*****
Design: Speed Tome
Accessory: Speed Charm
Materials: Needle x1, Giga's Claw x1, 400 gil
Effect: Focus Attack Charge Time -5
Selkies are the masters of speed. They have specially designed accessories 
to boost their speed even more. Their Focus Attack charges the fastest 
among the 4 tribes already. But now, there is yet another upgrade that 
allows them to charge it up even faster. It is the Speed Charm. The Speed 
Charm requires a Needle and a Gigas Claw. To get the Needle, once again, 
you will have to send your character all the far to the faraway land of 
Lynari Desert, find a Cactuar and kill him for the Needle. As for the Gigas 
Claw, you can enter Selepation Cave and kill a Gigas for his claw. This 
is a cheap accessory, and it's worth your time to craft it.

Design: Angel Kit
Accessory: Angel's Earring
Materials: Silver x1, Angel's Tear x1, 1200 gil
Effect: Resist Status Changes +60
This is another accessory that is easy to craft for the Selkies. This time, 
you can wear the earring that used to belong to an angel. Only joking! 
This means that, whenever a Selkie suffers from a status ailment like burns, 
curse, poison and others, he/she will lose the ailment much quicker than 
before. Is that clear? This is particularly helpful when you are in a 
situation that you are affected by a status ailment, and that there are 
so many enemies surrounding you that you cannot cast Clear on yourself, 
then this earring may save your life. Yes, you may think that the Angel's 
Tear can only found in the heavens, but hey no! All you need to do is to 
kill an Ahriman and he will drop one!

Design: Designer Goggles
Accessory: Eagle Goggles
Materials: Iron x1, Crystal Ball x1, Griffin's Wing x1, 1200 gil
Effect: Focus Attack Range +20
It seems that all tribes have their own eyewear, even though they are not 
all born to be shortsighted. Anyway, these Eagle Goggles are not an 
exception, they improve your Selkies' sight. Therefore, you can see further 
away, and can have a longer focus attack range, which is good for all those 
Selkie snipers out there. These goggles have an Iron frame, and they will 
split a Crystal Ball in half to make the lens. Then, as it is a pair of 
Eagle Goggles, some bird references, provided by the Griffin's Wing are 
needed. Let's just hope these iron goggles won't rust in the rain...

Design: Speed Secrets
Accessory: Speed Talisman
Materials: Needle x1, Zu's Beak x1, 1200 gil
Effect: Focus Attack Charge Time -10
Selkies are the masters of speed. They have specially designed accessories 
to boost their speed even more. Their Focus Attack charges the fastest 
among the 4 tribes already. But now, there is yet another upgrade that 
allows them to charge it up even faster than the Speed Charm. It is the 
Speed Talisman. The Speed Talisman requires a Needle and a Zu's Beak. To 
get the Needle, once again, you will have to send your character all the 
far to the faraway land of Lynari Desert, find a Cactuar and kill him for 
the Needle. As for the Zu's Beak, go and hang around the desert, find a 
Zu, kill him, and let's hope that he will drop a Zu's Beak to you. This 
is a cheap accessory, and it's worth your time to craft it.

Design: Brigandology
Accessory: Thief's Emblem
Materials: Wind Crystal x1, Orc Belt x1, Green Sphere x1, 5000 gil
Effect: Focus Attack Charge Time -15
Kids, what are Selkies the best at? (Whole class replies loudly) Thieves! 
That's right! Selkies are the masters of speed. They have specially 
designed accessories to boost their speed even more. This is particularly 
true that many of them used to be thieves. Their Focus Attack charges the 
fastest among the 4 tribes already. But now, there is yet another upgrade 
that allows them to charge it up even faster than the Speed Talisman. It 
is the Thief's Emblem. Now, the Thief's Emblem is also very difficult to 
craft. It requires 3 materials from 3 bosses, the Wind Crystal from the 
Cave Worm, the Orc Belt from the Orc King and the Green Sphere from the 
Golem. IT will be a tremendous waste of time to go after them just for 
the material. You will be better off if you bump into those by chance.

----------------------------
c. Enemies and Bosses [A2C]
----------------------------
Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles taunts a large number of enemies. There 
are so many enemies that are found in different places. Some have been 
seen in Final Fantasy IX, like the Sahagin. I included a mini-enemy list 
in the strategy guides for each level, but here is the master enemy list 
of the game. No, I will not include the Boss List, at least not yet.

Goblin:
HP: 30, 37, 45
Found in: River Belle Path, Goblin Wall
Attacks: 
Blade Slash (Blade Goblins only)
Spear Sweep (Goblin Spearmen only)
Mace Pound (Mace Wielding Goblins only)
Rock Throw (All Goblins)
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Lightning, Slow
The Goblins are the most common enemies found in River Belle Path, they 
have different weapons in hand. Some carry daggers, some carry spears and 
some carry maces. The goblins with daggers have 30 HP, the ones with spears 
have 37, and the ones with maces have 45. The daggers cannot stun your 
character, but the spears and maces can. Be aware of the spears, as they 
have a wide sweeping angle. All rocks can stun your character, although 
they are not very accurate. In spite of the vulnerabilities they have, 
using normal physical attacks will do in this case.

Dark Hedgehog:
Found in: River Belle Path, Mushroom Forest
HP: 37
Attacks:
Charging Tackle
Acrobatic Ground Slamming Shock Wave Attack
Curse
Vulnerabilities: Holy
Resistance: All attacks when invisible
This really is a sonic hedgehog look alike sort of a monster. These guys 
are invisible at first, and they are translucent. As they are invisible, 
all attacks can only take one HP off them when used. Therefore, it really 
can be very annoying at times. The Dark Hedgehog will tackle your character 
most of the time, resulting in no knockback at all. However, when the Dark 
Hedgehog starts showing off his acrobatic skills, you really should be 
prepared to run out of the way, as when it makes the whooshing sound and 
lands, the shock wave can stun you, and has a considerable area effect. 
Don't let them put a curse on you! Fortunately, these guys can be revealed 
by a Holy spell, once cast on them, they will become visible, and you can 
make them suffer for sure!

Griffin:
Found in: River Belle Path, Veo Lu Sluice
HP: 80
Attacks:
Airborne Jump Ballistic Attack
Ground Stomp Shock Wave Attack
Forward Wing Attack
Vulnerability: Fire
Useful Item: Griffin's Wing
This is just a giant bird that seems to be cross bred with a ground animal. 
Although this enemy is a bird, it cannot fly at all. Instead, it is grounded 
at all times. Most of the time, if you stand still and are far away from 
him, the Griffin will make a cry and then soar up into the air, and fire 
a single energy ball at you while airborne, before landing again. If you 
get close to the Griffin, he can attempt to charge you down by stomping 
the ground, creating a shockwave, or by simply hitting you with his wings. 
The former attack can stun you enemy, so be careful. A good idea would 
be to weaken him with a single Fire Spell. That way, you can hurt him more 
per hit. Once he is killed, he may drop his wing (Griffin's Wing), and 
you can take it with you, and use it to craft accessories.

Stone Hedgehog:
Found in: River Belle Path, Mushroom Forest
HP: 20
Attacks:
Charging Tackle
Acrobatic Ground Slamming Shock Wave Attack
Vulnerabilities: Gravity (once only)
Resistance: All spells
This really is a sonic hedgehog look alike sort of a monster. These guys 
are made of stone, and are really rock hard in the defense department. 
As they are rocky, all attacks can only take one HP off them when used. 
Therefore, it really can be very annoying at times. The Stone Hedgehog 
will tackle your character most of the time, resulting in no knockback 
at all. However, when the Stone Hedgehog starts showing off his acrobatic 
skills, you really should be prepared to run out of the way, as when it 
makes the whooshing sound and lands, the shock wave can stun you, and has 
a considerable area effect. Fortunately, these guys' HP can be halved by 
a single Gravity Spell, and then, you can just hit him 10 more times to 
kill them. What a job.

Mu
Found in: River Belle Path
HP: 25
Attacks:
Claw Swipe
Tail Whip
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Cold, Slow
These are just some squirrel that would barrow out of the ground to get 
at you. When you see dirt rising up from the ground and some cracking sound, 
you can tell that a Mu is coming out to annoy you. These guys are pretty 
much of an annoyance to your character. They will only swipe you with their 
claws, or sometimes will do a loop the loop and hit you with their tail. 
The Tail Whip in particular has a knock back force, and can stun your 
character. So, be careful of that. Otherwise, it won't be that troublesome 
to get rid of them at all, no spells are needed, just physical attacks.

Goblin Mage:
Found in: River Belle Path, Goblin Wall, Mt. Kilanda
HP: 30
Attacks:
Fire
Thunder
Blizzard
Blizzaga
Slow
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Lightning, Slow
These are the mages of the Goblin Army. They can be distinguished by their 
darker color and their magic staff. They are the artillery of the goblins. 
While you are busy fighting the enemies in the front, the Goblin Mage will 
simply target you from the rear and cause damage to you at that critical 
moment. The most threatening of his attacks are the Blizzaga. It has the 
same targeting ring as the Blizzard, and has a wider area effect. Therefore, 
whenever you notice your character standing on a targeting ring, move out 
of the way immediately, and the mage will miss. Once they are alone, Goblin 
Mages are pretty helpless. You can just run into the and kill them with 
ease at that point.

Goblin Chieftain:
Found in: River Belle Path, Goblin Wall
HP: 60
Attacks: 
Blade Slash
Rock Throw
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Lightning, Slow
These are of the higher ranks of the Goblin Army. The Goblin Chieftains 
are larger and stronger than the normal Goblins, and they do more damage 
in their attacks. Besides, they usually cannot be knocked back by your 
attacks. Therefore, if you stats are low, you should hit and run to whittle 
down his health slowly and steadily. Otherwise, consider lowering their 
defense with Fire, or stunning them for a while with Thunder. The same 
rules of engagement apply for Goblin Chieftains as those to the standard 
issue Goblins.

Flan:
Found in: Goblin Wall, Conall Curach
HP: 25 (Goblin Wall), 50 (Conall Curach)
Attacks:
Headbutt
Yellow Slowness Gas (Slows you down)
Vulnerability: Fire
No, these are not those tasty pastries that are a lot like quiches. But, 
there are some blob of yellow goo that writhes like quicksilver on the 
ground. They are just another of those annoyances you will find in Goblin 
Wall. They attack by headbutting you with their goop. They also may attempt 
to slow you down by blowing some yellow gas out. Otherwise, you can just 
kill them with a couple of hits of your weapon. There is no need to use 
Fire at all, unless you want to waste your time.

Bat:
Found in: Goblin Wall, Mine of Carthiges
HP: 15
Attacks:
Headbutt
Vulnerability: All attacks when grounded
Resistance: All attacks when airborne
This is yet another pestilence in this level. Bats in this game flutter 
around, headbutting your characters as they go. If you attempt to hit them 
while they are flying, regardless of how hard you try, they can still only 
lose one HP per hit. However, it is another story if you have grounded 
them with gravity. Then, they will become much more vulnerable, and can 
be taken out with a couple of hits with you weapon. 

Cerberus: 
Found in: Goblin Wall, Rebena Te Ra
HP: 80
Attacks:
Claw Swipe
Claw Swipe with Energy Ball
Fire Blast (Burns)
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Slow, Paralysis
Useful Item: Cerberus Fang
No, these aren't those zombified hellhounds from the Resident Evil series. 
Instead, they are some sort of a large dog, with two tails and one head, 
instead of the three heads. These large enemies pack a punch. Most of the 
time, they will release a large energy ball with their claw swipe, that 
does great damage and at a range. If you are at close quarters, he will 
just swipe you, and this also deals a lot of damage to you. However, the 
Cerberus is particularly exposed when he performs his fire blast attack. 
Avoid the blast, and you can get a few hits in while he is blowing the 
fire out. It takes quite a long time for him to move again, and that's 
when you move in. Blizzard is also effective on him, and you can perform 
Blizzard or Thunder on him repeatedly to keep him immobile, although this 
can take some time if your magic stats are low. A Cerberus may drop a Cerberus 
Fang when he dies, and you can use it to forge a Valiant Weapon or the 
Lion's Heart accessory.

Ghost: 
Found in: Goblin Wall, Conall Curach, Rebena Te Ra
HP: 50
Attacks: 
Flap Bash
A one, and a two and an Ice Wave (Freezes)
Vulnerabilities: Holy
Resistance: All attacks when invisible, Cold
Useful Item: White Silk
Oh, what scary looking creatures you are. The ghosts of Final Fantasy 
Crystal Chronicles look like some flour sack with two red eyes, and two 
ribbon like flaps attached to the body. They also boost some powerful 
attacks. The Flap Bash is not that bad, but the Ice Wave is decimating. 
This must be the Ghost's close quarter defense. Whenever you see a Ghost 
pausing and moving their flaps up and down in a one, and a two and a three 
rhythm, get away from the ghost, as he will slam it down once more and 
release an Ice Wave which deals great damage and can freeze you in your 
own tracks. As they are invisible, they are so resistant that any hit will 
deal only one HP of damage to them. Therefore, you must reveal them with 
Holy, and then you can really make them pay for what they have done.

Electric Jellyfish:
Found in: Goblin Wall, Selepation Cave
HP: 30
Attacks:
Headbutt
Thunder
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Slow
Resistance: Lightning
Useful Item: Thunderball
This is just one of the silliest enemies that Square-Enix can think of, 
after all, what kind of Jellyfish can float in air and have electricity? 
The Electric Jellyfish are yet another annoying enemy in this level. They 
can float over and headbutt you, stunning you for a short time. When you 
are far away, they can cast Thunder on you. Besides, you cannot hit these 
pests directly, or you will get an electric shock. (Protect yourself with 
Wind Element or a Thunder Badge) I would therefore recommend using Blizzard 
or Fire on them, or just use Focus Attacks that are ballistic in nature. 
Electric Jellyfish tend to carry Thunderballs with them, and they can be 
used to forge Lightning Armor and Thunder Badges, which help your character 
to resist lightning based attacks.

Gremlin:
Found in: Mushroom Forest, Tida
HP: 30
Attack:
Hair Ball Smack
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Slow, Paralysis
No, these are not those tiny little fuzzy creatures that cannot stand water. 
The Gremlin is a rather common enemy in Mushroom Forest, but they are not 
much of a threat still. Their only attack, the hair ball attack, does not 
deal too much damage but it has a knockback effect, so you will get stunned 
for a short moment when hit. Gremlins are vulnerable to cold, slow and 
paralysis, therefore, you can always use Blizzard or Thunder on them. Their 
hair ball attack can be spotted as he leans his head backwards. Then, you 
can move out of the way as it so slow and inaccurate. In spite of his 
vulnerabilities, a couple of hits from your weapon should be sufficient 
to kill there little pests.

Hell Plant:
Found in: Mushroom Forest, Tida
HP: 30
Attack:
Energy Ball Spit
Poison Gas (Poisons)
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Slow, Paralysis
The Hell Plant is another common enemy found in Mushroom Forest, Tida, 
Conall Curach, and many other places. It's amazing that plants can make 
such cries. Most of the time, they attack from a range, by spitting out 
energy balls at you. They make a very distinguishable sound while doing 
so, therefore, it would not be very hard to anticipate and evade their 
attack. Most of the time, Hell Plants will use this attack. But sometimes, 
they can let out poison gas from their mouth which poisons you, of course. 
This attack is also easily detectable, as once they are preparing to unleash 
poison gas, they will always stop attacking for a moment and act as if 
they are holding their breath. You should get out of the way for the time 
being until their have finished releasing the gas. The Hell Plants are 
vulnerable to fire and lightning, but I don't think you will need spells 
to take these stationary enemies down.

Stone Plant:
Found in: Mushroom Forest: Tida
HP: 20
Attack:
Energy Ball Spit
Poison Gas (Poisons)
Vulnerability: Gravity (Only once)
Resistance: All attacks
The Stone Plant is basically a beefed up version of the Hell Plant. But 
still, why would plants be made of stone? I guess Square-Enix must have 
become rather too creative nowadays. Like the Hell Plants, the Stone Plants 
attack from a range, by spitting out energy balls at you. They make a very 
distinguishable sound while doing so, therefore, it would not be very hard 
to anticipate and evade their attack. But if it hits, it deals more damage 
than that of the Hell Plant. Most of the time, Stone Plants will use this 
attack. But sometimes, they can let out poison gas from their mouth which 
poisons you, of course. This attack is also easily detectable, as once 
they are preparing to unleash poison gas, they will always stop attacking 
for a moment and act as if they are holding their breath. You should get 
out of the way for the time being until their have finished releasing the 
gas. I know, Stone Plants are weak against gravity, so use it to sap half 
of its HP before you start to bash them.

Ahriman:
Found in: Mushroom Forest
HP: 25
Attack:
Flying Tackle
Random Blue Beam (Slows you down)
Thunder
Vulnerability: Gravity
Resistance: All attacks when in the air
The Ahriman is a yellow colored flying enemy, with wings that resemble 
those of pteradactyls. There really is no head on these flying enemies. 
Instead, there is a body, with an eye in the middle. The Ahrimans usually 
will not attack you when you are far away from them. Instead, they will 
just randomly zap a blue beam around, that is so random that it is hard 
to avoid. If you get hit, you will not receive damage, only that you will 
be slowed down to a crawl. Sometimes, they may attempt to cast Thunder 
on you, but that is easy to avoid once you see the targeting ring on the 
ground. When you are up close, Ahrimans will just tackle you in the air. 
As he is flying, you should bring him down with Gravity to immobilize him, 
then feel free to slash him to death.

Ice Ahriman: (Multiplayer games only)
Found in: Mushroom Forest
HP: 25
Attack:
Flying Tackle
Random Blue Beam (Slows you down)
Blizzard
Vulnerability: Gravity
Resistance: All attacks when in the air, Cold
Useful Item: Chilly Gel
The Ahriman is a green colored flying enemy, with wings that resemble those 
of pteradactyls. There really is no head on these flying enemies. Instead, 
there is a body, with an eye in the middle. The Ice Ahrimans, like the 
normal Ahrimans usually will not attack you when you are far away from 
them. Instead, they will just randomly zap a blue beam around, that is 
so random that it is hard to avoid. If you get hit, you will not receive 
damage, only that you will be slowed down to a crawl. Sometimes, they may 
attempt to cast Blizzard on you, but that is easy to avoid once you see 
the targeting ring on the ground. When you are up close, Ice Ahrimans will 
just tackle you in the air. As he is flying, you should bring him down 
with Gravity to immobilize him, then feel free to slash him to death. Once 
you beat him, an Ice Ahriman may drop Chilly Gel, which can be used to 
craft Frost Armor and Frost Badges.

Ochu:
Found in: Mushroom Forest, Moschet Manor
HP: 100
Attacks:
Double Vine Slam
Rapid Spin
Poison Spell (Poisons)
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Slow, Paralysis
Ochus are some sort of plant being with a big mouth and some pink petals 
around. These plant beings, unlike the Hell Plant, are not stationary, 
they can move around to wreck havoc on you. Their high HP makes them 
particularly troublesome. Fortunately these enemies do not have any decent 
ranged attacks. Ochus can only cast poison spells on you. Once you see 
the green targeting ring on the ground, move away and you will be safe 
from poisoning. However, do not let Ochus get too close to you. When you 
are close enough, Ochus can swing their long vine like arms out and slam 
you between them. Or, they can just be a bit aerobic and spin around, 
knocking you back. As Ochus are plants, they are particularly vulnerable 
to fire. So, casting a Fire spell on them to weaken them is not a bad idea 
at all. If in doubt, use projectile focus attacks to keep your distance 
from this oversized plant being.

Tiny Worm:
Found in: Mushroom Forest
HP: 30
Attack:
Tackle
Vulnerability: Fire
Resistance: Lightning
Tiny worms are actually the young versions of the Carrion Worm. They are 
mainly green in colour and they make a hissing sound. These worms are small 
and usually cannot deal too much damage on you. They rely on running over 
to you and tackling you, and that is all. As they have such a low HP, killing 
them will not be a big difficulty for you. Tiny worms are vulnerable to 
fire, but are resistant to lightning, as their older version, the Carrior 
Worm can cast Thunder. Casting Fira is a good way to eliminate several 
Tiny Worms that are bunched up together at once. Let them burn.

Carrion Worm:
Found in: Mushroom Forest, Tida
HP: 60
Attack:
Tackle
Poison Gas Slam (Poisons)
Thunder
Vulnerability: Fire
Resistance: Lightning
Useful Item: Worm Antenna
Carrion Worms are the adult version of the . They are mainly green in colour, 
with a reddish brown antenna and they make a hissing sound. These worms 
are small and usually cannot deal too much damage on you. They rely on 
running over to you and tackling you, and that is all. These guys are quite 
a challenge, as they have twice the amount of HP as the carrion worms. 
Carrion Worms can cast Thunder on you, as well as poisoning you with gas. 
You can tell they are preparing to let out the gas when they lean their 
body back. At that time, run back! Tiny worms are vulnerable to fire, but 
are resistant to lightning, as  the Carrior Worm can cast Thunder. Casting 
Fira is a good way to eliminate several Tiny Worms and Carrion Worms that 
are bunched up together at once. Let them burn. Exterminate them. By the 
way, Carrion Worms may leave their Worm Antenna for you to pick up. The 
Worm Antenna can be used to make Time Armor and Accurate Watches.

Hedgehog Pie:
Found in: Mushroom Forest
HP: 30
Attacks:
Charging Tackle
Acrobatic Ground Slamming Shock Wave Attack
Fire
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Lightning, Slow
Now, this is not a pie made from a hedgehog. It is actually another of 
those sonic the hedgehog look alike monsters. Hedgehog Pies are just the 
plain version of the Hedgehogs, with no resistance to anything. The 
Hedgehog Pie will tackle your character most of the time, resulting in 
no knockback at all. However, when the Hedgehog Pie starts showing off 
his acrobatic skills, you really should be prepared to run out of the way, 
as when it makes the whooshing sound and lands, the shock wave can stun 
you, and has a considerable area effect. Hedgehog Pies can also cast Fire 
in attempt to burn you. But still, there is a considerable delay before 
he releases the attack, so you will be safe. Use that time to run into 
it and start bashing it to death.

Magic Plant:
Found in: Mushroom Forest, Tida, Conall Curach
HP: 30
Attacks:
Energy Ball Spit
Fire
Thunder
Blizzard
Slow
The Magic Plant is a new type of Hell Plant. Hell Plants are bluish green 
in colour with brightly coloured "wings". It's amazing that plants can 
make such cries. Most of the time, they attack from a range, by spitting 
out energy balls at you. They make a very distinguishable sound while doing 
so, therefore, it would not be very hard to anticipate and evade their 
attack. Most of the time, Hell Plants will use this attack. However, the 
meat of this plant are its magic attacks. All magic attacks are given out 
in a very short delay, which means that by the time you see the targeting 
ring beneath your character's feet, it would be too later. Therefore, you 
must be fast on your feet and use hit and run tactics to outwit this super 
fast plant like creature.

Orc:
Found in: Mine of Carthuiges
HP: 40, 50
Attacks:
Double Bit Axe Chop (Double Bit Axe Wielding Orcs)
Spear Smash (Orc Spearmen)
Large Mace Slam (Mace Wielding Orcs)
Shield Bash
Running Rugby Tackle
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Slow, Paralysis
Yes, those nasty beings are back from the Lord of the Rings. The Orc is 
the dominant character of the Mine of Carthuiges. There are just everywhere. 
There are just like to the Mine of Carthuiges as the Goblins are to the 
Goblin Wall. Orcs are armed with different weapons. Orcs can either have 
a double Bbit axe (An Axe with blades on either side of the handle), a 
spear, or a giant mace that they can use to smash down on your character. 
The spear and the mace can knock your character down and stun them. So, 
be aware of this. Sometimes, Orcs can just ambush you out of nowhere. They 
run at you, and will dive down onto the ground at you at the last moment, 
similar to the Rugby Tackle. This move is difficult to stop even if you 
can anticipate. Your best bet would be to run back the instant he dives. 
Besides, each Orc is equipped with a shield. When fighting in close quarters, 
an Orc may just swing their shield out and knock you back. Or they may 
just hold their shield up to guard against any attacks you may pull on 
them. They are the most vulnerable when in the latter pose, as you can 
run around behind him and deliver maybe 3 to 4 hits before they move again. 
Orcs are rather easy to detect, they some times may hold their shield up 
in the air, while laughing in a charismatic tone, and that's when you know 
an Orc is nearby, and has seen you.

Fire Bomb:
Found in: Mine of Carthuiges, Tida
HP: 30
Attacks:
Airborne Tackle
Fire
Meteor Strike
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Lightning
Resistance: Fire
Useful Items: Magma Rock, Flame Craft, Design for Flame Armor
The Fire Bomb is well, some sort of black sphere like creature with flames 
as hair, and two pairs of evil looking eyes. These enemies are nothing 
but an annoyance, and usually will not pose too much of a threat to you. 
When you are up close to them, they may just swing back and attempt to 
ram into your character. The Fire Bomb knows two different spells. They 
can cast Fire on your character, or even worse, perform a Meteor Strike 
on you! The Meteor Strike is denoted by a pinkish red coloured targeting 
ring with a black circle in the center. When the attack is released, a 
large meteor will drop down from the sky, and onto the targeting ring. 
This move works indoors as well. The meteor strike can do considerable 
damage to your character. Fortunately it has a long delay, and you can 
easily run away from the ring long before the meteor is released upon thee. 
Although the Fire Bomb is vulnerable to cold and lightning, normal physical 
attacks will do. Although the Fire Bomb may be hard to hit while it is 
casting a spell, as it will float rather high up. Once a Fire Bomb is 
destroyed, it will self destruct, burning any enemies or you that appear 
to come too close. You can take advantage of this and destroy a Fire Bomb 
in the middle of a group of enemies and let them all take damage at once. 
Just get out of the proximity before the explosion. Once a Fire Bomb dies, 
it may drop a magma rock, a flame craft or a design for flame armor. Therefore, 
if you are after anti-flame protection devices, you should always go after 
those Fire Bombs.

Orc Mage:
Found in: Mine of Carthuiges
HP: 40
Attacks:
Fire
Thunder
Blizzard
Slow
Curse
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Slow, Paralysis
The Orc Mage is just the mage of the Orc Army. There are just like the 
Goblin Mages to the Goblins. An Orc Mage can be spotted by their distinctive 
darker color than the standard issue Orcs, as well as their magic staff. 
An Orc Mage will just cast the usual 4 spells on you all the time. Just 
let him aim at you. Then run at him and then you can bash him to death. 
Is this clear? But be aware of situations where the Orc Mage will be shielded 
by his fellow Orc Soldiers. Then, you would be in a tougher predicament.

Cockatrice:
Found in: Mine of Carthuiges, Selepation Cave
HP: 45
Attacks:
Energy Ball Attack
Slow
Poison Gas (Poisons)
Petrifying Peck (Petrifies)
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Slow, Paralysis
Useful Item: Cockatrice Scale
It is amazing that the word Cockatrice is actually included in the 
programming of Microsoft Word. A Cockatrice is some sort of a ground based 
bird with blue green scales, a beak and wings with a purple edge. These 
enemies do have quite a good defense to withstand physical attacks. There 
are lots of ways for Cockatrices to attack you. When you are far away, 
a Cockatrice will fire an energy ball at you, or they may fold their wings 
in front of themselves and cast Slow on you to slow you down. At close 
quarters, a Cockatrice may peck you with its beak, and will turn you into 
stone while doing so. It may also wind back and let out a gust of green 
poison gas that poisons you if you are close. As Cockatrices are vulnerable 
to fire, you should try to cast Fire once on them to weaken their defenses 
before moving in with your physical attacks. Otherwise, Cockatrices alone 
cannot deal too much damage to you itself. Sometimes, Cockatrices may drop 
Cockatrice Scales for you to collect. It can be used to craft a Gold Necklace 
or to forge Gold Armlets for Lilties.

Ogre:
Found in: Mine of Carthuiges, Mt. Kilanda
HP: 120
Attacks:
Giant Punch
Hammer Attack
Hammer Ground Slam Shock Wave
Vulnerability: Lightning
Useful Item: Ogre Fang
The Ogres of Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles look like some kind of 
oversized walrus with grey armor and a giant hammer in their hands. They 
are really tough, with their 120 HP, and they really can pack a punch. 
All of his attacks can knock your character down, and his Hammer Ground 
Slam Shock Wave will send a very large shock wave that covers a very wide 
radius. Therefore, whenever you see an Ogre slowly raising his hammer 
behind the back of his head, be prepared to run very far away, or you will 
be caught in the shockwave. As the Ogres are so tough, it is not a good 
idea to get into a brawl with them. Therefore, you should always try to 
shock him for a short while with a Thunder spell, and he will be rendered 
temporarily immobile. Whenever you see the Ogre begin to get up, quickly 
cast another Thunder spell to keep him down. Eventually he will be killed. 
When an Ogre dies, he may drop an Ogre Fang, which can be used to craft 
the victorious weapon for all 4 tribes.

Ice Bomb:
Found in: Mine of Carthuiges, Veo Lu Sluice, Conall Curach
HP: 37
Attacks:
Airborne Tackle
Blizzard
Meteor Strike
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Lightning
Resistance: Cold
Useful Items: Chilly Gel, Frost Craft, Design for Frost Armor
The Ice Bomb is well, some sort of black sphere like creature with blue 
fumes as hair, and two pairs of evil looking eyes. These enemies are nothing 
but an annoyance, and usually will not pose too much of a threat to you. 
When you are up close to them, they may just swing back and attempt to 
ram into your character. The Ice Bomb knows two different spells. They 
can cast Blizzard on your character, or even worse, perform a Meteor Strike 
on you! The Meteor Strike is denoted by a pinkish red coloured targeting 
ring with a black circle in the center. When the attack is released, a 
large meteor will drop down from the sky, and onto the targeting ring. 
This move works indoors as well. The meteor strike can do considerable 
damage to your character. Fortunately it has a long delay, and you can 
easily run away from the ring long before the meteor is released upon thee. 
Although the Ice Bomb is vulnerable to cold and lightning, normal physical 
attacks will do. The Ice Bomb may be hard to hit while it is casting a 
spell, as it will float rather high up. Once an Ice Bomb is destroyed, 
it will self destruct, freezing any enemies or you that appear to come 
too close. You can take advantage of this and destroy an Ice Bomb in the 
middle of a group of enemies and let them all take damage at once. Just 
get out of the proximity before the explosion. Once an Ice Bomb dies, it 
may drop a blob of Chilly Gel, a frost craft or a design for frost armor. 
Therefore, if you are after anti-cold protection devices, you should always 
go after those Ice Bombs.

Thunder Bomb:
Found in: Mine of Carthuiges, Conall Curach
HP: 37
Attacks:
Airborne Tackle
Thunder
Meteor Strike
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Cold
Resistance: Lightning
Useful Items: Thunderball, Lightning Craft, Design for Lightning Armor
The Thunder Bomb is well, some sort of black sphere like creature with 
purple fumes as hair, and two pairs of evil looking eyes with electric 
bolts all over it. These enemies are nothing but an annoyance, and usually 
will not pose too much of a threat to you. When you are up close to them, 
they may just swing back and attempt to ram into your character. The Thunder 
Bomb knows two different spells. They can cast Thunder on your character, 
or even worse, perform a Meteor Strike on you! The Meteor Strike is denoted 
by a pinkish red coloured targeting ring with a black circle in the center. 
When the attack is released, a large meteor will drop down from the sky, 
and onto the targeting ring. This move works indoors as well. The meteor 
strike can do considerable damage to your character. Fortunately it has 
a long delay, and you can easily run away from the ring long before the 
meteor is released upon thee. Although the Thunder Bomb is vulnerable to 
cold and lightning, normal physical attacks will do. The Thunder Bomb may 
be hard to hit while it is casting a spell, as it will float rather high 
up. Once a Thunder Bomb is destroyed, it will self destruct, shocking any 
enemies or you that appear to come too close. You can take advantage of 
this and destroy a Thunder Bomb in the middle of a group of enemies and 
let them all take damage at once. Just get out of the proximity before 
the explosion. Once a Thunder Bomb dies, it may drop a Thunderball, a 
Lighting craft or a design for lightning armor. Therefore, if you are after 
anti-lightning protection devices, you should always go after those 
Thunder Bombs.

Wraith:
Found in: Mine of Carthuiges, Daemon's Court
HP: 50
Attacks:
Blue Staff Poke
Slow
Vulnerabilities: Holy
Resistance: All attacks when invisible
Wraiths are some invisible beings which look like mages with brown pointed 
hats holding a blue staff. Although the Wraith has only one attack, that 
attack is not to be underestimated. The Blue Staff Poke can deal quite 
a lot of damage to anything that it hits. The Wraith is quite tough, not 
only it has a high HP, it is invisible. Therefore, you must reveal these 
enemies with a single Holy spell before you can even think about attacking 
him. The Wraiths are particularly vulnerable when they are casting Slow, 
due to their long delay. Only move in then.

Lizardman
Found in: Selepation Cave, Veo Lu Sluice
HP: 37
Attacks: 
Dagger Slash (Dagger Wielding Lizardmen)
Mace Bash (Mace Wielding Lizardmen)
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Slow, Paralysis
Well, this is what you get when you cross Lizards with men, Lizardmen! 
The Lizardmen of the Selepation Cave are green in colour, and they make 
hissing sounds of lizards, and they all wear a grey suit of armor, and 
has spines like those of Stegosauruses. There are two types of Lizardmen 
here. There are ones which carry a dagger with them, and will chop you 
with them, there are others who carry a mace with 4 spikes, and will bash 
you hard, and stunning you at the same time. The latter type are more 
dangerous than the former type. Fortunately, all Lizardmen are vulnerable 
to cold, which means you can always surprise them from behind by a well 
placed Blizzara or Blizzaga, and then they can suffer the pain. Hit and 
run tactics also work fine against these freaks, as they can only attack 
in close quarters with their blunt objects.

Lizardman Mage:
Found in: Selepation Cave, Veo Lu Sluice
HP: 37
Attacks: 
Fire
Fira
Thunder
Blizzard
Slow
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Slow, Paralysis
The Lizardman Mages are just Lizardmen, but they are trained with the 
ability to cast spells, while the standard Lizardmen are there for close 
quarters combat. Lizardman Mages, like the normal Lizardmen are green in 
the Selepation Cave. They are harder to distinguish than the Lizardman, 
as they really have not many differences in appearance. The only difference 
is that they carry a magic staff with them. The Lizardman Mage casts quite 
a lot of spells. He casts all the conventional spell, as well as the powerful 
Fira move. The Fira spell has a wider radius and can hit you multiple times, 
so beware. Otherwise, you can just let him aim at you, and then you can 
run at the Lizardman during the long delay and waste him. Yes, regardless 
of what monsters they are, all the mages are pretty vulnerable on their 
own, when no front line soldiers are supporting them.

Killer Bee:
Found in: Selepation Cave: Daemon's Court
HP: 15
Attack:
Air Tackle
Vulnerability: Gravity
Resistance: All attacks when airborne
The Killer Bee is yet another tiny little creepy crawly that can prove 
to be just as an annoyance to those Bats around. They are golden yellow 
in colour, they have white wings and a very long stinger. Fortunately these 
guys do not sting you. Instead, they will just ram into you with their 
air tackles. Although this does little damage, it can knock your character 
back, which is rather annoying at times. Like all other flying enemies, 
they are very resistant to all attacks while they are flying. Therefore, 
you can always use a single Gravity Spell to bring them down onto the ground 
before you start bashing them silly.

Blazer Beetle:
Found in: Selepation Cave, Mt. Kilanda.
HP: 80
Attacks:
Double Claw Slash
Horn Drill
Vulnerabilities: All Magic Spells
No, this is no new model of the Volkswagen Beetle. This is just another 
giant insect enemy of Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles. Blazer Beetles 
are well, just like Beetles. They have a black shell, which is very hard, 
and he has a very long horn with a pointed tip. His two forelegs are razor 
sharp. A Blazer Beetle does not know any spells. Therefore, he can only 
rely on some close quarters combat, which is very damaging to your character, 
First, a Blazer Beetle can swipe you twice with both of his claws, he can 
also use his sharp horn to drill into your character. The latter attack 
is easily detectable and hence avoidable. If you see the Blazer Beetle 
moving his body back and some red and yellow light on his horn, then you 
can tell that he is about to hit you with that move. Don't ever get hit, 
not only you will be knocked back, you will receive quite heavy damage. 
As Blazer Beetles have so much HP, I would suggest you exploit his weakness. 
You should either freeze it or paralyze it. Then you can land in quite 
a number of free hits before it can retaliate. Whenever Blazer Beetles 
die, they may drop Hard Shells, which can be used to forge diamond armor.

Lizard Skirmisher (Green):
Found in: Selepation Cave, Veo Lu Sluice
HP: 37
Attacks: 
Spear Throw
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Slow, Paralysis
Do you know what a Skirmisher is? A skirmisher is a soldier in the army 
that throws spears at the enemy. They are often used with archers in battle. 
The Lizard Skirmishers are just the type of Lizardman who is always holding 
a spear in their hands. The Lizard Skirmishers in the Selepation Cave are 
green in colour, much like their infantry counterparts. Of course, Lizard 
Skirmishers always attack by throwing spears at you. The spears definitely 
have a much longer range than the close combat weapons of the other 
Lizardmen. Most of the time, Lizardman Skirmishers do not work alone. They 
are often teamed up with other Lizardmen. Whenever a whole group attacks, 
the Lizard Skirmishers often stay behind the ranks to throw their spears 
at you while the Lizardmen cover them. This makes the Skirmishers very 
annoying enemies. But once the vanguard is destroyed, the Lizard 
Skirmishers are rather helpless. All it takes is some hit and running to 
bring these lizard artillery units down.

Lizard Captain:
Found in: Selepation Cave
HP: 37
Attacks:
Dagger Slash (Dagger Wielding Lizard Captains)
Curse
Vulnerabilities: Slow, Paralysis
I have just figured out, that many armies of enemies in the game are quite 
analogous to each other. The Goblins have the normal Goblin, the Goblin 
Mage and the Goblin Chieftain. The Lizards on the other hand, have the 
Lizardmen, the Lizard Mage, the Lizard Skirmishers and the Lizard Captain. 
The Lizard Captain is well, analogous to the Goblin Chieftain. The Lizard 
Captain is actually a giant Lizardman. Like the lower ranked Lizardmen, 
Lizard Captains are green in colour. Most of the time, the Lizardman Captain 
will simply slash you with his larger dagger, dealing more damage than 
the typical Lizardman. However, he is quite dangerous when you are far 
away from him. Instead of running after you, the Lizard Captain will attempt 
to put a Curse on your character, halving their stats before moving in. 
Therefore, the element of surprise is the most important when you have 
to face these giant monsters. Although Lizard Captains are resistant to 
Blizzards, they can still be frozen in by Blizzara or Blizzaga. This is 
how you can ambush them from a range.

Sonic Bat:
Found in: Selepation Cave, Rebena Te Ra
HP: 15
Attacks:
Headbutt
Supersonic Pulse
Vulnerability: All attacks when grounded
Resistance: All attacks when airborne
This is yet another pestilence in this level. Sonic Bats are an enhanced 
version of the Bat, they appear blue-green in colour. Besides headbutting 
your character, it can launch some supersonic pulses at you, which can 
stun you momentarily, giving you a headache. If you attempt to hit them 
while they are flying, regardless of how hard you try, they can still only 
lose one HP per hit. However, it is another story if you have grounded 
them with gravity. Then, they will become much more vulnerable, and can 
be taken out with a couple of hits with you weapon. 

Gigas:
Found in: Selepation Cave
HP: 150
Attacks:
Giant Punch
Ice Breath (Freezes)
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Slow
Resistance: Cold
Useful Item: Gigas Claw
Gigas look like a rip off version of the beast in Disney's Beauty and the 
Beast, of come sort. They have the same sort of grin as the Beast, and 
they have a blue upper body and brown legs. Gigas do pack a punch. In fact, 
he can use his giant fists to giant punch you most of the time. This deals 
considerable damage and has the ability to knock your character back, 
stunning him/her for a short while. A Gigas can also exhale some Ice Breath 
at you. Of course, it can freeze the victim on contact. In spite of the 
heavy attack power it possesses, a Gigas is quite slow, as he has to use 
hit arms to propel himself forwards after you. He may have 120 HP, but 
he can be weakened using a Fire spell. Just do not try to use a Blizzard 
spell on him as it just will not work against him. (Probably due to him 
being able to use his Ice Breath) Hit and run tactics also work well against 
a Gigas. When a Gigas is killed, he may drop a Gigas Claw, which may be 
used to craft the Charm of Speed, an accessory for Selkies.

Sahagin:
Found in: Selepation Cave, Conall Curach
HP: 45
Attacks:
Claw Swipe
Blue Breath Attack
Ice Spike Jab (Freezes)
Blizzard
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Slow, Paralysis
The Sahagin is a blue-green coloured water creature that lives in many 
damp areas like the Selepation Cave and Conall Curach. They like to live 
in water, and when enemies (that's you), come close by, they will just 
out of the water to ambush them. This action is not hard to detect. You 
can hear the splash as the Sahagin jumps out of the water. The Sahagin 
is a decent fighter both in close range and long range. At close quarters, 
a Sahagin can just swipe you with its claws. When you are at medium range, 
a Sahagin will blow some blue breath to you that causes moderate damage. 
He can also stick out an ice spike from one of its claws and jab you with 
it. This attack has the ability to freeze any unsuspecting character in. 
Finally, a Sahagin can also cast Blizzard on you. A Sahagin has quite a 
high defense, and is resistant to many physical attacks. However, it is 
vulnerable towards Fire, and that's all you need to weaken them before 
moving in and brawl with them.

Lizard Soldier
Found in: Daemon's Court
HP: 45
Attacks: 
Dagger Slash (Dagger Wielding Lizardmen)
Mace Bash (Mace Wielding Lizardmen)
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Slow, Paralysis
Well, this is what you get when you cross Lizards with men, Lizardmen! 
The Lizard Soldiers of the Daemon's Court are black in colour, and they 
make hissing sounds of lizards, and they all wear a grey suit of armor, 
and has spines like those of Stegosauruses. There are two types of Lizard 
Soldiers here. There are ones which carry a dagger with them, and will 
chop you with them, there are others who carry a mace with 4 spikes, and 
will bash you hard, and stunning you at the same time. The latter type 
are more dangerous than the former type. Fortunately, all Lizard Soldiers 
are vulnerable to cold, which means you can always surprise them from behind 
by a well placed Blizzara or Blizzaga, and then they can suffer the pain. 
Hit and run tactics also work fine against these freaks, as they can only 
attack in close quarters with their blunt objects. Lizard Soldiers have 
8 more HP than the Lizardmen, maybe because these are soldiers, while those 
are just mercenaries, hired hands!

Lizard Wizard:
Found in: Daemon's Court
HP: 45
Attacks: 
Fire
Fira
Thunder
Blizzard
Slow
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Slow, Paralysis
The Lizard Wizard are just Lizardmen, but they are trained with the ability 
to cast spells, while the standard Lizardmen are there for close quarters 
combat. Lizard Wizards, like the normal Lizardmen are black in the Daemon's 
Court. They are harder to distinguish than the Lizardman, as they really 
have not many differences in appearance. The only difference is that they 
carry a magic staff with them. Lizard Wizards have 8 more Hp than the 
Lizardman Mage. The Lizard Wizard (boy, their name really is catchy, the 
two words rhyme!) casts quite a lot of spells. He casts all the conventional 
spells, as well as the powerful Fira move. The Fira spell has a wider radius 
and can hit you multiple times, so beware. Otherwise, you can just let 
him aim at you, and then you can run at the Lizardman during the long delay 
and waste him. Yes, regardless of what monsters they are, all the mages 
are pretty vulnerable on their own, when no front line soldiers are 
supporting them.

Lizard Skirmisher (Black):
Found in: Daemon's Court
HP: 37
Attacks: 
Spear Throw
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Slow, Paralysis
Do you know what a Skirmisher is? A skirmisher is a soldier in the army 
that throws spears at the enemy. They are often used with archers in battle. 
The Lizard Skirmishers are just the type of Lizardman who is always holding 
a spear in their hands. The Lizard Skirmishers in the Daemon's Court are 
black in colour, much like their infantry counterparts. Of course, Lizard 
Skirmishers always attack by throwing spears at you. The spears definitely 
have a much longer range than the close combat weapons of the other 
Lizardmen. Most of the time, Lizardman Skirmishers do not work alone. They 
are often teamed up with other Lizardmen. Whenever a whole group attacks, 
the Lizard Skirmishers often stay behind the ranks to throw their spears 
at you while the Lizardmen cover them. This makes the Skirmishers very 
annoying enemies. But once the vanguard is destroyed, the Lizard 
Skirmishers are rather helpless. All it takes is some hit and running to 
bring these lizard artillery units down.

Lizard Warrior:
Found in: Daemon's Court
HP: 75
Attacks:
Mace Bash 
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Slow, Paralysis
I have just figured out, that many armies of enemies in the game are quite 
analogous to each other. The Goblins have the normal Goblin, the Goblin 
Mage and the Goblin Chieftain. The Lizards on the other hand, have the 
Lizardmen, the Lizard Mage, the Lizard Skirmishers and the Lizard Captain. 
The Lizard Warrior is well, analogous to the Goblin Chieftain. The Lizard 
Captain is actually a giant Lizardman. Like the lower ranked Lizardmen, 
Lizard Warriors are black in colour. Most of the time, the Lizardman Warrior 
will simply bash you with his mace, knocking you back, dealing more damage 
than the typical Lizardman. This time, the Lizard Warriors of Daemon Court 
cannot cast Curses on your characters, and hence you can be much safer 
in taking them out from a distance. Therefore, the element of surprise 
is the most important when you have to face these giant monsters. The Lizard 
Warriors are vulnerable to cold, which means blizzard is a good choice, 
they can also be frozen in by Blizzara or Blizzaga. This is how you can 
ambush them from a range.

Coeurl:
Found in: Daemon's Court, Moschet Manor
HP: 50
Attacks:
Claw Swipe
Whisker Slam
Fire
Thunder
Thundara
Blizzard
Slow
Resistance: Gravity
Useful Item: Coeurl Whisker
The Coeurl is some kind of a dog with two long whiskers on its face, and 
a long tail. The Coeurl is yellow in colour and makes the sounds that a 
dog makes. Is that clear? At close range, a Coeurl will simply resort to 
physical attacks, where he can swipe you with his claws as well as slam 
you with his whiskers. The latter attack can knock your character back. 
This is not all, the Coeurl is actually a dog that can cast lots of different 
spells. It can cast Fire, Thunder, Thundara, Blizzard and Slow. The 
Thundara is quite troublesome at times, but all magic spells are easy to 
avoid. Whenever it is casting those spells, the Coeurls will suffer from 
a very long delay. That is when they are especially vulnerable. Although 
Coeurls are resistant to gravity, no one will bother to use it anyway, 
so there is nothing to worry about. The Coeurl cannot suffer from status 
ailments, regardless of what spell you choose. Therefore, physical attacks 
are the most effective against these dogs with whiskers. When a Coeurl 
dies, it may leave behind its whisker, which can be used to craft the 
Wizard's Soul, Charm of Wisdom and the Rune Shield.

Skeleton Mage
Found in: Tida, Rebena Te Ra
HP: 37
Attacks:
Fire
Thunder
Blizzard
Slow
Curse
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Slow, Paralysis
Skeleton Mages, are well, Skeletons who are mages, in other words, they 
are some skeletons that are trained to cast magic on you. The Skeleton 
Mages are different in appearance from the normal skeletons in the respect 
that they are orange in colour, and they hold a very characteristic magic 
staff, instead of the swords, spears and axes of the normal Skeletons. 
Although the golden rule of magicians in this game is to stay behind the 
soldiers for protection, the Skeleton Mages of Tida seem to work alone 
all the time. Most of the time, you will find them hanging around the place, 
by themselves, unsupported by anyone. This makes them easy targets. Like 
most of the mages, Skeleton Mages like to cast the usual assortment of 
spells, like Fire, Thunder, Blizzard and Slow. However, Skeleton Mages 
can sometimes curse you, halving you stats. Otherwise, these bony mages 
are no match for you. Just watch them fall apart when they die.

Skeleton:
Found in: Tida, Rebena Te Ra
HP: 37
Attacks: 
Weapon Bash
Heavy Weapon Bash
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Cold, Paralysis
Useful Item: Gear
The Skeletons are just well, skeletons, all of them carry a weapon and 
a shield with them to combat. Basically all skeletons like to make use 
of the element of surprise to get you. You will see piles of bones on the 
floor, and then, when you get close, you see them swirl around in a cloud 
and then fuse together to form a skeleton. Then, you will know that they 
are activated when you hear the characteristic ding sound. Skeletons use 
a wide range of weapons. Some use a sword, some use some kind of a pike 
while others will use a battle axe. They will just hit you with their weapon 
most of the time. However, sometimes, they can jump up into the air, and 
deliver a critical hit to you. You can tell as their weapons become red 
while they are doing so, and that is when you should run off. Sometimes, 
the skeletons will go into a defensive stance, and just hold their shield 
up. You can take the time to score a couple of free hits at their backs. 
When they die, Skeletons will be shattered to many pieces, and may leave 
behind a gear, which can be used to craft an Accurate Watch of an Unfaltering 
Watch. Maybe it is because these skeletons are mechanical.

Abbadon:
Found in: Tida, Conall Curach
HP: 80
Attacks:
Airborne Double Claw Slash
Supercharged Energy Blast
Curse
Vulnerabilities: Gravity
Resistance: All attacks when airborne
Useful Item: Jagged Scythe
Abbadons are another tough airborne enemy. They look like some giant green 
bug with a few pairs of red wings. Abbadons, being the giant bug that they 
are, tends to pack a punch with both of their attacks, as they are just 
so large! Firstly, the Abbadon can slash you with its gigantic scythes. 
This causes lots of damage, and can be super destructive. Secondly, the 
Abbadon can charge up a large blast of energy and launch it towards the 
ground. This is just as devastating than the former attack. However, the 
latter attack is easier to avoid than the former. Whenever you hear the 
Abbadon's charging sound, you should just run out of the way. The best 
approach will be to cast Gravity to bring him down, right? Unfortunately, 
this is not always a good idea for an Abbadon can also cast a Curse on 
your character, and while he/she is cured, the first two attacks can kill 
him/her in only one hit! I wish you the best of luck in defeating these 
monsters. However, with victory comes the spoils. The Abbadons may 
sometimes drop their Jagger Scythe for your use. It can be used to forge 
the Mighty Weapon.

Gargoyle:
Found in: Moschet Manor, Rebena Te Ra
HP: 12
Attacks:
Air Tackle
Fire Blast (Burns)
Electric Blast (Shocks)
Ice Blast (Freezes)
Vulnerability: Gravity
Resistance: All Attacks
Someone must have been to the Notre Dame in Paris and stole all their 
monuments there. The Gargoyles are just enemies that stand on their little 
stands in this level. Whenever your character comes close, they will come 
to life and come after you. Most of the time, the Gargoyles will fire a 
blast of fire, electricity or ice at you from a distance. If you go get 
close enough, they can just tackle you with their wings. Of course, 
Gargoyles are statues, and statues are made of stone. This makes them rather 
tough nuts to crack. As they are made of stone, they are resistant towards 
all attacks, with the exception of gravity. Even so, each physical attack 
you perform on it will deal only 1 HP of damage. Fortunately, they only 
have 12 HP, so 12 hits will be all you need to bring these statues down.

Tonberry Chef:
Found in: Moschet Manor
HP: 37
Attack:
Knife Chop
Supercharged Knife Chop
Slow
Useful Item: Yellow Feather
Tonberry Chefs are those cooks you see in the opening cut-scene. You can 
easy spot them with their cook's hat. The Tonberry Chefs are always armed 
with choppers. Whenever they spot intruders, they will come over to chop 
you with the chopper. At the same time, they may just super charge the 
move and make a devastating chop. Fortunately, that attack is easily 
detectable and you can get a few free hits in while they are delayed for 
a long time. Once a Tonberry Chef is killed, he will drop a yellow feather, 
which can be used to forge the Chocobo Shield!

Water Flan:
Found in: Veo Lu Sluice
HP: 35
Attacks:
Headbutt
Blue Slowness Gas (Slows you down)
Vulnerability: Fire
Resistance: Cold
No, these are not those tasty pastries that are a lot like quiches. But, 
there are some blob of blue goo that writhes like quicksilver on the ground. 
They are just another of those annoyances you will find in Veo Lu Sluice. 
They attack by headbutting you with their goop. They also may attempt to 
slow you down by blowing some blue gas out. Otherwise, you can just kill 
them with a couple of hits of your weapon. There is no need to use Fire 
at all, unless you want to waste your time. Of course, Water Flans are 
made of water, unlike the ordinary type. Therefore, they are resistant 
to Cold. When they die, they may drop Chilly Gel, which can be used to 
forge Frost Armor and the Frost Badge.

Gigan Toad:
Found in: Veo Lu Sluice, Conall Curach
HP: 60 (Veo Lu Sluice), 80 (Conall Curach)
Attacks:
Tongue Jab
Blizzard
Blizzara
Vulnerability: Fire
Resistance: Cold
Useful Item: Toad Oil
Gigan Toads are well, giant blue-green amphibians that like to dwell in 
damp environments like Veo Lu Sluice and Conall Curach. They have a blue 
green back with a clear belly. As a water creature, Gigan Toads love to 
use Ice attacks against you. Therefore, a Gigan Toad as the ability to 
use two different kinds of Blizzard Spell. They are Blizzard and Blizzara. 
Both moves share the same targeting ring, with Blizzara having a wider 
radius than Blizzard. It is always better to be safe than sorry, and run 
considerably away from the ring to avoid the area effects. Of course, Gigan 
Toads are not only capable of long range combat. They are also quite good 
at close quarters. If your character is beating them badly up close, they 
will stick out their tongues to jab you. This does considerable damage 
and is capable of knocking your character back. This is detected by the 
toad leaning back and opening its mouth. Then you can take evasive action. 
Gigan Toads are tougher in Conall Curach. There, you must exploit their 
weakness with fire spells. When a Gigan Toad dies, he may drop a vial of 
Toad Oil, which can be used to craft Eternal Armor and Unfaltering Watches, 
accessories and armor that protects your character from ever being put 
on stasis. As the Conall Curach is a later level, Gigan Toads het 20 more 
HP than those in Veo Lu Sluice. They are more resistant to physical attacks 
too. This makes exploiting their weaknesses here a high priority.

Snow Mu
Found in: Conall Curach
HP: 45
Attacks:
Claw Swipe
Tail Whip
Vulnerabilities: Fire, Slow
Resistance: Cold
These are just some squirrel that would barrow out of the ground to get 
at you. What makes them different from the normal Mus is that they are 
white in colour, more like skunks, and that they bear the Water Element, 
and hence are resistant to Cold attacks like Blizzard. When you see dirt 
rising up from the ground and some cracking sound, you can tell that a 
Mu is coming out to annoy you. These guys are pretty much of an annoyance 
to your character. They will only swipe you with their claws, or sometimes 
will do a loop the loop and hit you with their tail. The Tail Whip in 
particular has a knock back force, and can stun your character. So, be 
careful of that. Otherwise, it won't be that troublesome to get rid of 
them at all, no spells are needed, just physical attacks, but still they 
are slightly tougher than the Mus as Conall Curach is one of the "later 
levels" of Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles.

Sahagin Lord:
Found in: Conall Curach
HP: 75
Attacks:
Claw Swipe
Blue Breath Attack
Ice Spike Jab (Freezes)
Blizzara
Vulnerabilities: Slow, Paralysis
Useful Item: Pressed Flower, Remedy
The Sahagin Lord is well, the Lord of all the Sahagins. There is only one 
in Conall Curach. Unlike the other Sahagins, the Sahagin Lord will not 
jump out of the ground. They will just stand there and wait for others 
approaching him. The Sahagin Lord is a decent fighter both in close range 
and long range. At close quarters, the Sahagin Lord can just swipe you 
with its claws. When you are at medium range, the Sahagin Lord ill blow 
some blue breath to you that causes moderate damage. He can also stick 
out an ice spike from one of its claws and jab you with it. This attack 
has the ability to freeze any unsuspecting character in. Finally, the 
Sahagin Lord can also cast Blizzara on you, he's the Lord of the Sahagins, 
after all. The Sahagin Lord has quite a high defense, and is resistant 
to many physical attacks. Unlike his weaker lower level Sahagins, he is 
also resistant to fire, you may consider stopping him before attacking.

Stone Sahagin:
Found in: Conall Curach
HP: 20
Attacks:
Claw Swipe
Blue Breath Attack
Ice Spike Jab (Freezes)
Blizzard
Vulnerability: Gravity
Resistance: All Attacks
As if the normal Sahagins aren't enough, we now have Sahagins that are 
made of stone. They like to live in the ground, and when enemies (that's 
you), come close by, they will just out of the ground to ambush them. This 
action is not hard to detect. You can hear the sound as the Sahagin jumps 
out of the water. The Stone Sahagin is a decent fighter both in close range 
and long range. At close quarters, a Stone Sahagin can just swipe you with 
its claws. When you are at medium range, a Stone Sahagin will blow some 
blue breath to you that causes moderate damage. He can also stick out an 
ice spike from one of its claws and jab you with it. This attack has the 
ability to freeze any unsuspecting character in. Finally, a Sahagin can 
also cast Blizzard on you. Fortunately a Stone Sahagin only has 20 HP, 
then you can cast Gravity, then slaughter them in 10 hits.

Behemoth:
Found in: Conall Curach
HP: 180
Atttacks:
Giant Kick
Taser Horn (Shocks)
Fire Tail Whip (Burns)
Ice Tail Whip (Freezes)
Vulnerabilities: Most Magic Attacks
Useful Items: Orichalcum, Diamond Ore
You know what a behemoth is, don't you. There are really gigantic monsters 
that reside in Conall Curach only. They are big purple like creasures that 
walk on four legs. They have these two black horns on their heads that 
can give out electric charges, much like those tasers people use to suppress 
rioters. They can also kick you hard on the ground. Whenever you see its 
tail glow, you should run. This is because, it it glows with a red colour, 
it is going to unleash a firestorm on the areas around it. If it's blue, 
there will be an ice wave. Your best bet will be to strike as far as possible, 
weakening it with magic, Thundara works best as it can never move, and 
focus on sniper attacks with Focus Attacks. Once they die, their loot is 
really worth it. You can get a chunk of Orichalcum or maybe a bag of Diamond 
Ore, both are required to produce powerful weapons and armor.

Mimic:
Found in: Rebena Te Ra
HP: 50
Attack:
Tackle
Fire
Thunder
Blizzard
Resistance: All Magic
Mimics are well, mimics of our very own favorite treasure chests. They 
first resemble a real treasure chest, and when you open it, it will spring 
into life! Surprised eh? Foruntately, all it can do is to tackle you while 
you are in the air, and therefore, will not pose a big threat to you.

Nightmare:
Found in: Rebena Te Ra
HP: 75
Attack:
Light Kick
Dual Leg Trample
Fire Shot (Burns)
Thunder Shot (Shocks)
Ice Shot (Freezes)
Vulnerability: Holy
Resistance: All Attacks when invisible
What do you get when you have an invisible horse with burning blue hair? 
That's right, a nightmare. Nightmares are invisible enemies that are 
residents of Rebena Te Ra. Like most horses, Nightmares do have rather 
damaging kicks. They may also attempt to trample you at close range. At 
long ranges, Nightmares can fire projectiles at your character. They can 
fire a shot of Fire at you which burns, a shot of Thunder which gives your 
character an electric shock, and an Ice Shot, which freezes. As simple 
as that. The most dangerous thing about the Nightmares is that they have 
such a high HP value, and yet is invisible. Therefore, use Holy to reveal 
them for a start, and then you can go and slaughter this, or I should say, 
go and flog a dead horse!

Lava Ahriman:
Found in: Mt. Kilanda
HP: 50
Attack:
Flying Tackle
Random Blue Beam (Slows you down)
Fire
Vulnerability: Gravity
Resistance: All attacks when in the air, Fire
Useful Item: Magma Rock
The Lava Ahriman is a red colored flying enemy, with wings that resemble 
those of pteradactyls. There really is no head on these flying enemies. 
Instead, there is a body, with an eye in the middle. The Lava Ahrimans, 
like the normal Ahrimans usually will not attack you when you are far away 
from them. Instead, they will just randomly zap a blue beam around, that 
is so random that it is hard to avoid. If you get hit, you will not receive 
damage, only that you will be slowed down to a crawl. Sometimes, they may 
attempt to cast Fire on you, but that is easy to avoid once you see the 
targeting ring on the ground. When you are up close, Lava Ahrimans will 
just tackle you in the air. As he is flying, you should bring him down 
with Gravity to immobilize him, then feel free to slash him to death. Once 
you beat him, an Ice Ahriman may drop Magma Rock, which can be used to 
craft Flame Armor and Flame Badges.

Lava Mu
Found in: Mt. Kilanda
HP: 45
Attacks:
Claw Swipe
Tail Whip
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Slow
Resistance: Fire
These are just some squirrel that would barrow out of the ground to get 
at you. What makes them different from the normal Mus is that they are 
red in colour, and that they bear the Fire Element, and hence are resistant 
to Fire attacks like Fire. When you see dirt rising up from the ground 
and some cracking sound, you can tell that a Lava Mu is coming out to annoy 
you. These guys are pretty much of an annoyance to your character. They 
will only swipe you with their claws, or sometimes will do a loop the loop 
and hit you with their tail. The Tail Whip in particular has a knock back 
force, and can stun your character. So, be careful of that. Otherwise, 
it won't be that troublesome to get rid of them at all, no spells are needed, 
just physical attacks, but still they are slightly tougher than the Mus 
as Mt. Kilanda is one of the "later levels" of Final Fantasy: Crystal 
Chronicles.

Lamia:
Found in: Mt. Kilanda, Lynari Desert
HP: 37
Attacks:
Claw Swipe
Slow
Stop
Vulnerability: Cold
Remember Maggie of the Moschet Manor, she is a gigantic version of a Lamia. 
Now, you can get to see these miniature versions of her right here in hot 
stages like Mt. Kilanda and Lynari Desert. Like Maggie, all Lamias are 
just an annoyance. They rarely damage you. Instead, they just use moves 
which stop time against use. They can use Slow and Stop all the time. Only 
at close quarters will Lamias use their Claw Swipe. Therefore, they really 
are not hard to defeat, unless there are other enemies covering them. What 
sissies. Lamias are vulnerable to Cold, and hence Blizzard can deal a lot 
of damage to them. It is important for your characters to exploit this 
weakness, as Lamias are quite resistant to normal physical attacks.

Scorpion:
Found in: Lynari Desert
HP: 37
Attacks:
Poison Sting (Poisons)
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Slow, Paralysis
Well, this is just as expected in any desert level. After all, the desert 
is home to Scorpions. What's so different about these Scorpions do not 
have just one poisonous sting, they have two! They can sting enemies in 
front of and behind them at the same time. Scorpions like to ambush their 
prey by jumping out of the sand. Therefore, be careful, and when you hear 
the sound of sand shifting, get onto the stand guard stance, and watch 
out. The good thing is, that Scorpions, being the desert creatures and 
all, cannot stand cold. Therefore, the first thing in the agenda is to 
use Blizzard or Blizzara and freeze the foe. Then, they can take more damage 
than when you decide to brawl with them with physical weapons. Don't do 
that, as they are rather resistant. 

Rock Scorpion:
Found in: Lynari Desert
HP: 15
Attack:
Poison Sting (Poisons)
Vulnerability: Gravity
Resistance: All attacks
Well, this is just as expected in any desert level. After all, the desert 
is home to Scorpions. What's so different about these Scorpions do not 
have just one poisonous sting, they have two! They can sting enemies in 
front of and behind them at the same time. Besides, some live in the land 
so much that they absorb minerals into their bodies and turn into stone! 
Scorpions like to ambush their prey by jumping out of the sand. Therefore, 
be careful, and when you hear the sound of sand shifting, get onto the 
stand guard stance, and watch out. Of course, as these enhanced Scorpions 
are made of stone, no spells but Gravity can cut it. Therefore, you should 
half its HP by Gravity, then bash it about 8 times to defeat it.

Zu
Found in: Lynari Desert
HP: 120
Attacks:
Air Swoop
High Energy Blast
Fire Shot (Burns)
Electric Shot (Shocks)
Ice Shot (Freezes)
Vulnerability: Gravity
Resistance: All attacks when flying
Useful Items: Zu's Beak, Orichalcum
This looks like somekind of a giant prehistoric bird with one gigantic 
delta wing. Much like most of those modern fighters today, like a modern 
divebomber, the Zu likes to perform an air swoop down onto their prey, 
much like those Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers. Watch out as the Zu seems to 
be winding up, as it can deliever an unholy amount of damage to your 
character. Another attack is its High Energy Blast, where the Zu will simply 
let out a large and thick beam of energy onto your charcter, again it deals 
similar damage to that of the Abbadon. At the same time, the Zu can fire 
shots of Fire, Electricity and Ice onto your enemy. This is just as easy 
to attack as those similar attacks used by the Gargoyles. The good thing 
about the Zu is that, like the Abbadon, it can be forced to "sit on the 
ground" while you hit using Gravity. That way, you can beat these large 
behemoths of the air with little resistance. Zus tend to drop either Zu's 
Beaks or chunks of Orichalcum when killed. The Zu's Beaks can be used to 
craft the Speed Talisman of those Selkies.

Cactuar:
Found in: Lynari Desert
HP: 37
Attacks:
Jump Kick
Needle Storm
Thunder
Vulnerability: Fire
Resistance: Lightning
Useful Item: Needle
Cactuars are just well, some cacti that have been brought to life by some 
evil force and have gone bad, unlike all the good cacti that sit around. 
These guys are very agile and very playful. They like to run over to your 
character and perform jump kicks on your character very rapidly, and while 
they are at it, they will cry "Woo-hoo!" Much like Mario when he does his 
double jump! The good thing is, this attack is not very accurate. If you 
see a Cactuar repeatedly attempting to kick you but miss continuously, 
then you will know that you will be safe if you just stand still. On the 
other hand, the Cactuar has his share of long range attacks too. He can 
sometimes bend down, making a cranking sound, and launch a whole bunch 
of needles at your character. They can also cast Thunder on your character, 
and it is very fast. As Cactuars are plants, they are vulnerable to Fire, 
so use Fire and burn the life out of these evil cacti! When they die, they 
may drop Needles, which can be used to craft a large variety of accessories.

Sand Sahagin:
Found in: Lyanri Desert
HP: 45
Attacks:
Claw Swipe
Blue Breath Attack
Ice Spike Jab (Freezes)
Blizzard
Vulnerabilities: Cold, Slow, Paralysis
The Sahagin is a blue-green coloured water creature that lives in many 
damp areas like the Selepation Cave and Conall Curach. ON the other hand, 
the Sahagin has a lot of relatives. Like the Stone Sahagin, and the Sand 
Sahagin that are the residents of Lynari Desert. The Sand Sahagins are 
coated with Silicon(IV) oxide, and they live in the sand, and jump out 
and ambush your character. This action is not hard to detect. You can hear 
the crackling sound as the Sand Sahagin jumps out of the sand. The Sand 
Sahagin is a decent fighter both in close range and long range. At close 
quarters, a Sand Sahagin can just swipe you with its claws. When you are 
at medium range, a Sahagin will blow some blue breath to you that causes 
moderate damage. He can also stick out an ice spike from one of its claws 
and jab you with it. This attack has the ability to freeze any unsuspecting 
character in. Finally, a Sand Sahagin can also cast Blizzard on you. A 
Sahagin has quite a high defense, and is resistant to many physical attacks. 
However, it is vulnerable towards Cold, and that's all you need to weaken 
them before moving in and brawl with them. Well, many enemies in Lynari 
Desert are vulnerable to Cold. This has become a popular trend.

Chimera:
Found in: Lynari Desert, Mount Vellenge
HP: 120 (Lynari Desert), 48 (Mount Vellenge)
Attacks:
Horn Drill
Snout Spin Bash
Electric Shockwave (Shocks)
Fire Breath (Burns)
Ice Breath (Freezes)
Vulnerabilities: Slow, Paralysis
Useful Item: Chimera's Horn, Design for Legendary Weapon
No, these aren't those evil bug like creatures Chris and Jill will find 
in the Power Area of Resident Evil. The Chimeras of Final Fantasy: Crystal 
Chronicles are some giant yellow creature with two sharp horns, and they 
all have a rather long snout. First off, the Chimera can just use its horn 
to drill into your characters. They also can swing their snout around for 
360 degrees in order to hit enemies all around it. The Chimera's horn can 
be used as a pair of electrode to generate electricity. When you see there 
are electric bolts between the two horns, you had better run, as the 
electric shockwave has a wide radius. The snout can give out fiery air 
and cold air, which burns and freezes your opponents respectively. The 
Chimera is not very vulnerable to magic, so your best bet would be to cast 
Stop on them to put them in stasis before you start to bash the life out 
of them. When they die, Chimeras tend to drop Chimera's Horns and sometimes, 
the design for the Legendary Weapon. Its horn can be used to forge the 
Dragoon's Spear, Twisted Scope and the Talisman of Wisdom.

Shade:
Found in: Mount Vellenge
HP: 25
Attacks:
Club Bash
Slow
Curse
Vulnerability: Holy
Resistance: All attacks when invisible
Shades are some kind of evil woodman who is invisible, and is a resident 
of Mount Vellenge. If you have raised your character to what I recommend 
however, their attacks are not really a big threat to you. The one and 
only physical attack that a Shade can perform with you is his club bash, 
where he bashes your character with a stick like thingy. Otherwise, he 
will just cast some spells that can result in status ailments on your 
character. The Slow is not a big problem, but curse is. Remember to reveal 
them with Holy before you start bashing them.

Death Knight:
Found in: Mount Vellenge
HP: 48
Attacks:
Sword Bash
Single Arm Punch
Dual Atm Slam
Ground Slam Shock Wave
Ice Shot (Freezes)
Vulnerabilities: Slow, Paralysis
The Death Knight is some giant infantry unit with a large sword and a skull 
on his armor. The Death Knight can attack with a wide variety of attacks. 
First off, he can just bash you with his sword. He can also punch your 
character with one of his arms, as well as slamming your character with 
both of his arms. The Death Knight can also slam the ground hard, resulting 
in a shock wave that can stun your character. Finally, he can shoot balls 
of ice on you. Fortunately, these enemies are just so frail and brittle 
in Mount Vellenge, and that brute force will be all your charcter needs 
to destroy these evil knights.

Sphere:
Found in: Mount Vellenge
HP: 18
Attacks:
Air Tackle
Poison Spell (Poisons)
Slow
Vulnerability: Gravity
Resistance: All attacks when airborne
A Sphere is well, a Sphere. They look like some UFO rejects from a sci-fi 
movie. These enemies are also relatively harmless. All they can do is to 
tackle your character from the air. When you are in range, they will just 
cast spells that can be easily avoided. Just ground these balls and bash 
them until they fall apart.

Tonberry:
Found in: Mount Vellenge
HP: 24
Attacks:
Knife Stab
Supercharged Knife Stab
Slow
Resistance: Gravity
Tonberries are like Tonberry Chefs, but without their chef's hat. You can 
easy spot them with their fishy look. The Tonberries are always armed with 
knives instead of choppers. Whenever they spot intruders, they will come 
over to stab you with the knife. At the same time, they may just super 
charge the move and make a devastating stab. Fortunately, that attack is 
easily detectable and you can get a few free hits in while they are delayed 
for a long time.

*****BOSSES*****
Boss: Giant Crab
Found in: River Belle Path
HP: 400
Attacks:
Super Electric Discharge (When HP>266)
Claw Swipe (When HP>266)
Giant Horn Slam (When HP>133)
Slow Bubble
Thundara (When HP<133)
Thundaga (When HP<133)
Resistance: Lightning
Minions: 1 Mu
Item in Possession: Ancient Sword
Recommended Equipment: Wind Element Crystal Chalice, Thunder Badge
This boss looks a lot like a cross between a Triceratops and a crab. In 
fact, he has a single Mu to back him up. It will not be very hard for your 
character to kill the Mu, then you can focus on the Giant Crab. The Giant 
Crab has 3 appearance, one with the horn and claw, one with the horn, and 
one bare-headed. 

The first appearance applies when the Giant Crab has 266 or more HP left. 
He can use his claw to charge up electricity in his horn and fire at you, 
giving you an electric shock. He can also swipe you quite accurately with 
his claw. Therefore, do not run to the left of the direction the crab is 
facing or you will be hit and knocked down. The Giant Crab can blow out 
bubbles that will lock onto your character for a while. That way, you should 
run around until it stops following your character, or else, you will be 
slowed down. The Giant Crab can slam his horn down on you. This attack 
as more range than you can imagine. It is NOT a headbutt, as the Giant 
Crab will sort of fold his horn forwards. This also can have a knock back 
effect on your player, which is not very good.

Once the Giant Crab has 266HP left, he would lose his claw, and cannot 
discharge electricity or swipe you, but he can still slam you with his 
horns. Once you damage him to 133HP, he will lose his horn as well. This 
is when things get dangerous. As he has no physical attacks left, the Giant 
Crab will resort to using Thundara and Thundaga on you. These attacks have 
a large area effect, and can easily kill you if you are slowed down. 
Therefore, do not let him use the slow bubble on you at that stage. For 
additional safety, equip a Thunder Badge with a Wind Element in your Crystal 
Chalice, then, you will can prevent yourself from suffering from electric 
shocks, and you can bash the Giant Crab freely.

Boss: Goblin King
Found in: Goblin Wall
HP: 200
Attacks:
Firaga
Thundara
Blizzara
Poison Spell
Slowga
Staff Bash
Minions: 2 Goblins 
Useful Item: Cursed Crook
Recommended Equipment: Crystal Chalice with Earth Element and Blue Misanga, 
or Crystal Chalice with Fire Element with Flame Badge
It seems that the Goblin King has placed his trust on his personal 
bodyguards. In the beginning of the battle. You will fight his two dagger 
wielding Goblins. When they are down, two Goblin Spearmen will come out 
from 2 doors, to engage you. Kill them as usual. Each Goblin Spearman holds 
a key to the 2 pedestals there. Once they are dead, they will drop the 
keys, allowing you to pick them up, and place them onto the pedestals. 
Once both keys are in place, the steps to the platform where the Goblin 
King is will be revealed, allowing you to go up to fight the Goblin King 
man to man. He still will have 2 Goblin Spearman bodyguards to help him, 
but the Goblin King himself will attack.

The Goblin King has only 200 HP, which makes him rather easy to deal with. 
However, his spells do pack a punch, and will inflict a lot of nasty status 
ailments to your player. The particularly worse ones include poison and 
burning. As they are using level 2 spells, only 1 protective equipment 
is not enough, you will need to have 2 that protects against the same 
ailments, this is why I recommended the usage of Earth Element and Blue 
Misanga, which allows for double protection against poisoning, or the usage 
of Fire Element and Flame Badge at once.

It seems that the Goblin King's minions are not very bright. When you have 
killed them, they will reappear after a short time, but will still wait 
at their respective doors until you get close. Therefore, if you kill the 
two minions and then stay away from the doors while fighting the Goblin 
King, they will not come out to help their highness. Take this in mind.

The Goblin King uses a wide range of attacks, and Slowga, by far, is the 
hardest to annoy, but however, if you can keep a close distance between 
yourself and the Goblin King, things will be very easy for you, and he 
will just bash you with your weapon while he hits you with his staff, even 
if you are slowed down. 

The Goblin King is also a master of surprises. When things go too tough, 
he will just wimpishly teleport to another part of the room. He can 
sometimes do this continuously and it's quite annoying. Stop and wait for 
him to reappear. Then run after him and bash him again.

Eventually, his HP meter would have dropped down to zero, and he will notice 
that his magic staff is malfunctioning and watches it explode in his face!  
That's the end of yet another easy battle.

Boss: Malboro
Found in: Mushroom Forest
HP: 400
Attacks:
Ground Vine Attack
Poison Gas
Curse
Slowga
Blizzaga (When HP<200)
Resistance: Cold
Minions: 2 Magic Plants, 1 Hell Plant
Useful Item: Malboro Seed (~189 points)
Recommended Equipment: Crystal Chalice with Water Element, Frost Badge
You are now up against some large plant with more than 20 eyes and such 
a large mouth. The Malboro is a big stationary enemy, which means he cannot 
go after you even if you decide to run away. His 3 minions are just as 
stationary, and they do not have much range to pit against you. However, 
they really are an annoyance when you have to go in close to fight the 
Malboro. Particularly when you notice that there is a targeting ring where 
you are standing, and by the time you realize it, it is often too late 
and the spell is cast on you. This is particularly true for all those Magic 
Plants around. They have a lot of tricks that really are annoying.

Therefore, the best course of action may be to kill the 3 plants helping 
the Malboro while constantly avoiding the Malboro's attacks. As it is the 
case of 4 against one, I would recommend you to hit and run if your stats 
are low. That is, hit this Magic Plant once, then run, hit the Hell Plant, 
run, hit the other Magic Plant. Repeat the procedures until they are all 
dead. Then you can move in to hit the Malboro before the plants reappear.

The Malboro himself has a much longer range than the Magic Plants and Hell 
Plants. When you are very far away from the Malboro, he can perform a Ground 
Vine Attack that can deal multiple hits on your character. You can tell 
when the Malboro is raising his tentacle above the ground, ready to slam 
down. Once slammed down, some spiky vines will stick out of the ground 
where your character is standing, and can hit him/her hard. Therefore, 
whenever you see Malboro raising his tentacle, be prepared to run away 
from where you are standing.

Another thing to be aware of is the Curse spell, which will half all your 
character's stats. The curse spell here is denoted by a deep purple 
targeting ring, and this has a wider radius than the standard one. This 
also has an unlimited range, which means he can hit you with this spell 
regardless of anywhere you are standing. This move, compounded with the 
Ground Vine Attack can prove to be super deadly. Therefore, if you are 
cursed, be ready to cast Clear on yourself, or it may be possible for the 
Malboro to finish you off with just one Ground Vine Attack!

Now, when you are familiar with his attacks, go up close to the Malboro. 
The Malboro will again attempt to hit you with the Ground Vine Attack. 
Otherwise, if you see the targeting ring for Slow, I would suggest you 
run all the way back, as the Malboro will use Slowga, which can slow you 
down and has a wide radius. It will not be funny if you are too slow to 
avoid all the attacks he throws at you, particularly when he has less than 
200 HP.

Another attack of the Malboro is the Poison Gas Attack. He will take a 
deep breath, and blow a large cloud of green poison gas out which can poison 
you. As his mouth is so wide, it will not be possible for your character 
to run to the side of the gas. Therefore, run back again. This move is 
easily detectable. You will see the Malboro spinning his head round and 
round with some green clouds in his mouth before spitting the gas out. 
Therefore, run as soon as you see it.

The Malboro, like the Giant Crab, has a desperation move that can be used 
once his HP drops below half of the total, that is, 200. This time, the 
Malboro will cast Blizzaga, the ultimate Blizzard move on you. This move 
has just a very large radius. Fortunately, it lacks range. Whenever you 
see a light blue target ring in conjunction with the Malboro looking at 
the ground, then you can know that he is about to cast Blizzaga onto you. 
Then RUN like mad! Otherwise, you will find yourself to be frozen solid 
and butchered! To protect yourself, you will need double protection from 
Cold, and hence I would recommend equipping a Frost Badge or Frost Armor 
in conjunction with the Water Element in the Crystal Chalice.

The boss battle arena here in the clearing provides you with a slight 
tactical advantage, particularly when you would like to heal yourself. 
See those 2 large toadstools at the far back of the stage? Whenever you 
are behind them, nothing can hit you, with the exception of the Ground 
Vine Attack and the Curse. Therefore, you can always hide behind them for 
the time being to heal yourself. But do not stay too long, or the Malboro 
can sneak a few vines up and hurt you bad.

Finally, the Malboro can attempt to draw you into him by some gusts of 
wind. Use that to your advantage, as the Malboro cannot attack nor damage 
you with this wind, and you can deal a couple of free hits while you are 
at it. See?

After some fighting, the Malboro will finally be defeated, and he will 
sort of shrink back to his original size and melt away, and you can get 
a drop of myrrh from the tree behind the remains of the malboro.

Boss: Orc King
Found in: Mine of Carthuiges
HP: 400
Attacks:
Giant Orc Hammer Slam
Charged Staff Explosion Slam
Staff Explosion Slam
Self Destruct (HP<70)
Minions: 2 Orcs
Useful Item: Orc Belt
Yes, the King of the Orcs is here to defend the myrrh tree. The selfish 
fool. He has 2 of his lower level Orcs coming from both sides of the arena 
to help him. Although it may be tough to beat so many foes coming from 
both sides at once, there is actually a way to quickly removing his minions. 

As you can see, you may have found 2 or 3 stones of Blizzard in the entire 
level. Therefore, you can go to the Command List on your menu, and line 
3 stones of Blizzard together to create the Blizzaga spell, which is the 
ultimate Blizzard Spell, now, just position your self at a remote corner 
and charge up the attack. Wait for the Orc King and his minions to get 
close, and then release the Blizzaga. A very large snowflake will appear, 
engulfing the Orcs and damaging the Orc King at the same time. Repeat this 
maneuver for a couple of times, and all the Orcs will be killed. Then, 
you can turn your attention to the maybe already damaged Orc King.

The Orc King likes to slam his blunt objects onto the ground to hurt you. 
Firstly, he can swing his Orc Hammer down onto you with his right hand. 
This deals considerable damage to you, but will not stun you at all. His 
Charged Staff Explosion Slam is just as damaging, and involves the Orc 
King raising his staff, charging it and aiming it at the targeting ring 
on the ground, before releasing a fiery explosion there. This is not hard 
to ignore, but the worst situation you will be in is when an Orc managed 
to stun you with his shield just a second before the Orc King releases 
his attack. Therefore, it is important that all Orcs should be terminated 
before the Orc King is faced. Sometimes, if you are outsmarting him a lot, 
the Orc King will just grow impatient and cheat. He will use his Staff 
Explosion Slam without having to charge up, and this is yet another 
annoyance to the typical player.

If your stats are not high enough, you should have a battle of attrition 
and only hit the Orc King while he is charging up the Charged Staff Explosion 
Slam. The other two attacks are so hard to avoid as they are so unpredictable. 
Slowly but steadily, you will drain HP from him. By the time he has had 
fewer than 70 HP, he will start burning up. I suggest you run away and 
hide in a corner. This is because, he is about to self destruct. Wait, 
wait, then you will find the room suddenly becoming very bright and hear 
a very loud explosion, and all of his Orc minions collapsing at the same 
time. After the room has quieted down, go over to the Orc King and he should 
drop to the ground and explode once more. Then you would have won!

Boss: Cave Worm
HP: 500
Attacks:
Harmful Brown Gas Spray
Side to Side Sway
Slow Bubble (Slows)
High Jump Ground Stomp (If HP<250)
Resistance: Cold
Minions: 2 Electric Jellyfish
Useful Item: Wind Crystal (~218 points)
Recommended Equipment: Crystal Chalice with Wind Element or Thunder Badge
You are now up against the guardian of the Myrrh Tree of Selepation Cave. 
The Cave Worm is a very big worm with 4 feathery flaps covering his big 
circular mouth. He is aided by 2 Electric Jellyfish. Of course, direct 
physical contact is not recommended with the Electric Jellyfish, as you 
will end up having an electric shock while fighting them. To prevent this 
from happening, it is vital that your character has some protection from 
lightning attacks. This is where the Thunderbadge or the Wind Element comes 
in. Then, it will not be very hard for your character to run up to the 
Electric Jellyfish and kill them in a couple of hits. Then, you can turn 
your attention to the Cave Worm.

(I know, it is possible to kill the electric jellyfish with spells, but 
I just won't bother. This is because, while you are charging the spell, 
the Cave Worm just might suck you into him, making it difficult to aim 
at the Electric Jellyfish accurately.)

Now, the Cave Worm really is a tough one to beat. First of all, he has 
a massive 500 HP at the third cycle and beyond, which means that characters 
with a weak strength and magic just won't cut it out in this battle, and 
would have to fight a very long and enduring battle of attrition. Yes, 
battle of attrition is not a very fun game, particularly that you will 
have to use countless Phoenix Downs to stay alive.

Now, on to the attacks. At close and medium range, the Cave Worm will let 
out some brown smoke at your character, and that deals a lot of damage 
to you. Maybe he is trying to excrete his poison waste at you! This is 
just hard for your character to avoid, as the Cave Worm will sway his body 
to the left and right to ensure even distribution of smoke in almost all 
directions. You can tell that he is about to use this move when he sorts 
of holding his breath for a mere second. Then run to the side. It seems 
that as wide as the attack may seem, there is still a blind spot to the 
left or right of the Cave Worm while he is swing his head round and round. 
You can take advantage of that blind spot and run into it, and then you 
can deal a couple of free hits on the Cave Worm while he is doing so.

On the other hand, if you start outwitting the Cave Worm with the above 
strategy, he will just get annoyed and do a more practical and more accurate 
approach to things his way. Remember the cut scene where he sways side 
to side, knocking debris down from the ceiling? That is what the Cave Worm 
will do. This time, it will cover the entire wide angle right in front 
of the Cave Worm, which means it cannot be outwitted. Besides, the swaying 
action of the Cave Worm will create some sort of a shockwave in the areas 
right in front of the Cave Worm. Which means that you may be hit even if 
you are not touching the Cave Worm at all. This move deals the same damage 
as the brown cloud attack. Whenever you see the Cave Worm's body shifting 
to the left or right, it is time to run back.

The Cave Worm, like the Malboro, is a stationary boss. His attacks lack 
in range. Maybe it is because he is stuck between the walls of that narrow 
tunnel that leads to the daylight. Therefore, whenever you are wounded, 
you can always retreat to the opposite end of the arena to heal yourself, 
provided that you can outsmart the Electric Jellyfish before hand. Of 
course, you don't need to worry about them if you have already taken them 
out in the first place.

Of course, the Cave Worm is not stupid. He has only one long range attack, 
and it does not deal you any damage, and is easy to avoid. It is his slow 
bubble, that can slow your character down when hit. It is simply a ballistic 
attack, and will not lock onto your character like that of the Giant Crab. 
If you are slowed down, immediately cast Clear on the character. As he/she 
is just so far away, it won't be difficult to do so.

The Cave Worm, like the Malboro can suck in air in an attempt to draw your 
character close to him. The good thing is that, even if you are sucked, 
you will not be sucked into the Cave Worm's mouth and eaten alive. You 
will just be sucked into the body of the Cave Worm. As the Cave Worm cannot 
damage you with this move, you can treat it as a bonus and land a couple 
more free hits on the Cave Worm while he is at it. Then run back as he 
is about to sway side to side again to avoid damage.

The Cave Worm, like many other bosses, has his own desperation move. When 
he has less than 250 HP, he will repeat one of the actions in the cutscene 
by jumping up, then landing down, releasing a large shockwave. This move 
really is devastating. To give you an impression on how damaging it is, 
I once has a character with 76 defense getting hit by the attack, and then, 
2 and a half hearts were taken off him. Which means, for the average player, 
this move might be their undoing! You can tell that the Cave Worm is ready 
to perform this move when he jumps up 7 feet into the air. Once he is airborne, 
retreat! Run away as fast as your legs can carry you. Or suffer the 
consequences of this large hit.

In conclusion, the Cave Worm is a monster with a lot of lethal close quarter 
attacks, but lacks in range. Therefore, if you are really the coward that 
you are, you can always play it safe by fusing 2 stones of Fire or 2 stones 
of Thunder together, then use the fused spell on him. No, you cannot use 
Blizzara on him, as he is immune to it. If you can, use the third level 
spells on him, and you can hit him from an even longer range, without any 
fears of damage. The Cave Worm is not versatile due to his immobile nature. 
You can also run in, hit him a couple of times, then retreat, and repeat.

Regardless of which method you choose to adopt, it will be a long and tough 
boss battle. Eventually, all the 500 HP from the Cave Worm will be drained. 
He will make a last cry in pain, and he will collapse, and start to shrivel 
up. He melts in a pile of green slime and giving out lots of steam.

Boss: Lizardman King
Found in: Daemon's Court
HP: 400
Attacks:
Rapid Arm Sweep
Left Arm Spike
Multiple Fire Arrow Attack (Burns)
Multiple Ice Arrow Attack (Freezes)
Resistance: Fire
Minions: 1 Lizard Skirmisher, 2 Coeurls
Useful Item: King's Scale
You are now up against some sort of giant lizard with metallic parts, much 
like a robot. This is the roman coliseum, and hence wild animals are always 
there to assist the home fighter. The two Coeurls you meet will stay with 
their master and fight you, therefore, you should always kill them before 
you fight the Lizardman King. At the same time, a Lizard Skirmisher will 
assist the Lizardman King from the backgrounds. 

See those red switches all around the arena? The Lizard Skirmisher will 
stand on one of them, and will then activate some kind of rolling blade 
out of the ground that will go after your character. Not only your character 
will receive damage when hit, the next hit dealt to him/her will do double 
the usual amount of damage. Therefore, you must avoid the blade at all 
costs. However, the good thing is that the blade is easily detectable. 
If you hear grinding sounds, it means that the blade is coming after you. 
The blade also be used on the Lizard King. You can just lure the blade 
into him, and he will be damaged, and you can deal double damage to him 
the next time you hit him too.

You can also use the blade against the Lizardman King and his subjects. 
Just kill the lizard skirmisher and step on the switch yourself. The blade 
will then move around the stage, and any enemy that gets into the way will 
be killed very quickly. (But they will not be rendered mincemeat, unlike 
doom and other more violent games. Tee hee...)

The Lizardman King's subjects are not very bright. You kill them, and they 
will reappear. Yes, but as long as you stay far away from them, they will 
again, not come after you even if you are hitting their king! Those guys 
must be deaf as doorknobs. Therefore, if all other enemies are out of sight, 
there is a good chance that you can just focus on the Lizardman King. Even 
if you have attracted their attention, they still not be able to come at 
you all at once.

Now, speaking of the Lizardman King, let's have some analysis of his moves, 
and how to avoid them. Firstly, the Lizardman King will attempt to use 
his left arm to spike you. See all those spike on the tip of his left arm? 
One of them will stick out and hit you, resulting in heavy damage. The 
good thing is that this move is also easily detectable. Whenever you see 
the Lizardman withdrawing his left arm, then you know it is time to run 
away. Another thing is that the scope of this move is limited. The Lizardman 
King will swing his arm directly to the area in front of his left arm. 
Which means that if he attempts to use the move while you are hitting him 
from his right side, chances are that it will miss completely and you can 
just continue to bash him with your weapon.

Of course, enemies like the Lizardman King are not always that stupid. 
They, like many other bosses including the Cave Worm that you just fought. 
If you manage to outwit the Lizardman for far too many times, he will just 
get annoyed, and will use both of his arms to sweep around the area in 
front of him. Whenever he does this, then you must run back as there are 
no blind spots to this move. But still, this move only has a little knock 
back and will deal a little damage to your character so it doesn't matter 
a lot, anyway.

The Lizardman King is well suited for long range combat as well. See his 
right hand? There is a shield implanted on it, as well as a multi arrow 
bow that can hold up to 5 arrows at once. They fire the arrows at all 
directions the Lizardman King faces here. The red arrows are fire arrow 
and the blue arrows are the ice arrows. The former will burn you while 
the latter one will freeze you in. You can tell that the Lizardman King 
is about to lower his right arm, with the shield bow thingy parallel to 
the ground. The best way to avoid this is to stay put, and wiggle between 
two arrows as they fly towards you. Running around like a nutcase does 
not help at all.

While you are bashing the Lizardman from the front, he may sometimes go 
into a defensive stance by place his left arm in front of him, perpendicular 
to the ground. You will be in for a treat if that happens. Just run behind 
him and send in the free hits!

After some fighting, the Lizardman King will not be able to take it anymore. 
He spins around in a daze, and will fall to the ground and pass out. The 
screen whitens, and you hear a sizzling sound, I guess he must have molten 
or vaporized or something like that.

Boss: Armstrong
Found in: Tida
HP: 400
Attacks:
Needle Storm
Fence Sweep
Poison Gas (Poisons)
Slowness Gas (Slows)
Regular Cannon Barrage
Accursed Cannon Barrage (Curses) (HP <200)
Stopping Cannon Barrage (Paralyzes) (HP <200)
Resistance: Lightning
Minions: 2 Skeleton Mages
Useful Item: Dweomer Spore (~213 points)
No, this is not the first man on the moon. It's just some ugly freaky like 
building, with a chimney as a cannon, and a fence for its arm. The Armstrong 
is supported by 2 Skeleton Mages. Yes, they can be annoying if you have 
to concentrate on Armstrong. Therefore, use hit and run tactics to kill 
them before you face Armstrong man to man, or man to house.

Armstrong the house has a wider variety of attacks, many of them with a 
long range. First, he has the needle storm, where he will simply wind up 
and let out a large number of white needles at your character. This is 
detectable when Armstrong places his fence arm across his chest, and 
needles will come out of his er... mouth on his bulb like head.

If you hit him up close for too long, he will just swing out his fence 
like arm in an attempt to smack you back. This move will always knock your 
character back. Whenever you see Armstrong withdrawing his fence like arm, 
then you will know that you have to run back and avoid it.

Besides, Armstrong will sometimes let out green gas from his mouth which 
is poisonous. This attack is medium range at best. Like many other enemies, 
Armstrong will take a deep breath before he will let out the gas. Whenever 
he is starting to suck in air into his mouth, you will know that he will 
blow out poison gas soon. At that point, you can get behind him and bash 
him while he lets out the gas without worries of retaliation.

There is only one attack that can come out without warning, and is difficult 
to avoid. That attack is the slowness gas. While your character is busy 
bashing him at close range. He may suddenly let out some blue smoke around 
the foundations of the house. This gas will surround Armstrong, and your 
character will just slow down. Even if you are slowed down, don't panic. 
Just continue to hit him until your status ailment is gone.

As you can see from the boss fight cut scene, the chimney of Armstrong 
can be used as a cannon of sorts. In fact, he can always fire some green 
cannon balls out that can do some damage to your character. Fortunately, 
the cannon balls are not homing missiles. Therefore, once he lets out the 
bomb, it won't be difficult to avoid it. Apart from this, you can tell 
if he is going to shoot you with his cannon when he lowers it so that it 
is parallel to the ground.

Armstrong is resistant to lightning, but as it is made of wood, it is quite 
vulnerable to fire. In fact, one single Fire spell can set him alight and 
lower his defense, then your character can deal more damage per hit.

Armstrong, like many other bosses of Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles, 
has his own desperation moves. Whenever his HP drops below half of the 
total, that is 200, Armstrong will start to add new flavors to his 
cannonballs. Sometimes, he will fire purple cannon balls. IF your character 
is hit, he/she will be cursed, and his/her attributes will be cut by half. 
Armstrong can also fire orange cannon balls at you, which can stop time 
around you completely. Making you helpless for a few seconds.

Anyway, after some fighting, Armstrong will eventually be down. He loses 
the last of the energy inside him. He stands stills for a second. Then 
explodes and falls to the ground.

You can now watch as your character collects myrrh from the tree in a 
deserted village. Mail Moogle will come to send mail, and you can reply 
whatever you like. Then, you will be treated to the Item Selection Screen.

In this level, if you get a high score of about 213 points, you may be 
able to choose the Dweomer Spore from Armstrong. This material can be used 
to craft the Elemental's Soul. With the item in hand, you can now get out 
of this creepy village and back to civilization.

Boss: Gigas Lord
Found in: Moschet Manor
HP: 400
Attacks: 
Giant Punch
Ground Stomp
Ice Breath (Freezes)
Full Heal (If Maggie is present)
Resistance: Cold
Useful Item: Lords Robe (Uncertain Score)

Minion: Maggie
HP: 125
Attacks:
Dual Fan Smack
Slowga
Stop

You are now up against the owner of the Moschet Manor, Jack Moschet. He 
is so mad that you have killed his cooks that he wants to fight for revenge. 
Go forward and hit him, just once. his wife, Maggie would come and 
intervene.

It is very essential that you knock out Maggie first, as the Gigas Lord 
will just heal himself and Maggie to full health from time to time. Maggie 
is not much of a threat. She just slows you down with Slowga and attempts 
to put you in stasis with Stop. To prevent her from being healed, Run into 
her, and push her away from her husband. Then start bashing her like crazy, 
healing yourself if she smacks you too hard. Eventually, all of her health 
will be depleted, and she will walk to the side and spin around dizzily. 
You can now face the Gigas Lord without any interference at all.

The Gigas Lord attacks just like a normal Gigas, only that his attacks 
are much stronger. His most typical attack is the giant punch, which has 
no knock back. I thought of a way to exploit this move in a multiplayer 
game. One day, I was playing with my cousin, and she had a weaker character. 
I stood my character in front of the Gigas Lord and bashed him. Jack Moschet 
continued to bash me, while my cousin snuck in behind him and bash him. 
Now, the Gigas Lord practically ignored her existence, and just punched 
me while I kept healing myself, and over 200 HP was drained from him this 
way!

Sometimes, the Gigas Lord may be more cautious, and he would jump up in 
the air and stomp down, creating a shockwave. This is one attack that cannot 
be avoided when you are up to him. Finally, the Gigas Lord will resort 
to the Ice Breath, that an be countered by a Frost Badge. Easy.

Eventually you will beat the Gigas Lord and he will start bashing the ground 
like a little baby and run off, and his angry wife Maggie will chase him 
out of the house!

Boss: Golem
HP: 400
Attacks:
Giant Punch
Rapid Long Arm Spin
Dual Fist Missile Launch
Red Fire Beam (Burns)
Blue Ice Beam (Freezes)
Slowness Gas
Minions: 2 Water Flans
Useful Item: Green Sphere
You are now up against the robot guardian of the myrrh tree of Veo Lu. 
Apparently he has been placed here by the Yukes to guard the sluice from 
monsters but he is now programmed to attack any intruders here. The Golem 
is assisted by 2 minions, 2 Water Flans, to be precise. The 2 Water Flans 
are not a big deal. However, if you are playing in a 2-player game, then 
4 Water Flans will be present to help their master!

Fortunately, Water Flans are very easy to deal with. They tend to group 
together and can only deal very little damage. As they are so weak against 
fire, wait for all of them to bunch up at once. Then cast a couple of Fira 
Spells and they will all melt down. Then, you can focus on the Golem.

The Golem is a robot, and many robots have many features. First, at close 
range, the Golem will just bash your character twice with its two gigantic 
fists. This is rather difficult to avoid, as it comes out without warning, 
and that is the most unpredictable close range attack in the game. TO avoid 
it well, the safe way would be to maintain your distance, and use focus 
attacks or spells.

A close range, Golem can also stick his arms out really long, and will 
start to spin around like a spinning top. This is another really devastating 
move. If your character is right next to the body of the Golem, they can 
take up to two hits before they can break free. Fortunately, you can tell 
he is about to use it when he sticks his arms out. Thanks to a rather long 
delay. You should be able to run just far enough to get only one hit, or 
if you are super fast, none at all.

As the Golem is just so deadly at close range, my advice is to use ranged 
focus attacks and spells if your defense is below 50.

Of course, Golem also shines when long range combat is concerned. After 
all he is a robot. The first attack is the dual fist missile launch, where 
the Golem will act like someone in those Japanese robot cartoons, and will 
launch both of their fists at you! You can tell when Golem lowers his arms 
so that they are parallel to the ground. They are just so easy to avoid, 
and you can usually get between the two hands. After the two fists have 
been launched, it will take a few seconds for Golem to gain new hands, 
and you can run in and bash him freely in that duration of time.

The Golem also has his own series of death rays. There are two types, a 
red type, where he will zap the area around him, and then letting out a 
big explosion. It does not matter whether you touch the beam, or get hit 
by the explosion, the end result is a burn. Therefore, run when you see 
him spinning the beam round.

The other death ray is blue in colour, and the Golem will fire two of them 
in a criss cross pattern directly in front of him. This is easier to avoid. 
Just don't get hit by the beam and you will not be frozen. In both cases, 
the Golem will squat down onto the ground, and hence you will know when 
to run away.

The final attack is another status changing one. The Golem, much like 
Armstrong, will let out blue gas that slows you down. This is just 
unpredictable. But if you are slowed down. Stay calm, don't panic, and 
continue with the bashing.

Eventually, the Golem's HP will be completely depleted, and you will see 
the sphere on Golem's chest flashing between red, yellow and green. Finally, 
the sphere decides to stay in a yellow colour. The expression on the sphere 
turns into a sad look. The Golem then collapses and falls into a lot of 
tiny pieces. The camera will then focus on the central part of Golem's 
body. Now, the sphere is having a neutral expression, and it turns off.

Dragon Zombie
Found in: Conall Curach
HP: 400
Attacks:
Lunge Bite
Head Shake
Poison Liquid Sweep (Poisons)
Petrifying Beam (Petrifies)
Wide and Thick Beam
Vulnerability: Holy
Resistance: All attacks when invisible
Minions: 2 Stone Sahagins
Yes, they are combining Resident Evil elements in the game. A Dragon Zombie? 
Oh well. The Dragon Zombie's two Stone Sahagins are rather easily dealt 
with while you are avoiding the Dragon Zombie's attacks, cast Gravity on 
both of them at once. They then can bash them to death in 10 hits each. 
This is not hard, assuming that you have the stats I recommended you to 
have.

Now, for the Dragon Zombie. You cannot attack him directly, as you are 
stranded on wooden floats, isolated from his island. This also means that 
he cannot attack you easily with direct physical attacks. His head shake, 
and lunge bite are easily avoided if you stay away from the edge facing 
him, amazing that even a simple shake in the head is an attack!

Now, you got his ranged attacks to deal with. The Dragon Zombie will fire 
a bright yellow beam at you that can petrify you, turning you into satone. 
This can be nullified if you are wearing a Gold Necklace in the first place. 
On the other hand, his poison liquid sweep really is unavoidable, as the 
zombie can sweep it across the entire set of floats you are on. In that 
case, use Clear immediately to restore your health.

The final attack is very devastating. It can take one heart and a half 
off a character with 79 defense. It is his Wide and Thick Beam. This is 
easily detectable. Once you start to see the beam form, run out of the 
way. Then you can avoid damage. It is easier to pull off if those 2 Stone 
Sahagins are out of the way.

Now, it's time to counterattack. The Dragon Zombie is stealthed like those 
ghosts out there. This is when Holy is useful. In such a chaotic situation, 
It is better if one person can cast the spell by himself, and multiplayer 
games will be tougher. Use Holy and the Dragon Zombie will appear. Hey 
presto! You can then resort to spells and ranged focus attacks. If you 
are feeling unconfident, then just use Holy again and again, and he will 
eventually be defeated.

Boss: Lich
Found in: Rebena Te Ra
HP: 500
Attacks:
Meteor Strike
Medium Sized Explosion (Burns)
Electric Discharge (Shocks)
Vulnerability: Holy
Resistance: All attacks when invisible
Minion: 1 Skeleton
Useful Item: Ethereal Orb (~207 points)
Regardless of how close you are to the last area of the game. This is one 
of the easiest bosses to beat. Firstly, the Lich only has a single minion, 
a Skeleton Mage. This is very easy to kill in spite of the Lich's continuing 
attacks. Now that the minion is killed let's have a closer look at the 
Lich's own attacks, shall we?

It seems that the Lich only has projectile attacks. Although they pack 
a punch, they can be easily detected and avoided as all of them have a 
long charging time. Whenever you see a blue dot on the ground. An electric 
discharge is on the way. When you see a purple dot on the ground, a medium 
sized explosion is on the way. Once you see those coming, run away! It 
is much easier to do so in single player than multiplayer, as it is hard 
to run around with a Crystal Chalice over your head. The meteor strike 
is by far, the hardest attack to avoid. So there.

Now, it is time to fight back. You will notice in the cut scene that the 
Lich got the force field's energy from the balls on poles? That's right, 
you will have to deactivate his force field before you can hit him. Cast 
Fire on the red one, and Blizzard on the blue one. Now, the only thing 
that is protecting the Lich is his invisibility, which can be removed by 
the Holy Spell.

After the Lich is revealed, you can either continue to use Holy on him, 
or just bash, Holy, bash until he is defeated. Although he has 500 HP, 
he shouldn't prove too hard to beat. Once he has no more HP, the Lich will 
spin around uncontrollably, and will be absorbed into the throne.

Boss: Iron Giant
Found in: Mount Kilanda
HP: 500
Attacks:
Sword Soulshot
Sword Slash
Sword Ground Bash
Charging Tackle
Heavy Electric Discharge (Shocks)
Electric Ground Pound
Resistance: Lightning, Gravity
Minions: 2 Goblin Mages
Useful Item: Red Eye
So, it's the Iron Giant. I remember watching a movie with a similar name 
on HBO, and my, this Iron Giant does look like that one. First things first. 
The Iron Giant has 2 Goblin Mages to support it. Now, this is not a hard 
combination. As you probably have picked up 2 stones of Blizzard. Wait 
for the Iron Giant and the 2 Goblin Mages to bunch up together, and then 
cast Blizzara into the middle of the bunch. The 2 Goblin Mages will be 
frozen solid, and the Iron Giant at the meantime will take some wanton 
damage as well. Repeat this and eventually both Goblin Mages will be killed.

Now, it's time for our character to face the Iron Giant himself. No, you 
are not going to lure him into a series of electric wires or launch an 
atomic bomb at him. No. Let us analyze his attacks now. The Iron Giant 
has 2 different sets of attacks, one when he is armed with a sword, and 
one when he is unarmed. When he is armed, he may attempt to slash you with 
a sword. You can tell when he swings his sword back. To dodge it, do not 
run in the direction of his slash. When you are far away, the Iron Giant 
can launch a large purple ball of soulshot, much like the Soulshot focus 
attack of the Excalibur at you. This is easy to avoid. Keep your distance, 
and you will be fine. Another attack is his sword bash. He will raise his 
sword high into the air, and slam it down onto the ground. This is again 
easy to dodge. And it does not matter whether you get hit or not, the sword 
will hit the ground. I quote the following passage from Horrible Histories: 
Dark Knights and Dingy Castles: "King Richard set off on the Third Crusade 
and took a hawk from a peasant - he said hawks should be used only by lords. 
A mob of peasants surrounded him and Richard slapped one man with the flat 
sword blade. It snapped. Richard just about escaped with his life. Swords 
wer blunt and brittle things for bashing, not slicing." Well, of course, 
the sword the Iron Giant uses is just as brittle. If he hits the ground 
too many times, the sword will snap. Therefore, you can just dodge this 
again and again, until the Iron Giant runs out of spare swords. Then, he 
is unarmed! Ha ha!

Now, when he is unarmed, the Iron Giant will resort to more desperate 
tactics. Firstly, he will do a charging tackle on you, which again, and 
be dodged while he approaches. There is a short lag after he executes the 
move, and at that time you can move in for some free hits. Now, the Iron 
Giant will also pound the ground with his giant fists. Whenever you see 
his fists turn blue with electric charges on them, you will know that you 
will have to run. Finally, the Iron Giant will discharge a large amount 
of electricity at the same time. This move has a target ring. If you see 
a blue target ring with electric bolts on it, run away. This move has a 
very wide radius and can give your character an electric shock.

As for combat, I would recommend you to keep your distance and consistently 
cast Blizzara or Fira spells on the Iron Giant. Thundara will just not 
cut out because the Iron Giant is resistant to gravity. After all, the 
Iron Giant lacks any ranged attack, and he basically will not have any 
effective ones once he is disarmed.

If you run around the stage, you will see some urns of water along with 
some holes with Fire in them. If you toss an urn into the hole, a lot of 
steam will gush out. If you can lure the Iron Giant to one of the holes, 
you may be able to damage him considerably, although not critically, 
therefore I would not recommend using those unless your stats are poor. 
If you really have the guts, you can just run in and use normal physical 
attacks with hit and run tactics. As the Iron Giant is so slow and sluggish, 
it would not be hard to do so.

Eventually, you will have defeated the Iron Giant, and yes, you don't need 
to use the atomic bomb! The Iron Giant will simply fall to the ground, 
and you can have a close up view of his face, including his lovely red 
eyes. Ooh. Lovely.

Boss: Antlion
Found in: Lynari Desert
HP: 625
Attacks:
Petrifying Dust Attack (Petrifies)
Giant Fang Bite
Leg Stomp Shockwave
Heavy Electric Discharge (Shocks, if HP<250)
Resistance: Lightning
Minions: 2 Scorpions
Useful Item: Desert Fang
Recommended Equipment: Gold Necklace in conjunction with Earth Element 
in the Crystal Chalice
That's it. You are up against the strongest non-final boss in the game, 
which is the Antlion. With a massive 625 HP, this giant ant monster can 
prove a very tough nut to crack provided that you do not play your cards 
right. The first thing in the agenda will be to get rid of the Antlion's 
two minions, the two Scorpions. I would suggest you to run around, and 
wait for the two Scorpions as well as the Antlion to bunch up together. 
Then, cast the Blizzara onto them all. The ice will engulf th two Scorpions, 
as well as dealing considerable damage to the Antlion. Repeat this for 
a few times until they are all dead. Now, you can face the Antlion.

Now, for the Antlion. The Antlion taunts a wide variety of moves, and he 
is more versatile than you think. Plus the camera angle is very tricky, 
and therefore it is easy for your character to be trapped against the wall 
of the pit, allowing for the Antlion to give you the free hit.

First off, the Antlion attacks by blowing a large stream of dust at your 
character, thereby petrifying him/her. You will know when the Antlion looks 
as if he is taking a deep breath. This dust is a Class 2 Petrifying Product. 
Therefore, if you just come walking in with the Earth Element of the Crystal 
Chalice, you will end up being petrified still. As double protection have 
a Gold Necklace equipped. OK? Then, the dust will just bounce off your 
character, allowing your character to gain some free his right up the 
Antlion's face! On the other hand, it really is not a disadvantage even 
if you do not have both the aforesaid items equipped. When the Antlion 
takes a deep breath, run to the side. The dust will flow out and miss, 
while you can just hit him from a side a couple of times before he stops. 
Make sure you run away right after he finishes executing this move.

The reason why I told you so is because, if you hang around too close to 
the Antlion, he can just stomp all his six feet onto the ground, resulting 
in a large shockwave that may just hit your character a couple of times, 
dealing rather heavy damage. I am sure you do not want your fight to be 
that painful. You can tell that the Antlion is going to use this move when 
he puts all of his legs up above the ground. Then run! But still, it may 
just be too late and your character may have to get shocked once. The worst 
thing to happen to your character is that he/she will be trapped in a narrow 
gap between the Antlion and the wall of the pit. Then, you will be sandwiched 
for sure! Finally, the Antlion has a higher chance of performing the said 
move if you even try to hit him from behind. So, don't ever try unless 
you have a high enough defense!

Oh, now that you can avoid his rear gunning attacks, now, you are to avoid 
his frontal attacks. Now, except for brief moments, the Antlion will always 
try to face your character. Although he will blow dust at your face most 
of the time, he will sometimes follow you around, and use his giant desert 
fangs to bite your character with a great big snip! No, don't worry, your 
character will not be cut in half from the waist down, however, it does 
result in lots of pain! Well, try getting cut into half from the waist 
down in real life and you will see! It is so damaging, that it can still 
take 1 and a half hearts off a chracter with over 70 defense! You can tell 
when the Antlion opens his mouth, or I should say, spreads out his fangs 
real wide, and then, you should be ready to run in the opposite direction 
of the mouth. Note that running to the right or left may also work, but 
the chance of your character getting hit will increase. Yes, like the 
previous attack, the worst place your character could be is to be stuck 
in a narrow gap between the wall and the Antlion. There really is no escape 
if that happens. This is why the Antlion is so tough.

To beat the Antlion, I would advise your charcter to attack from a range. 
It is just too risky to get in close as your character will risk getting 
hit. You should use more level 2 spells on the Antlion. Fira and Blizzara 
will be lovely, but Thundara should not be cast as it has absolutely no 
effect on the Antlion. Level 3 spells are also not to be cast unless your 
are a Yuke, after all, in such a critical time, who would want to stand 
still for that long to charge up the attack? Oh, if you have the guts, 
you can also cast Gravity as the first spell on the Antlion. That will 
take out 10% of its energy, which is a large number considering the high 
total HP of the Antlion. Slowly but surely, the Antlion's HP will go down.

The Antlion, like most of the other bosses has a desperation move. When 
you have damaged the Antlion to an extent that it has 250 HP or less left, 
it will start to use its Heavy Electric Discharge attack. The Antlion will 
simply use his two desert fangs as electrodes, and build up an excess of 
electric charges. Then, it will be a blast as he releases it in one giant 
bolt of electricity. Now, this move really has a long recharge time. It 
has such a delay and once you see him charge, you can quickly move out 
of the way and fight. Deliver a few free hits with your weapon while he 
is still shooting out the electricity!

Eventually, the Antlion's massive 625 HP will be depleted, and you have 
officially beaten the hardest non-final boss of the game. The Antlion will 
then make one final cry and black out on the ground. His body will sink 
into the sand, which sinks with his body, revealing the cave with the Myrrh 
Tree.

d. Artifacts [A2D]
-------------------
Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles has a system of leveling up that is unique 
to all the other Final Fantasies. (At least that is Square-Enix's tradition) 
To level up, killing enemies endlessly is NEVER the solution. Instead, 
you only get to level up once in the end of a level, after you have beaten 
the boss. The artifacts you get is dependent on how many bonus points your 
character gets during the game. If you are playing a multiplayer game, 
with 2 to 4 players, the character with the highest number of bonus points 
gets the first choice. There are in total of 6 types of artifacts you can 
find. They are Strength Boosting Artifacts, Defense Boosting Artifacts, 
Magic Boosting Artifacts, Command Slot Artifacts, Heart Artifacts and 
Magicite Rings. Now, let me introduce each type of artifact to you, one 
by one. Each level now will have its own Artifact List, so you will know 
which levels you can find a certain artifact. (Note: The Score requirements 
for each level are rounded up to the nearest 10.)

----------------------------
Strength Boosting Artifacts
----------------------------
Simply put, choosing these artifacts will allow your character's Strength 
to be permanently increased between 1 to 5 units. There is a considerable 
number of such artifacts in this game, as each character can only have 
one weapon to boost his/her Strength.

Artifacts that boost your Strength by 1 include:
Ashura, Double Axe, Fang Charm, Green Beret, Kaiser Knuckles, Maneater, 
Onion Sword, Power Wristband and Shuriken.

Artifacts that boost your Strength by 2 include:
Engetsurin, Flametongue, Ice Brand, Loaded Dice, Ogre Killer and Twisted 
Headband.

Artifacts that boost your Strength by 3 include:
Giant's Glove, Heavy Armband, Masquerade and Sasuke's Blade.

Artifacts that boost your Strength by 4 include:
Murasame.

Artifacts that boost your Strength by 5 include:
Gekkabijin and Masamune.

---------------------------
Defense Boosting Artifacts
---------------------------
If you choose a Defense Boosting Artifact in the Item Selection Screen, 
then your character's Defense will be permanently increased by a number 
between 1 and 5. There are fewer Defense Boosting Artifacts than Strength 
Boosting Artifacts, mainly because each character can equip him/herself 
with 2 Defensive Items.

Artifacts that boost your Defense by 1 include:
Buckler, Drill, Silver Spectacle, Sparkling Bracer.

Artifacts that boost your Defense by 2 include:
Arai Helm, Black Hood, Elven Mantle, Main Gauche, Rat's Tail and Teddy 
Bear.

Artifacts that boost your Defense by 3 include:
Chicken Knife and Wonder Bangle.

Artifacts that boost your Defense by 4 include:
Protection Ring and Save Queen.

Artifacts that boost your Defense by 5 include:
Aegis.

-------------------------
Magic Boosting Artifacts
-------------------------
You know the drill, if your character chooses a Magic Boosting Artifact 
from the Item Selection Screen, your character's Magic will be increased 
by a number between 1 and 10! This is mainly because, there are no items 
that can increase your Magic by equipping them. For the same reason, the 
Magic Boosting Artifacts make up the majority of all the Artifacts you 
will find in the game.

Artifacts that boost your Magic by 1 include:
Book of Light, Candy Ring, Cat's Bell, Dragon's Whisker, Faerie Ring, Mage 
Masher, Rune Staff, Silver Bracer and Winged Cap.

Artifacts that boost your Magic by 3 include:
Kris, Red Slippers, Rune Bell, Sage's Staff and Wonder Wand.

Artifacts that boost your Magic by 5 include:
Dark Matter, Gold Hairpin, Mage's Staff and Noah's Lute.

Artifacts that boost your Magic by 7 or above include:
Galatyn (+7), Taotie Motif (+7), Ribbon (+9) and Ultima Tome (+10).

----------------------
Command Slot Artifacts 
----------------------
Initially, your character would have only 4 Command Slots, but with the 
help of Command Slot Artifacts, more Command Slots can be gained, resulting 
in your character having up to 8 Command Slots. The 4 Artifacts are all 
pockets, and they are Moogle Pocket, Chocobo Pocket, Gobbie Pocket and 
Ultimate Pocket.

----------------
Heart Artifacts 
----------------
All chracters start with 4 hearts, and will prove to have a heart time 
against bosses with powerful attacks. The Heart Artifacts are here to fix 
that. With their help, more hearts can be gained, resulting in your 
character having up to 8 hearts. The 4 Artifacts are all Pendants, and 
they are Earth Pendant, Moon Pendant, Star Pendant and Sun Pendant.

---------------
Magicite Rings
---------------
Having the need to cast a spell anywhere, and there are no stones of Magicite 
for that spell? Fear not, the Magicite Rings are here. The Magicite Rings 
allow your character to cast spells at any time. Each ring also adds 1 
to your character's Magic Stat, which makes it worthwhile to collect them 
even if you may think they are not needed. The 5 Rings include the Blizzard 
Ring, Fire Ring, Thunder Ring, Cure Ring and Life Ring. Sorry, but there 
is no Clear Ring. Tough luck.

*****RIVER BELLE PATH*****
In the Item Selection Screen, you will be told the number of bonus points 
you received. You can choose from up to 8 artifacts or items, with the 
highest scoring player getting the first choice. If you get a high enough 
score of around 150, then you may get to keep the Ancient Sword stuck onto 
the Giant Crab as a little souvenir. This ancient sword can be sold for 
7500 gil, and can be used to forge the Ragnarok, which is the Dark Weapon 
of the Clavats. Therefore, keep it if you need it.

Note: The artifact marked with an asterisk (*) should be the winning 
chracter's first choice.

Set 1 (Buckler, Dragon's Whisker, Moogle Pocket*, Shuriken):

artifact that increases the character's Magic by 7!

e. Materials [A2E]
-------------------
*****METALLIC MATERIALS*****
Bronze
Found on: Many different enemies and merchants
Cost: 250 gil 
Can be used to make: Many, many weapons, armor and accessories
Well, Bronze is just an alloy of copper and tin, although I think the mix 
ratio between the two metals is 2:1. Bronze is quite a strong and common 
material, and it can be found in many enemies in the early cycles of easy 
stages like River Belle Path. Otherwise, you can just find merchants like 
Gi Lubeh or your village merchant to buy Bronze from them at a price of 
250 gil per chunk. These ARE NOT good selling items. Always try to find 
uses for them if you happen to pick one up.

Iron
Found on: Many different enemies and merchants
Cost: 500 gil 
Can be used to make: Many, many weapons, armor and accessories
Iron is a stronger and more durable material here in Final Fantasy: Crystal 
Chronicles, and my bet is that this Iron is actually Mild Steel. Otherwise, 
it could not have been as tough as Bronze, which is an alloy itself. Iron 
appears as silvery tetrahedral chunks in the playing field. They can be 
found in many enemies and merchants, and they can still be found on enemies 
in the third cycle of River Belle Path. Otherwise, buy it from a merchant 
for 500 gil. Again, chunks of Iron ARE NOT good selling items.

Mythril
Found on: Slightly stronger enemies and merchants
Cost: 5000 gil
Can be used to make: Master's Weapon, Mythril Armor, many types of special 
protective armor and other items
This has got to be the first made up metallic material in Final Fantasy: 
Crystal Chronicles. Mythril is actually some kind of blue coloured mythical 
metal, and it appears as blue octahedrals in the playing field. As it is 
such an expensive material, the developers of this game have the right 
mind to charge them a ludicrous 5000 gil for a single chunk. The good thing 
is that Mythril can be found in many common strong enemies like Griffins, 
Orcs or Goblin Chieftains. Therefore, if you have a run inside places like 
the Mine of Carthuiges, you may be in for a treat. Mythril is used to forge 
many medium-high end weapons and armor, such as the Master's Weapon or 
maybe Holy Armor, to name a few. Mythril is a good selling item. If you 
have excess Mythril in stock, sell them for 1250 gil a piece! That's how 
my first character got rich.

Orichalcum
Found on: Item Selection Screen, Behemoths and Zus
Cost: 18000 gil*
Can be used to make: Legendary Weapon and stronger weapons, Diamond Armor 
and stronger armor
This has got to be the ultimate metallic material, although I am starting 
to doubt whether this really is a metal, but as the Blacksmiths can play 
with them, I guess it is. Orichalcum is a material that cannot be bought 
from any merchants. Instead, it must be picked up in the field. Even so, 
they are only found on very strong enemies like Behemoths and Zus, both 
with more than 100 HP. If you do not want to bother with those monsters, 
I suggest you try finding a chunk in the Item Selection Screens right after 
you beat a level. Orichalcum appears as golden yellow coloured tetrahedrals 
in the playing field. They are very important as they can be used to craft 
high end weapons and armor. (All weapons and armor stronger than the 
Legendary Weapon and Diamond Armor require Orichalcum.) Orichalcum is also 
a good selling item. You can get a hefty 4500 gil just by selling one chunk!

Bronze Shard
Found on: Many different enemies and merchants
Cost: 100 gil
Can be used to make: Watches
I have absolutely no idea why they would include shards of Bronze even 
if they are available as a whole chunk. My guess is that Bronze Shards 
appear in smaller pieces than a single chunk of Bronze. Bronze Shards are 
rather cheap, as they only cost 100 gil, and can be found on many enemies 
as well. Bronze Shards have much fewer uses than Bronze. After all, they 
can only be used to craft watches, which are the Accurate Watch and the 
Unfaltering Watch, which protect your character against Slow and Stasis 
respectively. Therefore, if you do have those 2 watches, be ready to dump 
this straight away, as they are not good selling items.

Iron Shard
Found on: Many different enemies and merchants
Cost: 100 gil
Can be used to make: Badges
Again, Iron Shards are obviously made of Iron, only that they must have 
been processed and dug out straight from the mines. As they are often full 
of impurities, Iron Shards are a fifth of the price of chunks of Iron. 
Like the Bronze Shard to Bronze, Iron Shards have much fewer uses than 
Iron. They can only be used to craft badges, which are the Flame Badge, 
Thunder Badge and Frost Badge, which protect your charcter against Fire, 
Lightning, and Cold respectively.

Gold
Found on: Many different enemies and the Tipa Merchant
Cost: 500 gil
Can be used to make: Gold Armor, Gold Necklace, Twisted Scopes
Gold has got to be a metal that humans have been craving for since the 
dawn of man. Gold has got to be the most unreactive metal in the world. 
as there are many gold artifacts that still have not been corroded over 
the centuries. Despite its rarity in the real world, gold comes cheap in 
Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles. In fact, only 500 gil are needed to 
buy a bag from the Tipa Merchant. Of course, Gold can be used to make things 
like armor and accessories out of Gold. All of these have one thing in 
common; they protect your character against stone. As for the Twisted Scope, 
it is used to help increase the magic casting range of Clavats.

Silver
Found on: Many different enemies and the Tipa Merchant
Cost: 500 gil
Can be used to make: Various accessories
Silver is another rare and valuable metal, although it can corrode more 
easily than Gold over the years. For some strange reason, Silver is just 
as cheap as Gold in Final Fantasy: Crystal Chorincles. Silver can only 
be used to craft accessories, some include the accessories for women, which 
both require 2 bags of silver to craft, another accessory includes the 
Pixie's Earring for Lilties. Only buy Silver if you need to craft those 
accessories. Otherwise, just dump them.

*****GEMSTONES*****
Ruby
Found on: Many different enemies and Karl Linay
Cost: 200 gil
Can be used to make: Flower Bracer and Dragon's Heart
A Ruby is simply a red coloured gemstone that drives women crazy. The good 
thing is that Rubies come cheap at only 200 gil from Karl Linay the female 
merchant in Leuda. However, Rubies only have 2 uses in Final Fantasy: 
Crystal Chronicles. They can be used to craft the Flower Bracer, an 
accessory for women, and the Dragon's Heart, an accessory for Lilties.

Jade
Found on: Many different enemies and Karl Linay
Cost: 200 gil
Can be used to make: Jade Bracer, Bishop's Soul, Wizard's Soul
Jade is simply a gemstone that is comprised of Chromium (III) ions for 
its green colour. It is known to drive ladies, particularly Orientals crazy, 
and is thought to preserve dead bodies in ancient China. Now, back to the 
game. Jade is cheap here, just buy a piece from Karl Linay for 200 gil 
as well. Jade is particularly useful to women and Yukes, as it can be used 
to craft the Jade Bracer, which offers faster HP regeneration in women, 
as well as the Bishop's Soul and Wizard's Soul, 2 accessories that improve 
the Yukes' magic power.

Diamond Ore
Found on: Slightly stronger enemies in the game
Cost: 3000 gil*
Can be used to make: Diamond Armor
You know what they say, "Diamonds are Forever", at least that's the name 
of the last Bond Movie with Sean Connery starring as James Bond. Of course, 
there is a reason why "Diamonds are Forever". After all, Diamond is the 
hardest substance on Earth, and it can even be used to cut glass, among 
other things. This makes Diamond Ore a good material to make armor. Diamond 
Armor is probably the strongest armor for all tribes excluding the Clavats. 
Diamond Ore can be found early in the game, and there is a reason to keep 
it. Please note that Orichalcum has to be used in conjunction with Diamond 
Ore in order to make Diamond Armor.

Crystal Ball
Found on: Many different enemies and Karl Linay
Cost: 100
Can be used to make: Optical Instruments
No, no, Crystal Balls are not to be used to look into the future, but they 
do have decent refracting properties due to their spherical shape. That 
is why Crystal Balls can easily be carved into lenses for use in optical 
instruments. Each tribe has its own set of optical instruments, which 
either increase their spell casting range or focus attacking range. The 
Clavats have the Twisted Scope, the Lilties have the Power Goggles, the 
Yukes have the Twisted Spectacles while the Selkies have the Eagle Goggles.

Tiny Crystal
Found on: Many different enemies
Cost: 1000 gil*
Can be used to make: Crystal Mail, Crystal Ring, Zeal Headband, Healing 
Headband
Tiny Crystals most likely are small shards of the world's crystal shattered 
by the meteor that crashed into the Earth. Of course, they offer protection 
from the miasma. Therefore, Tiny Crystals can be used to make Crystal Mail 
and Crystal Rings, which can help your character resist miasma. On the 
other hand, this is a nice item to hold on if you are male, as they can 
be used to craft the two accessories for men as stated above.

*****EMBROIDERY KITS*****
Needle
Found on: Cactuars
Cost: 2500 gil*
Can be used to make: Misangas, Charms and Talismans
Needles are just needles. They are one of the most important tools in 
embroidery sets nowadays. Of course, the Needles of Final Fantasy: Crystal 
Chronicles are not made from Iridium, instead, they are just cactus needles. 
To get a needle, you must travel all the way to Lynari Desert, kill some 
Cactuars and they may drop Needles for your use. Needles in this game are 
the materials used in many embroidery products, in particular the Blue 
Misanga, White Misanga, Speed Charm, Speed Talisman, Wisdom Charm and 
Wisdom Talisman.

Blue Silk
Found on: Many different enemies and Karl Linay
Cost: 1000 gil
Can be used to make: Blue Misanga, Zeal Headband
The world of Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles mainly uses one type of 
fabric, and that is silk. First, they obtain the silk, then they dye it 
blue for Blue Silk. Blue Silk can be bought from Karl Linay on Leuda for 
a sum of 1000 gil. Otherwise, you can just go after some enemies like Ghosts 
and they will drop the Blue Silk. Blue Silk can be used to craft the Blue 
Misanga, which can help your character resist poisoning, or the Zeal 
Headband for men, which decreases the Focus Attack Charge Time slightly. 
Now you know when to keep it.

White Silk
Found on: Many different enemies
Cost: 3000 gil*
Can be used to make: White Misanga, Healing Headband
The world of Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles mainly uses one type of 
fabric, and that is silk. First, they obtain the silk, then they dye it 
white for White Silk. There is a reason why White Silk can only be obtained 
by defeating enemies like Ghosts. This is because, White Silk can simply 
be used to make more powerful accessories. One of them is the White Misanga, 
which protects your character against Curse. The other is the Healing 
Headband, which offers male character increased rate of HP Regeneration.

*****ELEMENTAL MATERIALS*****
Magma Rock
Found on: Fire element enemies and merchants
Cost: 1000 gil
Can be used to make: Flame Mail, Flame Badge
The Magma Rock is well, a piece of hot solidified lava. They can be found 
mainly in Mt. Kilanda. On the other hand, Fire element enemies may carry 
Magma Rocks as well. Your prime targets will be the Fire Bombs, Lava Mus, 
Lava Ahrimans and other enemies with the Fire element. The Magma Rock, 
although it can only be used to make 2 items, those 2 items are still very 
important to your character. Both the Flame Mail and Flame Badge are used 
to protect your character from Fire. Finally, Magma Rocks can be bought 
from your local merchant if he has developed good relationships with his 
son/daughter in your caravan.

Chilly Gel
Found on: Ice element enemies and merchants
Cost: 1000 gil
Can be used to make: Frost Mail, Frost Badge
The Chilly Gel is well, some rather cold and gelatinous substance. They 
can be found mainly cold and damp places like Veo Lu Sluice or Conall Curach. 
On the other hand, Ice element enemies may carry Chilly Gel as well. Your 
prime targets will be the Ice Bombs, Snow Mus, Water Flans and other enemies 
with the Ice element. The Chilly Gel, although it can only be used to make 
2 items, those 2 items are still very important to your character. Both 
the Frost Mail and Frost Badge are used to protect your character from 
Cold. Finally, Chilly Gel can be bought from your local merchant if he 
has developed good relationships with his son/daughter in your caravan.

Thunderball
Found on: Electric element enemies and merchants
Cost: 1000 gil
Can be used to make: Lightning Mail, Lightning Badge
No, this is not anything to do with one of those James Bond movies in the 
60s. The Thunderball is some ball with electric charges on it, perhaps. 
They can be found anywhere, as it has nothing to do with the climate. On 
the other hand, Electric element enemies may carry Thunderballs as well. 
Your prime targets will be the Thunder Bombs, Electric Jellyfish and other 
enemies with the Electric element. The Thunderball, although it can only 
be used to make 2 items, those 2 items are still very important to your 
character. Both the Lightning Mail and Lighting Badge are used to protect 
your character from Lightning. Finally, Thunderballs can be bought from 
your local merchant if he has developed good relationships with his 
son/daughter in your caravan.

*****SPOILS FROM ENEMIES*****
Griffin's Wing
Found on: Griffins
Cost: 2000 gil*
Can be used to make: Winged Belt, Eagle Goggles
You know those Griffins, don't you? They are those massive birds that are 
always grounded and cannot fly. When you kill one, it may drop its wing 
for you to retrieve. This item is particularly useful for Selkies as it 
can be used to make the Winged Belt and Eagle Googles, which are an armor 
and an accessory respectively.

Cerberus Fang
Found on: Cerberuses
Cost: 3000 gil*
Can be used to make: Valiant Weapon, Lion's Heart
In this game, the fangs of Cerberuses can be obtained after you kill one. 
Ceberuses are those giant hellhounds you find in Goblin Wall and Rebena 
Te Ra. They are quite tough, but once they die, you may find a Cerberus 
Fang on the ground. It can be used to craft the Valiant Weapon, which is 
not very worthy, or can be used to craft the Lion's Heart, an accessory 
for Lilties.

Worm Antenna
Found on: Carrion Worms
Cost: 2000 gil*
Can be used to make: Time Mail, Time Helm, Accurate Watch
As you can see, there are two types of worms in Final Fantasy: Crystal 
Chronicles. There are Tiny Worms and Carrion Worms. The larger Carrion 
Worms have an antenna big enough for use to craft items. Worm Antennas 
can be used to craft things that can help your character resist Slow, like 
the Time Mail, Time Helm and Accurate Watch.

Faerie's Tear
Found on: Ahrimans and Karl Linay
Cost: 1000 gil
Can be used to make: Pixie's Earring
God knows what a Faerie is, but an Ahriman may carry this weird material. 
So will Karl Linay. These items are only useful for Lilties, as they can 
be used to craft the Pixie's Earring, which only Lilties can use.

Angel's Tear
Found on: Ahrimans and Lava Ahrimans
Cost: 1000 gil*
Can be used to make: Angel's Earring
On the other hand, Ahrimans may also drop Angel's Tears. God knows where 
they can find angels crying. This is only useful for Selkies, as it is 
used to craft the Angel's Earring, which only Selkies can use.

Fiend's Claw:
Found on: Various Enemies and Karl Linay
Cost: 1000 gil
Can be used to make: Daemon's Earring
Different enemies will drop this, as there are no enemies called fiends 
in the game. However, I really cannot remember all the enemies that actually 
have it! To be certain, go to Leuda and buy one from Karl Linay for 1000 
gil. This is used to make the Daemon's Earring only.

Ogre Fang
Found on: Ogres
Cost: 2500 gil*
Can be used to make: Victorious Weapon
Whenever you see an Ogre, you will be able to see two walrus like teeth 
sticking out. When you kill him, you may be able to take his fang! Ogre 
Fangs are pretty much useless in this game, as they only can be used to 
forge the Victorious Weapon, which is not a substantial improvement over 
the Master's Weapon. Therefore, just sell them for 625 gil apiece whenever 
you find one.

Holy Water
Found on: Wraiths and Karl Linay
Cost: 1000 gil
Can be used to make: Blessed Mail, Blessed Sash
If I had not mistaken, Holy Water used to be a healing item in Final Fantasy 
X. But now, it is used to craft materials in this game. Holy Water can 
be found on Wraiths in Daemon's Court, or it can be bought from Karl Linay 
for 1000 gil a piece. Holy Water can be used to craft Blessed Mail and 
the Blessed Sash, which protects your character from poisoning.

Heavenly Dust
Found on: Wriaths and Karl Linay
Cost: 1000 gil
Can be used to make: Saintly Shield, Saintly Mail
Heavenly Dust is another material that can be found on Wriaths or bought 
from Karl Linay. This time, it can be used to make Saintly Mail and Saintly 
Shields, which both protects your character against curses.

Hard Shell
Found on: Blazer Beetles
Cost: 2000 gil*
Can be used to make: Diamond Armor
What do beetles have? That's right, they have hard shells, and that is 
what you may get when you defeat a Blazer Beetle. Yes, although there is 
only one use for the Hard Shells, it is NOT useless. After all, Diamond 
Armor requires a Hard Shell in order to be forged. So be prepared.

Gigas Claw
Found on: Gigas
Cost: 2500 gil*
Can be used to make: Speed Charm
A Gigas is basically the minature field version of Jack Moschet. Their 
claws are useful to Selkies only, as they can be used to craft the Speed 
Charm, which only Selkies can be equipped with.

Cockatrice Scale
Found on: Cockatrices
Cost: 2000 gil*
Can be used to make: Gold Necklace, Gold Armlets
Cockatrices are yet another type of bird like creature. Their body is so 
covered with scales that they will drop one of them when they are killed. 
It seems that Cockatrice Scales are to be used in conjunction with Gold 
all the time, as they can only be used to craft Gold Necklaces and Gold 
Armlets.

Coeurl Whisker
Found on: Coeurls
Cost: 2000 gil*
Can be used to make: Wizard's Soul, Wisdom Charm, Rune Shield
You know those yellow dog like creatures that cast spells on you? Well, 
they are Coeurls. It's amazing that even dogs can have whiskers. Because 
there is so much magic in those Whiskers, the Coeurl Whiskers can be used 
to craft accessories that can improve your character's magic abilities 
like the Wizard's Soul, Wisdom Charm and the Rune Shield.

Gear
Found on: Skeletons
Cost: 1000 gil*
Can be used to make: Accurate Watch, Unfaltering Watch
You know what gears are? They are just cogs that keep the mechanisms inside 
clocks and other machines running. Of course, the only machines your 
characters will be using are the Accurate Watch and the Unfaltering Watch, 
and that's what you need Gears for. I have no idea why you may find Gears 
on skeletons. Maybe it is because they are mechanical skeletons.

Jagged Scythe
Found on: Abbadons
Cost: 4000 gil*
Can be used to make: Mighty Weapon
An abbadon has 2 claws, both with Jagged Scythes. Whenever you kill one, 
they may drop a Jagged Scuthe for you to collect. However, Jagged Scythes 
are not very useful, as they can only be used to forge the Mighty Weapon. 
I would rather sell these instead. You can get 1000 gil from selling each 
of them. Which is not bad.

Yellow Feather
Found on: Tonberry Chefs
Cost: 4000 gil*
Can be used to make: Chocobo Shield
My personal guess is that Tonberry Chefs of Moschet Manor wear Yellow 
Feathers for decoration. However, if you are a Clavat, this tiny little 
feather is not to be underestimated, as it can be used to forge the Chocobo 
Shield, which is the most powerful secondary armor in the game. However, 
if you are not a Clavat, it is still worth keeping because of its sell 
value of 1000 gil.

Toad Oil
Found on: Gigan Toads
Cost: 2000 gil*
Can be used to make: Eternal Mail, Eternal Helm, Unfaltering Watch
Well, it seems that many toads have skins with rather poisonous secretions, 
and the Gigan Toads are not an exception. The only thing different is that 
they secret some rather useful and non-poisonous oils which can be used 
to make armor and accessories that help protect your character against 
Stasis. The Eternal Mail, Eternal Helm and Unfaltering Watch are the uses.

Devil's Claw
Found on: Nightmares
Cost: 3000 gil*
Can be used to make: Devil's Earring
Well, there really are no devils in this game, just their claws, and they 
are found on those evil horses called Nightmares in Rebena Te Ra. There 
really is only one use for this material, and it is only for Clavats. IT 
can be used to make the Devil's earring. How evil are the Clavats!

Zu's Beak
Found on: Zus
Cost: 3000 gil*
Can be used to make: Speed Talisman
It is obvious isn't it? Zu's beaks belong to Zus, which can only be found 
in the Lynari Desert. There really is only ONE use for the Zu's Beak, and 
that is to make the Speed Talisman, who only Selkies can use. Otherwise, 
be prepared to dump this useless material at a merchant near you.

Chimera's Horn
Found on: Chimeras
Cost: 2500 gil*
Can be used to make: Dragoon's Spear, Twisted Scope, Wisdom Talisman
This is well, the horn of a Chimera, which again can only be found in the 
Lynari Desert unless you would like to go all the way to Mount Vellenge. 
There are a couple of uses for a Chimera's Horn, only that it is most useful 
for Clavats, as it can craft them 2 of their accessories.

*****SPOILS FROM BOSSES*****
Ancient Sword
Found on: Giant Crab (~150 points)
Cost: 30000 gil*
Can be used to make: Ragnarok
When you battle the Giant Crab, you may find that he has a triceratops 
style horn on his head. Stuck on the horn is some kind of sword. That is 
the Ancient Sword. I guess that once you have knocked his horn off, the 
Ancient Sword must have flown into the bushes without being broken. If 
you get somewhere around 150 bonus points, then your character may be able 
to salvage it. However, the Ancient Sword is only useful for Clavats, as 
it can be used to forge their Dark Weapon. The Ragnarok.

Cursed Crook
Found on: Goblin King (~198 points)
Cost: 30000 gil*
Can be used to make: Ragnarok, Bishop's Soul
When you fought the Goblin King of Goblin Wall, you will notice that the 
Goblin King is holding some kind of a magic staff that he uses to cast 
various kinds of spells on you. That is the Cursed Crook. The Cursed Crook 
is found in the Power Set of Goblin Wall, and to be able to select it, 
you should get around (~198 points) in the level in order to have a 25% 
chance of being able to select it. The Cursed Crook is useful to Clavats, 
as it can also be used to forge the Ragnarok, and it is also useful for 
Yukes, as it can be used to craft the Bishop's Soul.

Malboro Seed
Found on: Malboro (~189 points)
Cost: 30000 gil*
Can be used to make: Elemental's Soul
The Malboro is a giant mutant plant in the Mushroom Forest, and it has 
a stock of seeds hidden deep inside its body. If you do defeat it and get 
around 189 points, you may be able to have the honour of dissecting and 
anatomizing the Malboro, and finding its seed! However, this seed is only 
useful to Yukes, as it is used to craft an accessory for them called the 
Elemental's Soul. If you are of any other race, ignore the seed.

Orc Belt
Found on: Orc King (~218 points)
Cost: 30000 gil*
Can be used to make: Dragon's Heart, Thief's Emblem
When you first meet the Orc King in the Mine of Carthuiges, you will notive 
that he is wearing a rather large and wide belt around his waist, and that 
is his Orc Belt. If your character beats him while gaining around 218 bonus 
points, then you may be able to strip the Orc King's belt and use it for 
your own! (Amazing that you can carry such a heavy belt.) However, the 
Orc Belt is only useful for the Lilties and Selkies, as it can be used 
to craft the Dragon's Heart for Lilties and the Thief's Emblem for the 
Selkies.

Wind Crystal
Found on: Cave Worm (~218 points)
Cost: 30000 gil*
Can be used to make: Dreamcatcher, Thief's Emblem
I have no idea how this has anything got to do with a Cave Worm. My guess 
is that it is found inside the Cave Worm, and allows him to generate winds 
by inhaling and exhaling air. If you get around 218 bonus points upon 
beating the Cave Worm, then you will get to anatomize it and get its Wind 
Crystal. However, this crystal is only useful to Selkies, as it is used 
to forge the Dreamcatcher and the Thief's Emblem, which are a weapon and 
an accessory for Selkies respectively.

King's Scale
Found on: Lizardman King (~130 points)
Cost: 30000 gil*
Can be used to make: Gaia Plate
The Lizardman King of Daemon's Court really does have such large scales. 
If you beat him inside the colloseum with around 130 points, then you can 
get a free scale off him as a souvenir. However, besides being a selling 
item, the King's Scale is only useful for Clavats, as it can be used to 
forge their Earth Armor, which is their Gaia Plate.

Dweomer Spore:
Found on: Armstrong (~213 points)
Cost: 30000 gil*
Can be used to make: Elemental's Soul
Armstrong is some kind of live building sort of boss found in Tida. But 
for some strange reason, Armstrong also exhibits some plant properties. 
In fact, he can give out spores. If you beat him with around 213 points, 
then you will have a 25% chance of salvaging a spore from him. This spore 
really is expernsive, but is only useful for Yukes, as it can only be used 
to craft the Elemental's Soul, an accessory for Yukes.

Lord's Robe
Found on: Gigas Lord (~130 points)
Cost: 30000 gil*
Can be used to make: Gaia Plate
As you can see, Jack Moschet of the Moschet Manor is always wearing 
something that looks like a bathrobe. That is the Gigas Robe. If you can 
defeat him with around 130 points, then you can get to strip him of his 
robe at his home! However, this souvenir is only useful to Clavats, as 
it is one of the 3 materials used to forge the Earth Armor of the Clavats, 
which is the Gaia Plate, the strongest armor in the game.

Green Sphere
Found on: Golem (~120 points)
Cost: 30000 gil*
Can be used to make: Thief's Emblem
You will notice that the Golem will have some kind of sphere in the center 
of his body which I guess will show its emotions. It is usually green, 
and it can turn red if the Golem is angry. When you have beaten the Golem 
with around 120 bonus points, you may be able to salvage the Green Sphere 
of the Golem's body. However, this sphere is only useful to Selkies only, 
as it is used to raft an accessory for them called the Thief's Emblem.

Dragon Fang
Found on: Dragon Zombie (~261 points)
Cost: 30000 gil*
Can be used to make: Dragoon's Spear, Longinus, Dragon's Heart
Although the Dragon Zombie is rather undead, its fangs are still real. 
If you defeat the Dragon Zombie with around 261 points, then you may get 
to salvage a Dragon Fang after he disappears. However, it really is only 
useful for Lilties, as it can be used to craft 3 things, the Dragoon's 
Spear, Longinous and the Dragon's Heart accessory, that can only be used 
by Lilties. Otherwise, it's useless.

Ethereal Orb
Found on: Lich (~207 points)
Cost: 30000 gil*
Can be used to make: Elemental's Soul
I have no idea what this is. My guess is that it is one of those balls 
on poles in the room where you fight the Lich in Rebena Te Ra. If you defeat 
the Lich with about 207 points, then you may get to choose this on the 
Item Selection Screen. This material is only useful for Yukes, as it can 
only be used to craft the Elemental's Soul, which only Yukes can use.

Red Eye
Found on: Iron Giant (~177 points)
Cost: 30000 gil*
Can be used to make: Longinus
The Iron Giant has 2 eyes that are rather red. If you can beat him with 
around 177 points, then your character has a 25% chance of being able to 
pluck the eye straight from his metallic socket and use it as a material. 
As for usefulness, I must say that it is very useful to Lilties only. This 
is because it can be used to craft the Celestial Weapon for the Lities, 
which is the Longinus. Otherwise, simply ignore this booty.

Desert Fang
Found on: Antlion (~180 points)
Cost: 30000 gil*
Can be used to make: Dreamcatcher
The Desert Fang has 2 gigantic fangs sticking out of his mouth for him 
to bite your character with, and when you beat him with about 180 bonus 
points, your character may get to choose this fang in the Item Selection 
Screen. God knows how he/she can carry it. Anyway, this fang is only useful 
to Selkies only, as it can only be used to forge the Dreamcatcher, which 
is the Lunar Weapon of the Selkies.

*****MATERIALS FOR ONE GENDER*****
Pressed Flower
Found on: Sahagin Lord??
Cost: 1000 gil*
Can be used to make: Flower Bracer, Jade Bracer
This has got to be the material that is for women only. This is because 
it is used to craft two accessories which are for women, and hence are 
no use for men. Pressed Flowers can appear anywhere, but I only have picked 
them up from Sahagin Lords in Conall Curach or have received them via mail. 
My guess is that women love things poetic, and that flowers are just the 
delicate and poetic stuff that women and girls like!

Remedy
Found on: Sahagin Lord??
Cost: 1000 gil*
Can be used to make: Zeal Headband, Healing Headband
This has got to be the material that is for men only. This is because it 
is used to craft two accessories which are for men, and hence are no use 
for women. Remedies can appear anywhere, but I only have picked them up 
from Sahagin Lords in Conall Curach or have received them via mail. My 
guess is that men are sporty types of people, and in such hectic times, 
they would need stuff to help them relax and replenish their body fluids 
and so on, and remedies can help them in recovering from those various 
ailments!!

*****ULTIMATE MATERIALS*****
Ultimite
Found on: Local Merchant
Cost: 50000 gil
Can be used to make: Ultimate Weapon
The sole purpose of this horrendously overpriced material is to forge the 
Ultimate Weapon, which is usually not the best weapon when compared to 
other powerful weapons like the Longinus, Dreamcatcher or Ragnarok.

Dark Sphere
Found on: Local Merchant
Cost: 50000 gil
Can be used to make: Force Ring
The sole purpose of this horrendously overpriced material is to craft the 
Force Ring, which only protects your character against knock backs, and 
this is not worth it as well.

f. Designs [A2F]
-----------------
Recently, I have received an e-mail from someone who told me that I should 
add an individual list that shows the locations of the designs of the game,

the game.

the design from Karl Linay.

Victorious Weapon
