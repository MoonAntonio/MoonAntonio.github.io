           FINAL FANTASY VI GAME SCRIPT
           FINAL Version

           Completed/Last Updated:  June 7th, 2003

I don't know about you, but this game is one of my favorites of all time. I 
originally had the idea of writing a walkthrough for it, but there are already
too many good ones out there. I wanted to do something that had never been 
done before. So, when playing through for the zillionth (well, actually only 
about the seventh) time and watching the opera scene, (which is my favorite 
scene in a video game full stop), and I actually found myself singing along to
the tune *gasp*, I realized that I love the script of this game, and I 
also love a lot of the conversations that go on. (Like "Mr. Thou".) So I 
decided to make a game script, of everything that goes on in the game.

Enjoy!



Thanks go out to: 
--> The unknown person at my mother's school who sold me this game for an 
entire $2. Best $2 I ever spent.
--> Steve McFadden aka Psycho Penguin for motivating me to keep working on 
this guide, after I had just about given up on it as a pointless exercise. 
Also for being everything I want in a man, for loving me, putting up with me, 
looking after me. I love you, Steve.

1. NARSHE
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Long ago, the War of the Magi reduced the world to a scorched wasteland, and 
Magic simply ceased to exist. 1000 years have passed... Iron, gunpowder and 
steam engines have been rediscovered, and high technology reigns. But there 
are those who would enslave the world by reviving the dread destructive power 
known as "Magic". Can it be that those in power are on the verge of repeating 
a senseless and deadly mistake?

Biggs:     There's the town...
Wedge:     Hard to believe an Esper's been found intact there, 1000 years 
           after the War of the Magi...
Biggs:     Think it's still alive?
Wedge:     Probably... judging from the urgency of our orders.
Biggs:     And this woman, this... sorceress, why's she here? I heard she 
           fried 50 of our Magitek Armoured soldiers in under 3 minutes!
Wedge:     Not to worry. The Slave Crown on her head robs her of all conscious
           thought. She'll follow orders.
Biggs:     We'll approach from the east. Move out!

Wedge:     Let's put her on point. No sense in taking any risks. Forward!

Guard:     Imperial Magitek armour? Not even Narshe's safe anymore!

Guard:     Narshe's freedom depends on us!

Guard:     We've got 'em trapped, now!

Guard:     We must defend the mines!

Wedge:     According to our source, the frozen Esper was found in a new mine 
           shaft... Maybe this one...

Biggs:     I'll handle this. Stand back!

Guard:     We won't hand over the Esper!
Guard:     Whelk! Get them!

Biggs:     Hold it! Think back to our briefing...
Wedge:     What about it!?
Biggs:     Do you recall hearing about a monster that eats lightning...
Wedge:     ... and stores the energy in it's shell!
Biggs:     Right. So whatever you do, don't attack the shell!
Wedge:     Alright already!

Wedge:     Hey! What's the matter? Do you know something we don't...?
Girl:      ...
Wedge:     Where's that light coming from!? Uwaaaaaaa!!!!
Biggs:     Hey! Wedge... where are you? W... what's happening!?
Girl:      ... ... ...

Girl:      Where am I...?
Old man:   Whoa! And I only just removed your crown!
Girl:      ...head... hurts...
Old man:   Easy! This is a Slave Crown. The others had complete control over 
           you while you were wearing it.
Girl:      I can't remember a thing...
Old man:   Don't worry. It'll all come back to you... in time, that is.

     "A mysterious young woman, controlled by the Empire, and born with the 
     gift of Magic......"

Girl:      My name... ...is... Terra...
Old man:   Impressive! I've never heard of anyone recovering this fast...!
Soldier:   Open up! Give us back the girl and the Empire's Magitek Armor!
Soldier:   Open this door! We want that girl! She's an officer of the Empire!
Terra:     Empire...? Magitek Armor...?
Old man:   Look, I have to get you out of here! I don't have time to explain!
Old man:   Over here!
Old man:   Make your way out through the mines! I'll keep these brutes 
           occupied!

She's up there!

Guard:     Got her!

Kefka:     My sweet little Magic user...! Uweee... he... he! With this Slave 
           Crown I'll practically OWN you!!
Kefka:     Uwee, hee, hee! Good! Burn up everything!

Gestahl:   We stand on the brink of a major breakthrough! In the days to come,
           we'll witness a total revival of Magic!
Gestahl:   It is our destiny, and ours alone, to take this mystic force and 
           claim what is rightfully ours!
Gestahl:   With our new-found power, nothing can stand in our way!
Hurrah!!! Long live Emperor Gestahl!!!

Old man:   Took you long enough! How goes the robbing and plundering trade?

     "Treasure Hunter and trail-worn traveler, searching the world over for 
     relics of the past..."

Locke:     I PREFER the term "Treasure Hunter!"
Old man:   Ha! Semantic nonsense!
Locke:     There's a HUGE difference!
Locke:     Anyway, were you the one who sent for me?
Old man:   Yeah. There's a girl I'd like you to meet.
Locke:     ......!? This better not have anything to do with that Magitek-
           riding, Imperial witch!!!
Old man:   Imperial troops are pursuing her even as we speak. This town is no 
           match for the Empire. Our independence can only be assured if we 
           join forces with the Returners, an underground resistance movement.
           That girl wasn't responsible for her actions. We must get her to 
           understand our dilemma!
Locke:     All right... I think we'd better help her...
Old man:   Agreed. Make your way first to Figaro, and talk to the king.

Guard:     Now we gotcha!
Locke:     Wonderful... there's a whole bunch of 'em...
Kupo...
Locke:     Moogles...! Are you saying you want to help me?
Kupo!!!

Locke:     Thanks Moogles! We're in your debt!

Locke:     I think this switch will...
Locke:     Eh? You back with us now!?
Terra:     You... saved me?
Locke:     Save your thanks for the Moogles!
Terra:     Uhh... I can't remember anything... past or present...
Locke:     You have amnesia!?
Terra:     A man said my memory would come back...
Locke:     Give it time. You're safe with me! I give you my word!
Terra:     ???
Locke:     I won't leave you until your memory returns! By the way, this 
           secret entrance might be useful someday. Don't forget about it!

2. FIGARO
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Wait! Hey! Oh, it's you. Proceed.

Man:       You mean, THIS young woman...!?
Terra:     Who do you think you are?
Man:       Oh... sorry!
Man:       How rude of me to turn my back to a lady!

     "The young king of Figaro Castle, ally to the Empire, and a master 
     designer of machinery..."

Edgar:     I am Edgar, King of Figaro.
Locke:     Surprised someone like me knows a king?
Locke:     Talk to you later!
Edgar:     So... you're an Imperial soldier! No problem. Figaro and the Empire
           are allies! Please relax while you're here. It's not in my blood to
           harm a lady.
Terra:     Look, why are you helping me? Is it because of my... abilities?
Edgar:     I'll give you three reasons: First of all, your beauty has 
           captivated me! Second... I'm dying to know if I'm your type... I 
           guess your ...abilities... would be a distant third.
Terra:     ... ...? What's with you, anyway?
Edgar:     Guess my technique's a bit rusty...
Terra:     Hmmm... I suppose a normal girl would have found him dashing. But 
           I'm hardly... normal...

Matron:    Edgar has a twin brother. He was such a nice boy...

Youth:     Brother, what's wrong with father? What's all this talk of his 
           successor?
Edgar:     Are you blind? Look how thin his face has become!
Youth:     ? ...... What is it?
Youth:     Brother!
Youth:     Tears......!?

     "Edgar's twin brother, who traded the throne for his own freedom..."

Matron:    Yes... his name is Sabin. Oh, he looked so like his father! When he
           ran away, he was a sweet little child. I wonder what he's like now?

Edgar:     Well? How do you like my castle?
King Edgar! Someone from the Empire to see you!
Edgar:     Probably Kefka!

Kefka:     Phooey! Emperor Gestahl's stupid orders! 
Kefka:     Edgar, you pinhead! Why do you have to live in the middle of 
           nowhere? These recon jobs are the pits!
Kefka:     Ahem... there's SAND on my boots!
Soldiers:  Yes, Sir! All set, Sir!
Kefka:     Idiots!
Sir Kefka!? What on earth do...
Kefka:     Outta my way!

Edgar:     What brings Kefka, humble servant of Emperor Gestahl, into our 
           lowly presence?
Kefka:     A girl of no importance recently escaped from us. We heard she 
           found refuge here...
Edgar:     Hmmm... this wouldn't have anything to do with this "witch" every
           one's been whispering about, would it?
Kefka:     Lies! She... merely stole something of minor value. Is she here?
Edgar:     That's a tough one!
Edgar:     You see, there are more girls here than grains of sand out there. I
           can't keep track of 'em all!
Kefka:     I'd hate to be you if we find out you're lying... Mwa, ha!
Kefka:     I truly hope nothing happens to your precious Figaro...!

Locke:     I'd say that guy's missing a few buttons...
Edgar:     ... Where's Terra?
Edgar:     Take her to her room...
Edgar:     I'd love to chat with you, but the Chancellor and I must plan our 
           strategy. Sometimes I hate being a king! If you'll excuse me.
Locke:     Follow me.

Locke:     Don't you worry 'bout a thing! I'll...
Terra:     You're Locke, right? Edgar told me about you. Is it true you're a 
           thief?
Locke:     That's TREASURE HUNTER!
Locke:     On the surface, Edgar pretends to support the Empire. The truth is,
           he's collaborating with the Returners, an organization opposed to 
           the Empire. I am his contact with that group...
Locke:     The old man you met in Narshe is one of us.
Terra:     Empire... but I'm a soldier of the Empire...!
Locke:     That's not true! They were using you! Things are different now.
Terra:     I don't understand... what should I do?
Locke:     I can't tell you what to do. You don't have to decide right now. 
           You'll soon find your way...
Terra:     But how will I know which way is right...

Edgar:     ...? What the...!?
Edgar:     What's happening?
Soldier:   It's the Empire! It's Kefka!
Edgar:     What are you doing?
Kefka:     Bring me the girl. Now!
Edgar:     I don't know what you're talking about!
Kefka:     Then... welcome to my barbecue! Uwa ha ha ha!

Edgar:     Get ready...!
Soldier:   Yes, Sir!
Kefka:     Changed your mind...?
Edgar:     I guess I have no choice...
Edgar:     Or maybe I do!
Kefka:     Ackk! Shameful that a king should flee, leaving his people behind! 
           How utterly delightful!
Edgar:     Jump!
Edgar:     OK! Dive now!!!
Locke:     Yahoooo!

Figaro Submerge Mode initiated!
Chancellor: No-one can defeat the people of Figaro!

Kefka:     Go!! GET THEM!

Locke:     Edgar, what's the matter? You look positively spooked!
Edgar:     Ddddddddid you just see what I saw...?
Locke:     Yeah... this kid seems loaded for bear...
Edgar:     She's amazing! That was magic! MAGIC!
Locke:     M M M M M M MAGIC!? She used magic?
Edgar Locke:	Pswswswsw! Pswswswsw!!
Edgar:     Terra... where on earth did you learn that?
Terra:     ... Sorry... I... um...
Locke:     Look, I didn't mean to make such a big deal of this...
Edgar:     Me either... It's just that I've never actually SEEN magic before! 
           Where did you...?
Terra:     ... 
Locke:     Edgar, Terra can use magic, and we can't. That's the only 
           difference between us. The fact is... we could use her help!
Terra:     Thank you, Locke!
Terra:     Thank you, Edgar!
Terra:     Stop swooning, you two!

Edgar:     Bravo, Figaro!!
Kefka:     Son of a submariner! They'll pay for this...

Locke:     This is great!
Terra:     Was that a bad person? I... I'm scared...
Edgar:     Terra, there's someone I'd like you to meet...!
Locke:     We're members of the Returners.
Edgar:     Our mentor, Banon, would certainly like to meet you. "Magic" is 
           going to be the key to winning this war.
Terra:     "Magic"...
Edgar:     Terra has magical powers. That Esper seemed to... react to her. Can
           there be some connection?
Terra:     I haven't the foggiest! It just seems natural to me that I have use
           of this power...
Edgar:     But no HUMAN is born with the powers you seem to have, and...
Edgar:     I apologize.
Terra:     What should I do...?
Edgar:     I'm sure the Empire is going to come after you... If they get their
           hands on you, the world's finished... Terra, you want to understand
           your own powers, right?
Edgar:     Then I think we need to consult with Banon.
Terra:     ......
Locke:     Please...
Edgar:     OK! To the south there's a cave that leads to South Figaro.

3. FIGARO CAVE
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Soldier:   King Edgar! Where are you headed?
Edgar:	   Through the cave, and eastward to South Figaro.
Edgar:	   Return to the castle, and tell the others we’re safe.
Soldier:   Yes, Sir! Take care!

4. SOUTH FIGARO

...
Locke:     At the very least you could give me a response...
Edgar:	   Stand back! He seems vaguely familiar... Wait a minute...!

     "He owes allegiance to no-one, and will do anything for money. He comes 
     and goes like the wind..."

Edgar:	   That’s Shadow...! He’d slit his mama’s throat for a nickel!
Locke:	   Better steer clear of him, I guess.

5. MT. KOLTS
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Vargas:    Sabin sent you, right?
Locke:	   Who’re YOU?
Edgar:	   Sabin? Is he here?
Locke:	   You were shadowing us earlier, right?
Vargas:	   Brilliant!
Vargas:	   And how unlucky it is that you have run into me...!

Enough!! Off with ya now!!
Give it up, Vargas!
Vargas:	   Is that you, Sabin!?
Sabin:	   Vargas, why’d you do it? How could you do your own father in like 
           that!?
Vargas:	   Fool! He made the mistake of choosing you as his successor! He 
           snubbed me, his only son!
Sabin:	   No! You were the one he chose!
Vargas:	   You’re a liar!
Sabin:	   Our Master wanted you to be his successor, not me. He appreciated 
           your fine spirit...
Vargas:    Enough of your lies! Now, have a taste of my superior technique!
Mortal Attack! Blizzard Fist!
Vargas:	   Ahh, Sabin! The master taught you well!
Sabin:	   I guess there’s no avoiding this!
Vargas:	   Fate made us train together, and fate will send you to your doom!
Phew... I tire of this!
Come on! Whats the matter?
Vargas:	   Time to put an end to this!
Sabin:	   The Master’s teachings... Must use a Blitz technique...
Vargas:	   W...what the...!? He... already taught you that!?
Sabin:	   If only you hadn’t been in such a rush for power...

Edgar:	   Sabin!!!
Sabin:	   Big brother?
Locke:	   The brothers are reunited!
Terra:	   Younger... "brother?" At first glance I thought he was some body
           builder who had strayed from his gym...
Sabin:	   Bodybuilder!?
Sabin:	   I’ll... take that as a compliment...
Sabin:	   Anyway, brother, what are you doing here?
Edgar:	   We’re on the way to the... Sabil mountains.
Sabin: 	   To the Returner’s hideout, no doubt?
Sabin:	   I’ve been watching from afar, hoping the world might regain some 
           sanity... At this rate, Figaro will be reduced to a puppet state.
Edgar:     Our time to strike back has arrived. The Empire’s going to pay for 
           what it has done...
Sabin:	   Think a "bear" like me could help you in your fight?
Edgar:	   You’d... join us? Sabin...!!
Sabin:	   I think Duncan would rest easier if he knew his disciple played a 
           part in bringing peace to the world.
Locke:	   Let’s get going!



=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
6. RETURNER’S HIDEOUT
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

King Edgar! This way, please!

Edgar:	   Banon! We brought the girl with us.
Banon:	   Is she the girl who can talk to Espers...!?
Terra:     Espers...?
Edgar:	   Seemed the Empire had complete control over her.
Banon:	   Carrier pigeons brought word that she wiped out 50 of the Empire’s 
           best soldiers in a few minutes.
Terra:	   That’s a lie!!!
Locke:	   Terra!
Edgar:	   Banon! She doesn’t remember ANYTHING!
Banon:	   Stay where you are!
Banon:	   Perhaps you’ve heard this story? Once, when people were pure and 
           innocent, there was a box they were told never to open. But someone
           went and opened it anyway. He unleashed all the Evils of the world:
           Envy... Greed... Pride... Violence... Control... All that was left 
           in the box was a single ray of light: Hope.
Terra: 	   ...
Banon:	   We now confront those evils... And you are that last ray of light, 
           our only hope...
Edgar:	   Banon!
Banon:	   I’m so tired... Let me rest a while.

Edgar: 	   It’s gonna be tough to talk you into helping us... If we push you 
           too hard, we’re no different from the Empire... So we want you to 
           make up your own mind.

Sabin:	   The only thing I can add is that you can trust my brother 
           implicitly. He’s always been fair with me. You can trust him, 
           Terra... But don’t you DARE tell him I said that!

Locke:	   Someone important to me was jailed by the Empire. I’ve hated the 
           Empire ever since... I joined the Returners when I realized the 
           Empire was rotten to the core. I wanted to make a difference.
Terra:	   But... I have no significant "other" in my life...
Locke:	   That’s not entirely true. Besides, I’m sure there are people who 
           feel YOU’RE important to them! They are counting on you...

Banon? He went outside a moment ago.

Banon:	   Have you made a decision? Will you become our last ray of hope?
Banon:	   You will? Really!!!
Terra:	   But... I’m scared...
Banon:	   If everyone works together we’ll be successful. Never give up hope!
Banon:	   I have a plan. Please get everyone together!

Banon:	   Right...
Banon:	   We all know that the Empire is using Magitek power in battle. The 
           point is, how has the Emperor created it?
Edgar:	   I had Locke look into the rumour that the Empire is forcing the 
           world’s finest scholars to study Espers.
Locke:	   All the trouble in Narshe is over an Esper, too...
Terra:	   You mean there’s some connection between Espers and Magitek?
Banon:	   I can only recall one thing linking Espers with Magitek power...
Edgar:	   You don’t mean...
Banon:	   Indeed! The ancient War of the Magi...
"No!" "It can’t be!"
Locke:	   My Grandma used to tell me stories about magical machines... Could 
           they have been true?
Edgar:	   Could that ancient tragedy be playing out once again...
Banon:	   It’s just speculation... But historical studies have provided a 
           number of conflicting and frightening theories... According to one 
           theory, humans and machines were imbued with powers drained from 
           Espers...
Terra:	   That could explain Magitek power...
Edgar:	   We can only fight Magitek enemies with Magitek weapons...
Banon:	   It’s risky, but if we have Terra... speak with that Esper, it might
           just wake up...
Edgar:	   I wonder if that’s wise...?
Banon:	   Who can say? Regardless, we need Terra’s help.
Locke:	   Terra...
Terra:	   I’ll do it!
Sabin:	   What nonsense! You sound as if you’re enjoying this!
Banon:	   What? What’s that noise?
Emergency! Sir Banon...

Banon:	   They’ve found us... We haven’t a moment to lose!
Edgar:	   Locke!
Locke:	   I know... "Someone" has to sneak into South Figaro and slow the 
           Empire down, right?
Edgar:	   This is right up your alley! Good luck!
Locke: 	   Terra... Please wait for me... And... please... don’t let a 
           lecherous young king, who shall remain nameless, near you!
Edgar:	   Locke!!!
Sabin:	   Big brother... Aren’t you EVER going to grow up?
Banon:	   What’re we going to do?
Edgar:	   We’ll escape down the Lete River, and make our way to Narshe. I 
           want to see that Esper for myself...
Banon:	   Right. There’s a raft by the back entrance. It’s a gamble, but 
           we’re fresh out of options...
Edgar:	   You’re in danger here. Come with us to Narshe. You’ll probably even
           gain some understanding of your own abilities...
Banon:	   We’ve no time to dilly-dally. Let’s make for Narshe!

Here we go! This raft will take us to Narshe!

Yaaooouch! Seafood soup!
Delicious morsel... Let me get my bib!
Muscle-heads? Hate ‘em!
Th... that’s all, friends!

Sabin:	   I guess we thrashed it.
Edgar:	   Don’t bet on it... It’s probably just hiding from us...
Terra: 	   Ewww!!! Something’s stuck to my leg!
Edgar:	   Terra! Over here!
Banon:	   It’s all right now.
Sabin:	   Watch out! I’m going to hit it with a Blitz!
Edgar:	   No! Sabin!!
Sabin:	   Don’t distract me, brother!!
Edgar:	   He’s always been a tad zealous...
Terra:	   Sabin...!!!
Banon:	   Don’t worry about him!
Edgar:	   Are you sure he’s okay, Banon?
Banon:	   You should know better than any of us! Any moment he’ll flop right 
           onto the raft!
Sabin:	   What the...?
Banon:	   ... ...
Edgar:	   Seems a little too perky... Ha...!
Terra:	   Sabin!!!!!

Locke:	   Nuts! Gotta get to Narshe on the fly...

Merchant:  You’re that thief, Locke, aren’t you?
Locke:	   Hey! Call me a Treasure Hunter, or I’ll rip your lungs out!
Locke:	   Here we go! These are a little tight, but the price was right.
Wh... whew!!
Merchant:  Sorry!

My grandfather was a servant for the richest man in town. Merchant, right? You
may proceed.

Scram, you blockhead.
Locke:	   Here we go! These are a little too big, but they’ll do.

Hey you! Come to steal my cider? You thief!
Locke:     Here we go! These are a little tight, but the price was right.
Wh... whew!!
Took the old man’s cider!

My grandfather was a servant for the richest man in town. Merchant, right? You
may proceed.

Ah! Cider! Glug, glug, ... Huh? Secret passage? Well, there is one that leads 
to the rich man’s house. Go downstairs and give my grandson the password. 
It’s... uh, umm... I forget!

Locke:     I’ve seen her before... Of course! She’s one of the Empire’s 
           generals!
Guard:	   This’s what happens to traitors!

     "Product of genetic engineering, battle-hardened Magitek Knight with a 
     spirit as pure as snow..."

Guard:	   So, the mighty Celes has fallen!
Celes:	   How can you serve those cowards...
Guard:	   Hold your tongue!
Celes:	   Isn’t it true Kefka’s going to poison the people of Doma, to the 
           east?
Guard:	   Shuddap!
Guard:	   I’d hate to be in your shoes tomorrow! Keep a close eye on her.
Yes, Sir! I can go for days without sleep!

Celes:	   What do you hope to peddle down here?
Locke:	   Oops! Forgot I was wearing these clothes.
Locke:	   I’m with the Returners. Name’s Locke.
Celes:	   Returners!!! I used to be General Celes... Now I’m just a common 
           traitor...
Locke:	   Let’s go!
Celes:	   !? You’d take me along?
Celes:	   Thanks, but no thanks. I can barely walk...
Celes:	   I’m grateful, but... Even if you got me out, you’d never be able to
           protect me. No, I think I’m better off here.
Locke:	   I’ll protect you!
Locke:	   Trust me! You’ll be fine!
Locke:	   Let’s go!
Celes:	   Wait.
Celes:	   This soldier has something important on him...

Zzz... zzz...
There’s a clock key in his pocket...
Soldier:   ...’n some bread too... mumble mumble...

Celes:	   Why are you helping me?
Locke:	   You remind me of someone...
Locke:	   But what’s it matter anyway? I just want to, okay!?

Locke:	   Huh?
Celes:	   Something’s coming outta the wall!!

Celes:	   TunnelArmor!! I’ll draw it’s magic attack. It won’t hurt us.
Locke:	   Come again!?
Celes:	   I can simply absorb the attack with my Runic blade.
Locke:	   Are you sure you’ll be okay!?
Celes:	   Just you watch!!

Locke:	   Whew! Looks like we’re in the clear!

Terra:	   When Locke first helped me, he fiddled with something right about 
           here.
Edgar:	   Knowing him, there’s probably some secret switch in this rock 
           wall...

Edgar:	   Goodness...
Terra:	   What’s that...?
Edgar:	   I think this is a security checkpoint. If we follow the light 
           exactly, we’ll probably be okay. If we make a mistake, the light 
           will surround us. To proceed safely we must "tag" the glittering 
           light.

Arvis:     Banon! King Edgar! ... and Terra!!!
Banon:     Arvis! What's happpening here in Narshe?
Arvis:     The town's neutral. I've tried to get the people to side with the 
           Returners, but... Anyway, why on earth have you come here?
Edgar:     First, how are your people doing?
Arvis:     They all went slightly berserk when the Esper was discovered.
Banon:     We believe this young woman is our only hope of reaching out to 
           that Esper.
Arvis:     My people are dying to know what the Esper looks like. Maybe Terra
           can help restore some order to our town...?
Edgar:     That Esper is either going to save us... or dig us an early grave...

Sabin:     You... on a journey? I got separated from my brother. Say, can you 
           tell me how to get to Narshe?
Shadow:    Imperial soldiers have built a base somewhere beyond the forest.
Sabin:     ... Already!?
Shadow:    They seem to have their sights set on Doma Castle.
Sabin:     So Doma's next, huh? I have to reach Narshe immediately!
Shadow:    Your only hope is through Doma. I'll show you the way. Just know 
           that I may take off at any time, if I feel like it.
Shadow:    The Reaper is always just a step behind me...

Aged man:  Hey!!?
Aged man:  You the clock maker? I been waitin' for ages!
Uh... no. I'm not the clock maker.
Aged man:  There it is, on the wall. Ain't been tickin' for 1, 5, shucks,

This is an Imperial base. Too many soldiers...
Soldier A: Hey, have you heard?
Soldier B: Oh, you mean...
Soldier A: Shhh! Quiet down. If Kefka catches us, we're toast.
Soldier A: If he drives General Leo out of our battalion, he'll probably 
           become the next general!
Soldier B: Don't make me laugh! If someone like him becomes a general, I'll 
           go home!
Soldier A: Shhhhh! What if he hears you? You'll be jailed!
Soldier B: Alright, alright!
Soldier B: Uh-oh... Here he comes... Back to our posts!
Kefka:     Hey, you! You keeping a sharp lookout?
Soldier A: Yes, Sir. You're Kefka, correct? How are you, Sir?
Kefka:     Please! Save your petty small talk! Just do your job!
Soldier B: Phew...! Someone's gotta put that guy away!
Soldier B: I'd like to tell him to his face he's no General Leo!
Soldier A: Shhhh! Do I always have to tell you to keep it down!? You're 
           hopeless...!
Soldier A: I hate that weirdo, Kefka. I don't even think he's human, not like 
           General Leo...
Soldier B: Agreed.
Commander: You two! We're about to storm Doma Castle... You will join the 
           assault team!

Commander: Attack!
Doma sentry: It's hopeless. We can't keep them out.
Doma sentry: So, it's finally happening...
A moment, Sir!
Allow me the honor!

     "Faithful retainer to his family's liege, with the courage and strength 
     of a hundred men..."

Cyan:      If we can fell their commander, they'll surely give up.
Cyan:      Let us give it a try.
Doma sentry: Sir Cyan! Let their commander have it!

Cyan:      I am Cyan, retainer to the King of Doma. I am your worst 
           nightmare...
Trooper:   The general's been defeated! Run!!!
Cyan:      Walled up in there, we can wait out our enemy!

Soldier:   General Leo. The citizens of Doma seem to be playing a waiting 
           game...
Leo:       So, that's their strategy.
Soldier:   General. We're ready to take the castle. Just give the order...
Leo:       Patience! If we attack now, we'll have to sacrifice too many lives.
Soldier:   But, General! I'm ready to lay my life down at any time for the 
           Empire!
Leo:       You're from Maranda, right?
Soldier:   Y...yes Sir. Why?
Leo:       And your family lives there? Fall in battle, and I'll have to 
           deliver the bad news... What shall I say to them? You have a life 
           to go back to someday. Don't throw it all away for nothing. Emperor
           Gestahl wouldn't want that.
Soldier:   Yes, Sir!
Soldier:   General Leo!
Soldier:   A carrier pigeon from Emperor Gestahl.
Leo:       What...?
Leo:       The Emperor summons me. I must return immediately.
Soldier:   I understand, Sir.
Leo:       Right. I'll leave Doma in your hands.
Soldier:   Yes, Sir.
Leo:       Okay... Just don't jump the gun. Please...
Soldier:   Sir! Leave it to us, Sir!
Leo:       Right.
So that's General Leo... He could be my friend, if he weren't my enemy...

Kefka:     Now that Leo's gone, I'll turn this water into a flowing river of 
           poison!
Leo:       The Emperor has ordered me to return home. I don't want any trouble
           here!
Kefka:     You loser! I'll take care of this situation in no time!
Leo:       Don't be pompous! And DON'T forget that they are PEOPLE, just like 
           you and me.
Kefka:     We need not spare those lands that gave rise to the Returners!
Kefka:     You just go and pretend to be a good little boy...!
Kefka:     Is the poison ready?
Soldier:   But, General Leo said...
Kefka:     He's no longer here! I'm in charge now. Pour it!
Soldier:   Some of our people are prisoners inside the castle! If we poison 
           the river...
Kefka:     Do it! Take 'em all out!
That's inhuman!
Kefka:     Unh? Silence! You're history, bub...

Kefka:     Yeouch!!
Sabin:     Kefka! Wait!!!!
Kefka:     "Wait," he says... Do I look like a waiter?
Wait!!!

Wait!!!!

Kefka:     Ha, ha, ha! ...What a toad!
Kefka:     Yeouch!!
Sabin:     Kefka! Wait!!!!
Kefka:     "Wait," he says... Do I look like a waiter?
Kefka:     Huh!? How long do you expect me to put up with you? Next time, 
           you're a goner.

Kefka:     Oh, gripe! Hey! If you know what's good for you...

Kefka:     Hee, hee! Nothing can beat the music of hundreds of voices 
           screaming in unison! Uwa, ha, ha!
Doma sentry: Sir Cyan! The Empire's base is bustling with activity. Something 
           must be up!
Cyan:      Huh? The water looks odd...
Doma sentry: Sir Cyan!
Cyan:      This is... POISON!
Doma sentry: What lowdown, contemptible...!
Cyan:      Guard our liege!

Doma sentry: To the King, on the double!
Cyan:      Right! The King's room is near!

Cyan:      Your Highness! Fear not!
King Doma: Who's there?
Cyan:      Cyan, excellency.
King Doma: Indeed! My sight is going fast... can't see a thing...
Cyan:      Excellency! Hang on!
King Doma: Cyan... You have defended the realm since my father's days... hack,
           cough... Thank you... It's over... Our kingdom is through.
Cyan:      Not yet, Highness!
King Doma: I fear for your family. Unh... chest is on f... fire...
Cyan:      Save your strength! Don't talk!
King Doma: Go... run to your family... hack... gasp... ......
Cyan:      Highness!!
Doma sentry: Sir Cyan!
Cyan:      There have to be some survivors in the castle!
Doma sentry: Let's split up...

Cyan:      Elayne! Elayne, wake up!
Cyan:      This... this... can't be happening!
Cyan:      ! Owain! NOT YOU TOO! Son... you can't BOTH leave me!
Cyan:      D... Dear me...
Cyan:      I... Impossible! Idiotic!!! We can't forgive this! The Empire must 
           pay!

Warrior:   I am Cyan, retainer to King Doma!
Soldier:   The enemy! Get ready, everyone!
Sabin:     !
Sabin:     May I give you a hand!?
Cyan:      Thank you... whoever you are.

Sabin:     Let me have at it!
Cyan:      What a mess!! Be careful, Sir!!

Look... we're gonna have to do this together!
Cyan:      The thought had occurred to me as well!

Cyan:      Thank you, kind sir!
Sabin:     Allow me to thank you! I am Sabin, from Figaro. Now, let's scram!
Cyan:      But what of my home, my family... my friends?
Sabin:     Look... If we stick around any longer we'll have a regiment of 
           troops down our throats.
Soldier:   Got 'em! Over here!
Sabin:     Hoo, boy...
Sabin:     I have a great idea... come over here.

Cyan:      Sir Sabin! What on earth are these?
Sabin:     I'll explain later! Relax. Just climb in!
Cyan:      Sir Sabin! How might these abominations be manipulated?
Sabin:     I'm getting sick of this! Thou art such a pain in the...! Confound 
           it all! I'm starting to talk like you!
Sabin:     Now listen. Just use those levers located by your hands.
Cyan:      Sir Sabin! It is I who is in your debt!
Sabin:     Forget it. Now, come on!
Soldier:   Hey! What are you doing?
Cyan:      Aahh! We can't stop now!
Sabin:     Then let's just bust through!

End of the line!

There's nowhere to run!

Who said anything about running!?

Sabin:     Can't believe we've made it this far... Say, how do we get to 
           Narshe from here?
Cyan:      Narshe, eh? Only one route, through the forest to the south.
Sabin:     All right! It's decided. Let's get going!

Sabin:     Hey! We can get in right here!

N.o... e.s.c.a.p.e...!
Hey...
Uh, oh...?
Bloody persistent...!
We have to detach the rear train cars!

Can't follow us now.

Sabin:     Food! Food! Bring me everything ya got!
Cyan:      A... are you going to be okay if you eat THIS?
Sabin:     Worried? Can't wage war on an empty stomach!
CYan:      Hummm... Sir! I won't hear any more of this kind of talk!
Gobble... snarf... snap...
Sabin:     Well! I've stuffed down all I can... Let's go!

This is the engineer's room. Gotta stop this thing...!

Something's written here!
What? What?
To stop the train, shut the first and third pressure valves, and operate the 
switch outside, near the smoke stack.

Phantom Train: So! You've been slowing my progress!
Phantom Train: I will let you go... but first there is something I must do...

Cyan: Gulp... where are we?

Sabin:     Hoo, boy! FInally got off...
Sabin:     We shouldn't be here. Let's go NOW!
Cyan:      No!!! Elayne! Owain!!
Sabin:     Cyan! Is that your wife and child? Departing!?

Sabin:     What manner of rubbish do you suppose he's gonna...?
Gau:       Gau's treasure... shiny, shiny!! Shiny, shiny, shiny!!!
Sabin:     Can anything be THAT shiny?
Gau:       Does Mr. Thou like shiny thing?
Sabin:     Mr. Thou's that one, over THERE!! A shiny thing, eh...? Think how 
           jealous Locke's gonna be when he hears about this!
Gau:       Who be Locke? He bad man? Maybe he try steal my treasure!
Sabin:     Locke? Well, he's...
Sabin:     Listen when someone's talking to you!
Cyan:      I think he's trying to tell us something!
Sabin:     Urgh... alright... carry on...
Gau:       Here! Here! Shiny thing here!!
Gau:       Sabin, place where you buy food... it called Mobliz!
Gau:       Cyan, place where you stand... river brought you there... Now, we 
           go Crescent Mountain! Shiny thing, there!
Cyan:      Look, let's just go along with him to this Crescent Mountain.
Sabin:     Phew... why'd we invite him along, anyway...?
Gau:       Mr. Thou! Hurry up! We're leaving!!
Sabin:     Hey! I told you once, I'm not Mr. Thou!!!

Sabin:     Cyan! The shiny thing Gau spoke of is in here.
Cyan:      Uh, Sir Gau, where exactly is it?
Gau:       Gau... forget!!
Sabin:     Shall we look around?
Cyan:      Indeed!

Cyan:      Is this it? Gau's "treasure"?
Gau:       Treasure... yesss...
Cyan:      Looks like glass...
Sabin:     Looks like it just might fit...
Sabin:     Hmmm... Is this of any use?
Sabin:     Will this really let us breathe underwater?
Sabin:     Let's go!

Cyan:      Current's... fast.
Sabin:     No kidding.
Sabin:     But unless we hop in, we won't see our friends again...
Sabin:     Let's go!

Cyan:      Narshe is just a stone's throw away!
Sabin:     I hope the others arrived safely!
Cyan:      I'm sure they did.
Gau:       Me hope so, too...

The three have reached Narshe, and a decisive battle is about to take place...

11. NARSHE

Elder:     I understand all of it... Except... How can WE be encouraging 
           bloodshed?
Arvis:     I never said that!
Elder:     Something like it.
Banon:     Ha! He's right you know!
Arvis:     Banon!
Banon:     Our blood will spill because of you.
Banon:     Emperor Gestahl's racing to acquire Magitek power. He's set his 
           sights on the Esper that was found here! The increased use of 
           Magitek power will surely lead to global destruction...
Elder:     The War of the Magi... The mythical battle that set mankind back a 
           thousand years... Can this really be happening?
Elder:     People will never learn...
Sabin:     Brother!
Edgar:     Sabin! You're all right!
Edgar:     Who's with you?
Cyan:      I'm Cyan, retainer to the lord of Doma!
Gau:       Gau... Gau!
Sabin:     The people of Doma were wiped out by the Empire...
Cyan:      Kefka poisoned... everyone...
Elder:     Barbaric!
Banon:     Elder!
Elder:     But... that was only because Doma was collaborating with the 
           Returners! If we make that mistake...
Locke:     That's nonsense!!
Terra:     Locke!
Locke:     The Empire's poised to attack Narshe right now!
Edgar:     What!?
Banon:     Locke. Where'd you hear that?
Locke:     Celes, here, was one of the Empire's generals...
Cyan:      Grrr! I knew she seemed familiar. Sir Gau, out of my way!
Cyan:      This is General Celes! She torched Maranda! She's an Imperial Spy! 
           Now, stand aside!
Locke:     Wait! Celes has joined the Returners! She's fighting with us, now!
Cyan:      But...!
Locke:     I promised I'd protect her. I WILL NOT back down on my word.
Edgar:     Locke... are you still thinking about... that?
Terra:     I was also an Imperial soldier.
Cyan:      WHAT!!
Edgar:     The Empire's evil. But not ALL of it's citizens are!
Sabin:     Oh, this is...
Emergency!! The Empire cometh!!

Kefka:     I don't care what you do here, JUST GET ME THAT ESPER!!
Soldier:   Lord Kefka! There're civilians here...!
Kefka:     Exterminate everyone!
Soldier:   But Narshe is neutral...
Kefka:     Idiot!!
Kefka:     Read my lips!! Dispose of any who oppose us! March!

Elder:     We really have no choice. Let's make ready for war!
Banon:     They're after the Esper.
Elder:     We moved it into the hills.
Edgar:     Then we're going up after it!

Celes:     So you were born with the power of Magic!? Isn't it a lovely 
           gift...
Terra:     You... can use Magic, too?
Celes:     When I was a baby I was artificially infused with Magic, and raised
           as a Magitek Knight.
Terra:     Have you... loved anyone?
Celes:     ??? What's that supposed to mean?

Cyan:      Don't think for a moment I trust you!
Celes:     Fine. Use your own eyes, then decide.

Banon:     They're coming!
Kefka:     Oho!! It's General Celes, the traitor! How delightful! This'll be 
           fun!
Kefka:     Go!! Get those vile insects!

Kefka:     Don't think you won. I'll be back!
Kefka:     Aack!! I won't forget this!
Edgar:     Where's the Esper?
Locke:     Is it okay?

Edgar:     That was a close call!
Cyan:      Can it still be alive?
Sabin:     Impossible... right!?
Locke:     Terra!! What is it!?
Terra:     Nooo!!
Sabin:     Terra 'n the Esper...
Edgar:     There's... some kinda reaction!

Terra:     What!? What am I feeling!?
Terra:     Huh? W...what's going on...?
Terra:     Please... tell me! Who am I? WHO!?
Locke:     Terra!
Celes:     An Esper... I can actually feel it's mind...
Edgar:     Terra... Step away from the Esper...

Locke:     Unhh...
Celes:     You're awake?
Locke:     ... Where's Terra!?
Celes:     She changed into a... something, and... took off. She looked 
           like...
Celes:     She looked like... an Esper...
Edgar:     Locke! You okay?
Edgar:     Something happened to Terra... There seems to be some connection 
           between Espers and her... Anyway, we need to find her. Witnesses 
           saw her screaming across the sky to the west.
Locke:     Let's go! I promised her I'd...
Celes:     Locke...
Edgar:     Think, people! The Empire still wants that Esper.
Sabin:     Banon needs our help, too...
Cyan:      A formal Imperial soldier... But we've no choice. We must help her!
Edgar:     Let's split up. Those who aren't searching for Terra will stay and 
           guard Narshe. Figaro Castle can shuttle us to the western province.
           Then we'll make for Kohlingen or Jidoor.

Sabin:     This is like old times! I have to wander around for a while!

Sabin:     Hmmm... Castle hasn't changed much...
Sabin:     And yet it's all different... Mom and Dad are gone... Everyone's 
           gone... Since that day...

... tonight...
... took a turn for the worse...
... theres a chance he'll...
... Sabin...
... SABIN!!
... my father...
... I dont believe this...
Sabin:     B-brother... Waa, ahhh, ahhh...
Edgar:     So... They went and told you...
Matron:    Edgar! Here you are...
Matron:    Your father... He just uttered his last wish that Figaro be divided
           between you...
Sabin:     This is NONSENSE!! Everyone's saying that the Empire poisoned 
           Dad... And the only thing on your mind is "Who's going to be the 
           next King!?" You're all pathetic!
Sabin:     No-one cared when Mom passed away, either...
Matron:    That's not...
Sabin:     You were as bad as any of 'em!
Edgar:     Sabin...
Sabin:     Empire of murderers... They won't get away with this!
Edgar:     Matron... Please leave us...
Sabin:     I'm outta here! I'm forsaking this war-sick realm for my dignity 
           and freedom.
Sabin:     You said you were sick of it too, right!?
Edgar:     ... freedom...
Edgar:     What'll happen to this realm if we both leave? And what would Dad  
           say...?
Edgar:     Sabin, let's settle this with the toss of a coin.
Edgar:     If it's heads, you win. We'll choose whichever path we want, with
           out any regrets. Okay?
Edgar:     This is for Dad!

Edgar:     And then, you opted for your freedom.
Edgar:     It's been... 10 years. The little shrimp's grown into a whopping 
           lobster!
Sabin:     And you're a king crab!
Edgar:     Sabin... I often wonder if he'd be proud of me...
Sabin:     Don't you ever doubt that!
Edgar:     10 years...
Sabin:     Where has the time gone...?
Edgar:     Here's to a couple of confused grownups!
Edgar:     Here's to Dad...
Sabin:     ... to Mom... and to Figaro.

Lots of requests this month! If it's your wish, I'll take you beyond the 
mountains.
Urgggh!
Next stop, Kohlingen! Watch your step!

Girl? Haven't seen any girls here. Might wanna check the top of this building.

Good day, gentle folks. Can I be of service? I hate fighting, so I'd better 
let you pass!

Oooooh... gurururu...
Terra?
Terra?
Ramuh:     She's scared, you know.
Who're you?
Ramuh:     This girl is your friend?
Is Terra all right?
Ramuh:     You call her Terra... ...Terra? How odd...
Ramuh:     She is undamaged. But I fear she can't understand you. As for me, I
           am Ramuh. The Esper, Ramuh.
ESPER!?
"But don't Espers live in another world?"
Ramuh:     That doesn't mean we don't live here, too. Espers take a variety of
           forms. Sometimes we live here, taking the shape of humans. You have
           nothing to fear from us.
"Why do you hide the fact that you're Espers?"
Ramuh:     Humans and Espers can't survive together.
"But grandmother once told me that Espers and people once lived side by side. 
Was that just a fairy tale?"
Ramuh:     No, that was no fairy tale. That was true. We started out as 
           friends. Then along came the War of the Magi...
War of the Magi...
Ramuh:     It took place... long ago. Espers fought humans who were infused 
           with magical powers extracted from Espers... Fearing our magical  
           powers would once again become a target, we fashioned a new realm, 
           and moved there. Humans were seeking to become invincible, and they
           invaded our realm. In response to this, we erected a doorway and 
           kicked the humans out. 
Ramuh:     Even as we speak, many of my kind aew trapped in the Empire's 
           Magitek Research Facility, being... ...drained of their powers... I
           fled here to avoid a similar fate.
Ramuh:     That's right, relax.
Ramuh:     I sensed that Terra was in trouble. My Magic... summoned her here.
"Terra's... an Esper?"
Ramuh:     No, she's actually quite different.
"Terra looks like she's in pain."
Ramuh:     Her very existence strikes fear into her own heart.
"How can we help her?"
Ramuh:     When she accepts this aspect of herself, I think she'll be all 
           right.
"We have to do something!"
Ramuh:     Then free those of my kind imprisoned in Gestahl's Magitek Research
           Facility. One of them can surely help her.
"If we find the Magitek Research Facility, you're sure we'll find your 
people?"
Ramuh:     Like a coward, I escaped leaving the others there. It'll be the end
           of them...
"What do you mean?"
Ramuh:     Gestahl's method is incorrect. You can't drain a live Esper of all 
           it's power. It is only when we are reduced to Magicite that our 
           abilities can be transferred in total...
"Pardon!?"
Ramuh:     When we transform into Magicite, our power can be relocated.
"Magicite...!?"
Ramuh:     That's what's left of us when we... pass away.
Ramuh:     These are my comrades who fell while escaping the Empire. And I 
           will give you my power, as well...
"Old man..." Are you really gone...?
Magicite...?
He traded his power, so that others might live...

"Why are you doing this...?"
Ramuh:     We few can help save many. The War of the Magi must not be 
           repeated...

Terra... wait for us. We'll be back!

Everyone here? I was thinking, ...
Edgar:     Let's talk on the way!

Edgar:     The Empire's trying to drain Magic from Espers...
Sabin:     This can't be true... Celes...?
Celes:     I don't remember because I was asleep when they... augmented me. 
           But I've heard rumours to that effect.
Cyan:      Then we're going in...
Edgar:     We'll split into two groups. We still need to beef up our defenses 
           in Narshe.
Cyan:      Indeed.
Celes:     I'll go to the Empire, I know it well...
Sabin:     But alone...?
Locke:     Don't worry, I'll go with her.
Celes:     Locke!
Cyan:      You need a hand?

Locke:     Please wait for us in Narshe. We'll find our way back safely.
"If you wish to change group members, head for Narshe."
Celes:     So... how we gonna get there? The Empire's on the continent to the 
           South. No boats go there...
Locke:     The people of Jidoor, a town to the south, can probably help us.
Celes:     Locke.
Locke:     Yes?
Celes:     Why are you coming with me?
Locke:     Well... There're bound to be treasures there. And besides, I've 
           always wanted an inside look at the Empire!

Impresario: Maria!?
Celes:     Are you talking to me?
Impresario: Sorry... my mistake. Wow, you could pass for Maria in a heartbeat!
           Hoo boy, now I really am in trouble...
Celes looks just like Maria...?

That PERSON dropped it off.
Master:    He's the director of the operas here. Everyone just calls him 
           "Impresario". He's been in a tizzy ever since that letter arrived.

"My Dear Maria,
 I want you for my wife. I'm coming for you...
          The Wandering Gambler"

Locke:     Who's this "Wandering...?" whats-his-name?
Master:    You born on a farm, son?

     "A blackjack-playing, world-travelling, casino-dwelling free spirit..."

That's Setzer, owner of the world's only airship.
Celes:     If we could get that airship, we'd make the Empire in no time.
Locke:     Let's set up a meeting... with Setzer...



=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
16. OPERA HOUSE
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Impresario: Ah! You again!
Locke:     I read that letter. Setzer's coming to steal her...
Impresario: He'll probably appear right at the climax of Scene 1. He loves an 
           entrance...
Locke:     Right! If we could only grab him then...!
Impresario: Dear me, NO! You'll ruin the performance! I'll lose my job!
Celes:     Then you're history!
Impresario: This is simply horrid! I want the performance to be a success! But
           I don't want Maria to be abducted...!
Locke:     We'll let him grab her...
Locke:     We'll use Celes as a decoy. After she's abducted, I'll follow 'em 
           right to his airship!
Impresario: Are you mad!? If something should happen to Maria...
Locke:     That's why the decoy! We'll hide Maria somewhere safe!
Impresario: Come again?
Locke:     You said SHE looks like Maria, right?
Celes:     Now just a minute...
Locke:     Celes will be our Maria! She'll lead us to the airship!
Impresario: Brilliant!
Celes:     W...wait! I'm a GENERAL, not some opera floozy!

Mii... Mii... Do, re, mi... Faa... hack, cough...
Maa... rii aaaa...

Locke:     Not bad, Celes!
Ultros:    Mwa, ha, ha! I'll pretend to be Setzer and foil their little plan!
Locke:     Let's get ready! Celes, it's show time!
Ultros:    D'haaaaa! Come on! Read it...!

The West and East were waging war...
Draco, the West's great hero, thinks of his love, Maria.
Is she safe? Is she waiting?

"Oh Maria
 Oh Maria
 Please hear my voice!
 How I long to be with you!"

Locke:     I'm going to the dressing room.
Impresario: Is everything okay?

Locke:     Aye yai yai! Izzat... you!?
Celes:     Locke. Why did you help me escape back there?
Locke:     I... once abandoned someone when she needed me...
Locke:     That ribbon suits you.
Celes:     On with the show! This is the big scene in which Maria senses that 
           something's happened to Draco!
Locke:     You'd better check the score one more time.

The forces of the West fell, and Maria's castle was taken.
Prince Ralse, of the East, took her hand by force. But she never stopped 
yearning for Draco...

"Oh my hero, so far away now.
 Will I ever see your smile?
 Love goes away, like night into day.
 It's just a fading dream...
 I'm the darkness, you're the stars.
 Our love is brighter than the sun.
 For eternity, for me can there be, only you, my chosen one...
 Must I forget you?
 Our solemn promise?
 Will autumn take the place of spring?
 What shall I do?
 I'm lost without you.
 Speak to me once more!"

Draco:     Come, Maria! Follow my lead...

Draco:     Ha, ha, ha...

"We must part now. My life goes on.
 But my heart won't give you up.
 Ere I walk away, let me hear you say.
 I meant as much to you...
 So gently, you touched my heart.
 I will be forever yours.
 Come what may, I won't age a day.
 I'll wait for you, always..."

Chancellor: Prince Ralse is looking for a dance partner. Leave the past 
           behind! Our kingdom is adopting the spirit of the East!

Locke:     Well done, Celes.

"I owe you one, so I'm gonna jam up your opera!
          Ultros"
Locke:     Uh oh... Better tell the Impresario!

Impresario: What!?

"The survivors of the West attack!"
Ralse:     Impossible!
Attack!
"Maria..."
"Draco, I've waited so long. I knew you'd come."
"Maria, will finally have to become my queen!"
"For the rest of my life I'll keep you near..."

Impresario: But how might he disrupt the opera?
... With that!?
Ultros:    Mwa ha ha! Let's see if Maria can shrug THIS off!
Ultros:    N'ghaaa! This is heavier than I thought! It'll take me five minutes
           to drop it!
Locke:     We haven't a second to lose!
Impresario: Talk to the man in the room to the far right! He'll help you get 
           up there!
Locke:     It's as good as done!

Stage Master: The Impresario asked me to have you press the far right switch.

Ultros:    Phew! Rats!

Impresario: Disaster! If the two heroes are flattened, the opera's over! Then 
           who'll win the girl?
Locke:     Neither Draco nor Ralse will save Celes!
Locke:     I, Locke, the world's premier adventurer, will save her!
Impresario: Oh boy... What awful acting!
Ultros:    Silence! You are in the presence of octopus royalty! A lowborn thug
           like you could never defeat me!
Impresario: Hmmm... Might as well make the most of this. MUSIC!

Long time no see! You've changed! Did ya miss me?
Here! Over here!
Imp! Pal! Old Buddy!
I'm not your garden-variety octopus!
Havin' fun?
Have ya read it?
How sweet it is!
What an unlucky day! Adios!

Just a darn minute!
What a performance!!
Impresario: Setzer!!
Setzer:    I'm a man of my word, music man!
Celes:     Thats HIM...!?
Impresario: What a reversal! Thinking she's Locke's new queen, Maria is 
           instead nabbed by Setzer! What fate lies in store for her? Stay 
           tuned for Part 2!

Setzer:    I'll deal with you in a minute!
Locke:     What a performance!
Celes:     Enough already!
Locke:     But this is a tough one! Part 2 begins now!
Locke:     ... Where's Setzer?
Celes:     He's coming.
Setzer:    W...Who're YOU? You're not Maria!
Celes:     Setzer, we need your help. We have to go to Vector. We need this 
           ship to get there.
Setzer:    Look, if you're not Maria, I don't want you aboard.
Celes:     Wait! We were told your ship is the finest vessel in the world.
Locke:     And that you were the world's most notorious gambler...
Edgar:     I'm the King of Figaro. If you co-operate, you'll be well 
           rewarded...
Setzer:    Come here.
Celes:     Yeah...
Setzer:    Don't misunderstand me.  I'm still not sure if I'm going to help 
           you.

Setzer:    Phew. The Empire's made me a rich man.
Celes:     Stop thinking of yourself. Many towns and villages have been 
           smashed by the Empire.
Locke:     The Empire's also totally rotten. It's using Magic to enslave the 
           world.
Edgar:     The Empire and my realm were allies... until recently.
Sabin:     The Empire'll end up owning you!
Setzer:    The Empire ...evil... ?
Celes:     We all hate the Empire for the same reasons. That's why...
Setzer:    You know... you're even more stunning than Maria.
Celes:     ????
Setzer:    Enough! If you... If Celes becomes my wife, I'll help. Otherwise...
Locke:     WHAT! Are you stupid!?
Celes:     We haven't any choice.
Setzer:    Yes! It's settled!
Celes:     But I have conditions... We'll decide with a coin toss. If it's 
           heads, you'll help us. If it's tails, I'll go with you. Well, Mr. 
           Gambler...?
Setzer:    Oh ho! Fine! I accept!
Locke:     Listen to yourself! Celes... you can't become his wife! You just 
           can't!
Celes:     Ready?
Celes:     I win! Now, honour your part of the bargain!
Setzer:    How... unusual! A coin with identical sides...!
Sabin:     That coin...?! BIG BROTHER!!! Don't tell me...!
Celes:     I think you've been hustled, Mr. Gambler.
Setzer:    Ha! How low can you get!? I love it! All right, I'll help you. 
           Nothing to lose but my life... My life is a chip in your pile! Ante
           up!

Locke:     This unwieldly-looking ship really moves! Could it crash?
Setzer:    When things fall, they fall! It's all a matter of fate...
Locke:     This ship's going to stick out like a sore thumb. Better land some 
           distance away.
Setzer:    Right. I'll wait on board in case of an emergency.

17. VECTOR

Pledge your allegiance to the Empire?
What!!
Right... I'm sure you can do it!
Young people... Hang in there!

Shh! I'm a Returner sympathizer! I've heard of you!
While I distract the soldiers, climb onto the steel tower from this box, and 
enter the facility!
All ready?
Man:       I.. I'm gonna be sick!
Soldier:   Get outta here!
Man:       Urgh... Gonna toss it all...
Soldier:   Hey...

18. MAGITEK FACILITY
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Kefka:     I'm all powerful! Hee, hee, haw! I'm collecting Espers! I'm 
           extracting Magic! And... ... ... I'll restore the... Statues!
Kefka:     You've been completely drained of your powers! Now you're useless 
           to me!
Kefka:     And you! Take a hike!

I sensed a kindred spirit...
Who're you...?
You have Ramuh's power...?
Wait!
We're... Espers...

Ifrit:     Hmmm...
Shiva:     Well, Ramuh DID entrust them with his power.

Ifrit:     Gestahl has grabbed our friends and is trying to drain them of 
           their power.
Ifrit:     I, too, suffered my turn in one of the glass tubes...

Shiva:     They drained our powers, then threw us away too... We haven't long 
           to live... We will follow Ramuh's lead, and give to you our 
           power...

Our friends are all gone... We haven't much time left... We have no choice but
to entrust you with our essences...

Esper:     You want to help me... But... I haven't long to live. Just as Ifrit
           did before me, I'll give to you my power...
Cid:       What are you doing there?
Cid:       W... What's this!?
Cid:       So... Esper magical power can only truly be transferred when one of
           them passes away...
Recieved Magicite!
Celes:     Professor Cid.
Cid:       General Celes! And who might these dubious characters be? Your 
           troops?
Celes:     No... You see, ...
Cid:       Can it be true that you came here as a spy, seeking to cause an 
           uprising!?
Locke:     !? Celes...?
Kefka:     So that's it! Magicite... Cid, you miserable blockhead! Now...
Kefka:     General Celes!! The game's over. Bring me those Magicite shards!
Locke:     Celes! You... decieved me!?
Celes:     Of course not! Have a little faith!
Kefka:     G'hee, hee, hee! She has tricked you all! Celes, that's so... YOU!
Celes:     Locke... Please believe me...
Locke:     I... ... ...
Kefka:     NOW!!
Kefka:     Exterminate all of them!
Celes:     Locke... Let me protect you for once... Maybe now... Now you'll 
           believe me...
Kefka:     Celes! W... What are you doing? Stop it!!!

Locke:     Celes...
Cid:       Ooh, ooh... What happened?
Cid:       This is a disaster! Your fighting has caused the capsules to 
           rupture! Their contents are spilling out!
Cid:       Quick! Over here!

Cid:       Kefka has used me... used the Empire. WHat have I done...?
Cid:       The life-energy of those Espers...
Cid:       You've helped me come to a decision. I'm going to talk to the 
           Emperor and have this stupid war stopped!

Cid:       Celes... I've known her since she was a baby. I raised her as if 
           she were my own daughter! But she was forced to become a Magitek 
           Knight, and has done some awful things. If I could only talk to 
           her... I'd apologize for the way her life has turned out.
Cid:       No! It's Kefka!
Cid:       GO!!

Setzer:    I was starting to worry...
Setzer:    ? What's up with Celes?
Locke:     ......
Setzer:    We'll talk later. Let's get outta here!

Kefka:     Crud! What a mess!!
Kefka:     I dont think so...! You won't get away!

Locke:     Let's not overstay our visit. We're outta here on the double!
Setzer:    Right. Speaking of which, maybe we should be leaving...
Edgar:     Something horrible's coming!!
Sabin:     Uwaaoo! What in the ...?

Locke:     I'm worried about Terra. Let's return to Zozo.
Setzer:    Terra? Who's that?
Locke:     I'll explain on the way... about Terra... Espers... the 
           Returners...

We're all here...
Locke:     Terra...
Locke:     Magicite!!
Terra:     Father...?
Terra:     I remember it all... I was raised in the Esper's world.

19. ESPER WORLD
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The Esper World...

Maduin:    Listen well, and think clearly!

She's pretty weak. Better let her rest for a moment.

Maduin:    Did I awaken you?
Girl:      You're... an Esper? What's that pendant for?
Maduin:    It's... yours now! It helps protect the Esper World.
Girl:      Esper World... Boy, did I take the low road or what?
Maduin:    The Esper folk are pretty upset, you being a human and all...
Girl:      You're the one who saved me?
Maduin:    I am Maduin. I tired of living in the human world... That world is 
           filled with desire, greed and loathing. It's highly infectious...
Maduin:    Are humans and Espers truly... so different?
Madonna:   So... I'm an example of the evil in this world, huh?
Maduin:    No, I mean...
Madonna:   I'll return to my world tomorrow!
Maduin:    You'll need a guide.

Youth:     What's wrong, Maduin?

Maduin:    If you don't want to return to your world, you may stay here.
Madonna:   But humans and Espers can never co-exist...!
Maduin:    How do we know for sure unless we try for ourselves?
How do we know...
unless we...
observe for ourselves...?
Maduin:    We've given her a name...
Madonna:   What?
Maduin:    It's Terra. Not bad, huh?

2 years later...

Humans!!!!! The nexus between our worlds has opened again!! The wind... so 
odd... just like two years ago...
But something's different now... Troops have come seeking our magical power.
Blast it! Thay've made it as far as the Elder's house!
Gestahl:   Aha! We've finally found it! Those ancient writings told us of this 
           world, and described the awesome magical properties of these 
           beasts!
Gestahl:   Grab them! Riches to any man who captures an Esper! GO!

Elder:     We've no choice... We must do what we've been avoiding...
Maduin:    You mean... the Magic barrier?
Elder:     Here's the plan. We'll cause a tempest that'll sweep all the nasty 
           creatures out of our realm. Then we'll seal the gate... I am the 
           last of our kind able to cast this magical seal.
Maduin:    But in your state, you might just...
Elder:     Pass away... but at least we will finally be safe.
Maduin:    Madonna......
Madonna:   I, for one, will not miss the other side...
Elder:     Let's do it. We have no other choice.

Esper:     This is all because of that human girl!
Maduin:    Nonsense!
Esper:     I'm sure she helped the others find us!
Maduin:    Get a grip on yourself!
Esper:     No! She's one of them! Soon she'll be wearing our hides!
Maduin:    Urghhh!

Elder:     Where are you going!?
Maduin:    Madonna's getting drawn into the next world...!
Elder:     Impossible! It's too late! I've already begun casting the barrier. 
           There's no turning back!
Maduin:    That fool...

Soldier:   Look what popped out!
Gestahl:   Shriek!!! Just when we were in reach of a veritable bonanza...!

Madonna:   Maduin... I'm not their friend...
Maduin:    I understand that!
Madonna:   Thank you...
Maduin:    Can you make it back here?
Madonna:   Sure...
TERRA!!!
Maduin:    Madonna!!

Gestahl:   A... human girl? Wh... Who is she?
Madonna:   Please... take care... of my baby...
Gestahl:   YOUR girl!? Eh!? Hmmm... then she's half human and half... How 
           absolutely fascinating!
Gestahl:   Mwa, ha, ha... She will help us realize our dream faster than we 
           ever imagined!
Madonna:   N... noooo!!!
Gestahl:   Quiet, my dear!!
Gestahl:   We will own this world! Ha, ha, ha...

Terra:     That was my father...?
Terra:     I'm the product of an Esper and a human... That's where I got my 
           powers... Now I understand... I finally feel I can begin to control 
           this power of mine...
Edgar:     So Gestahl must have known the secret of the Espers' power back 
           then.
Locke:     And the Espers at the facility were grabbed during that expedition! 
           That means Celes' power came...... at the expense of an Esper...
Sabin:     They can't get away with this! We have to strike back!
Terra:     What's happening in Narshe?
Locke:     Hmm... Maybe we should head back that way.
Setzer:    The airship's ready!
Terra:     Come on!

Setzer:    By all means! Take a turn at the wheel!



=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
20. NARSHE
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

We've been waiting for you. This way, please...

Banon:     Oh, you're here! The people of Narshe have finally decided to 
           battle the Empire. How did it go at Vector...?
Arvis:     I see... Your plan would combine Narshe's money with Figaro's 
           machinery to storm the Empire... not enough manpower, though...
Banon:     We have to open the sealed gate...
Terra!?
Terra:     To the Esper World...?
Arvis:     We'll never beat the Empire without them.
Banon:     When the gate has been opened, the Espers can attack from the east. 
           We'll storm in at the same time, from the north. No way around it.
Banon:     We MUST get the Espers to understand. We have to establish a bond 
           of trust between humand and Espers. Only one person can do this...
Terra...
Half human, half Esper... My existence is proof that such a bond CAN exist...
Terra:     I'll do it. I'm the only one who can!

Banon:     Get the Espers to understand, and we can bring this war to a 
           screeching halt. Terra... I know you can do this...

Arvis:     The sealed gate stands at the eastern edge of the Empire. There's a 
           base there, but somehow we'll have to slip through...

Elder:     Our battle lies before us. We must make ourselves ready.



=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
21. CAVE TO THE SEALED GATE
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

That's odd...
No Imperial soldiers...
Terra:     Let's get this over with.

This is the sealed gate...
Cyan:      What an eerie place...
Edgar:     From here, it's all up to Terra...
Sabin:     We're counting on you, Terra...
Terra:     ......
Terra!     ...the gate... quickly!

K... Kefka!! You followed us!
Kefka:     U'hee, hee, hee!!!!! The Emperor was right! Let Terra fall into 
           your hands, and you'd open the gate for us...!
...!
Kefka:     How does it feel to know you've been working for us!?
Kefka:     Now I fear you've outlived your usefulness...
You'd better think again, Kefka!
Kefka:     Oh dear... you wanna fight me!? This is just dreadful!
Keep Kefka busy until Terra slips through the gate!!
Look! The, the door's opening!

Terra:     Espers... Please heed my call...

Kefka:     It opened!!
Terra!!!
Kefka:     I, I, I, I feel so anxious.
Something's coming!!!
Kefka:     Frightful energy!!
Kefka:     Uwaaa!
Terra!!!
Terra:     ...

Hey! The gate!!!
What about those Espers...?
Terra:     Look, let's return to the airship.

What happened?
The Espers flew off together... Then, the Empire's citizens ran off as though 
they were terrified.
Which way did the Espers go?
Towards the capital... Vector...

Setzer:    We're almost at Vector.
There! What's that?
Locke:     What's wrong, Terra?
Terra:     I can feel it... It's coming closer and closer...
Locke:     What do you mean you can feel it?
Terra:     It was... glowing!
Locke:     What's that?
Locke:     It can't be...! An Esper???
Locke:     It's coming!!! Watch out, Terra!!
Setzer:    What was that!?
Locke:     Setzer, get down!
Setzer:    Gulp... Espers...?
Locke:     Where are they going?
Terra:     They were mad...
Locke:     They seemed... angry.
Terra:     No... Stop...! Please, don't go!!
Forget that, what's with this vibration!? Is it from the Espers?
Edgar:     Um... SETZER!!!! I've lost control!!!!



=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
22. VECTOR AND THE IMPERIAL PALACE
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The Emperor's expecting you. This way...

Gestahl:   I've lost my will to fight...
Cid:       The Emperor's had a change of heart...
Cid!!
Cid:       The Espers came to save their friends. When they learned the others 
           had perished, they went berserk, and trashed the town... Never will 
           I forget their shrieks of rage...
Trooper:   We're hanging up our weapons and armour for good.
Gestahl:   The power of those Espers... I had no idea... They'll shred the 
           world! We must get them to understand we are no longer at war.
Cid:       No human's going to make them sit down and listen...
Gestahl:   But for now my friends... Let us feast and rejoice!
Cid:       There are some people here who'd prefer to keep fighting. Please, 
           before we dine, talk to as many soldiers as you can! Make them 
           understand!
Trooper:   Please talk to as many soldiers as you can. You have 4 minutes 
           until dinner.

That evening, the banquet with the Emperor took place...

Trooper:   This way, please.
Cid:       You can count me in as a Returner!
Gestahl:   Imagine! All of us here together, sharing a meal! First we must 
           have a toast!
Gestahl:   Well then... To our hometowns!
Gestahl:   As you know, Kefka's in jail for war crimes. What shall we do with 
           him?
Gestahl:   Hmm... Well, let's let him stew in his cell for a while. Then we'll 
           decide what to do.
Gestahl:   I truly apologize about the poisoning of Doma. No-one dreamed Kefka 
           would use poison.
Gestahl:   I'm so terribly sorry! Kefka's being severely punished, and we're 
           cleaning up the poison.
Gestahl:   By the way... with regard to General Celes...
Gestahl:   Kefka was lying. General Celes realized the war was stupid before 
           anyone else. That's why she joined the Returners. Any other 
           questions for me?
Why'd you start the war?
Gestahl:   My desire for power got the best of me. Now I've come to my senses.
Why do you want peace now?
Gestahl:   I feel we need each other's help at this time...
Why'd we have to talk to your men?
Gestahl:   Some of my men refuse to embrace peace. I felt they'd understand if 
           they actually met you face to face.
Gestahl:   With your permission, I'd like to talk about the Espers...
Gestahl:   My Empire's been decimated by the Espers that emerged from the 
           sealed gate. They're acting spiteful. Unless they're stopped, 
           they'll rip the world asunder!
Gestahl:   After the Espers went on their rampage, I knew I couldn't go on 
           with my war. I asked myself why I had started it in the first 
           place. By the way... About those questions you asked me... which 
           did you ask first?
Gestahl:   Right. Anyway, more than anything I want peace. That's my true 
           dream. I want you to understand that!
Cid:       You seem a bit tired. Care for a rest break?
Gestahl:   Is there anything you wish to hear me say?
Gestahl:   I understand. I've ordered this war to be over! Now I must ask for 
           a favour...
Gestahl:   After they devastated my Empire, the Espers headed northward, 
           towards Crescent Island. They must be found...! We must tell them 
           we're no longer their enemy. After all that I have put them 
           through, it is up to me to set things right. That is why... I need 
           to borrow Terra's power. Only Terra can bridge the gap between 
           Esper and human.
Gestahl:   We must make for Crescent Island aboard the freighter from Albrook. 
           Will you accompany me?
Gestahl:   I'll have my finest warrior accompany us! General Leo!
Leo:       I'm General Leo. Nice to meet you.
Sabin:     Didn't I see you at Doma...? ...I'm SURE I did... So that was 
           General Leo...
Leo:       You! You're Cyan, liege to the King of Doma! Please forgive me for 
           not being there to stop Kefka...
Cyan:      ...... That wasn't your fault.
Leo:       I'll be waiting for you in Albrook.
Gestahl:   We must find the Espers and come to terms with them! You are our 
           last hope!

Locke:     If Terra goes, I'll go.
Terra:     Locke... Thank you...
Locke:     The rest of you wait here. I smell a rat...
Edgar:     Agreed... It's hard to trust the Emperor just like that...
Cyan:      We'll stay here and investigate.
Locke:     Please do. Leave no stone unturned!
Edgar:     Right. And you be careful!

A message from the Emperor... Because you were able to talk to so many 
soldiers, you are to be rewarded as follows.

23. ALBROOK
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Leo:       There you are. Another of the Empire's generals, and a person I 
           hired in town wil be travelling with us.
Leo:       Let me introduce... General Celes... and Shadow.
Leo:       Is something wrong?
Locke:     No...
Leo:       Our departure isnt until tomorrow. I've arranged some lodging for 
           you.
Leo:       Please, get some rest.
Terra:     Celes...
Celes:     ......
Locke:     Celes...

General Leo told us about you. By all means...

Locke:     Celes...
Locke:     Come on...! Why won't you speak to me?
Locke:     Even if it was only a little... I doubted you... But I'm still your 
           friend...
Locke:     Celes!

Leo:       Right... let's go.

Soldier:   All systems A-O-K.
Leo:       We should arrive tomorrow morning. Why not rest until then?

Leo:       You all right?
Leo:       Looks like you're feeling better...
Terra:     Funny, isn't it... I was used by the Empire... even had my thoguhts 
           ripped from me... But here I am co-operating with the "enemy"...
Leo:       People are people. Not all of us are like Kefka.
Terra:     What... What's with you?
Leo:       I knew you were being used as kind of a biological weapon... And 
           because I didn't do anything about it, I'm no different than 
           Kefka...
Terra:     I'm the product of a human and an Esper... Will I ever be able to 
           love someone?
Leo:       Of course!
Terra:     But... I haven't felt that way yet...
Leo:       You're just young,... but I understand what you mean. I understand 
           only too well...
Terra:     But... I want to know what love is... now!
Terra:     Who is it?
Shadow:    Thought I'd sleep out under the stars.
Terra:     Did you hear... ... what we were just talking about?
Shadow:    I didn't mean to overhear anything.
Terra:     Umm...
Shadow:    I can't help you. You must look within for answers.
Shadow:    Terra.
Shadow:    In this world are many like me who've killed their emotions. Don't 
           forget that.
Locke:     Urgh... Uooh... Argh...
Locke:     Ooh... Ohhhhhhh...
Locke:     I think I'm gonna...
Locke:     Watch your mouth, 'o shrouded one...
Locke:     I think I'm gonna...

Leo:       We're almost at Crescent Island. When we disembark, we'll split 
           into two groups. Celes and I will form one group. Terra, you go 
           with Locke and Shadow. If you spot the Espers, report at once!
Locke:     Let's go.
Locke:     Shadow!
Celes:     Hey... Locke...
Celes:     Um, I...
Locke:     Come on.

Whatcha want with me?

     "An elderly gentleman, pure of heart, and learned in the ways of 
      monsters..."

Strago:    Espers? Espers... Hmmm... Not really familiar with that word.
Locke:     But you've heard it before?
Strago:    Nope, unh unh... Can't say I have. Honestly can't say that I have!
That's odd...
Grandpa!
Strago:    Hey... HEY!
Strago:    What in blazes... What're you doing?

     "In her pictures she captures everything: forests, water, light... the 
      very essence of life..."

Relm:      Grandpa. Who are these people? Friends? Can they use Magic, too?
Strago:    Yaa! Hush!
Relm:      What a cute doggy!
Shadow:    Get away. He bites.
Strago:    Go to your room!
Relm:      I will not! What a fussy old man!
Strago:    Please.... leave us!
Relm:      Well... all right...
Strago:    Hoo boy... Seems to like your dog...
Relm:      Here boy!
Strago:    This is terrible...
Strago:    Sorry.
Shadow:    No problem. The dog usually doesn't like people, though...
Strago:    Please excuse her. She's just young.
Locke:     Hmmm...
Strago:    This is just a back-water village. We can tell you nothing about 
           your Espers...
Locke:     I see... There's something wrong here...
Terra:     Let's have a look around.
Locke:     Thanks for your time!
Strago:    Sorry I couldn't have been more helpful!
Shadow:    Interceptor! Come!
Relm:      Oh, all right...

Strago:    This is awful! Relm... she's...
Terra:     Relm's in danger?
Strago:    Yes! She was at a neighbour's house when a fire broke out. I won't 
           be able to stand it if something happens to her!
Strago:    Please! Won't you help!?
Locke:     Shadow!
Shadow:    Interceptor... Where are you!?

Strago:    Relm's inside that house!
Strago:    Relm!!!!!
Locke:     What're you doing?
Flames be GONE!!!
Mayor:     Magic is forbidden!
Terra:     Magic..!?
Strago:    I don't care! Relm's inside!!
Flames be GONE!!!
Mayor!!
Mayor:     All right. We really have no choice.
Mayor:     Stand back.
Flames be GONE!!!
Flames be GONE!!!
Flames be GONE!!!
Strago:    It's no use. The fire's too strong!
Mayor:     I think that's because they keep so many Fire Rods in here...
Strago:    I'm going in!
Terra:     Wait... I'm going too.
Locke:     Count me in. You'd better stay out here, gramps.
Strago:    Fool! I may be old, but I'm not powerless!
Quickly!

Locke:     Try to avoid the flames.
Terra:     Easier said than done.
Strago:    Hurry! We have to find Relm!

Is this the source of our blaze...?

Strago:    Relm!! Where are you!?
Strago:    Relm!!!!!
Uwaaa!! Too late!!
Shadow:    Let's get outta here! I'll use a Smoke Bomb!!

Strago:    Are you okay?
Relm:      Yes. Thanks, Grandpa!
Strago:    Save your thanks for these people.
Relm:      Thank you...
Strago:    I guess our town's little secret is out now...
Locke:     Can everyone here use Magic? What's going on here?
Strago:    This is... the village of the Mage Warriors...
Strago:    Long ago humans used Magicite to gain magical powers. They came to 
           be known as Mage warriors.
Locke:     But I thought they perished centuries ago...
Strago:    After the War of the Magi, the Espers fled to their new world 
           behind the sealed gate. They wished to live peacefully, without 
           fear of being used by humans. They left us here to fend for 
           ourselves... But we were despised by normal people. Everyone felt 
           we had begun that war...
Strago:    They sent people to hunt us down like animals. There weren't even 
           any trials...
Terra:     Even though the only difference was that you could use Magic...?
Strago:    A few Mage Warriors escaped and found their way here. They were our
           ancestors. Our powers have weakened over time, but some of it 
           remains.
Terra:     Look, if you're up to it, we could use your help.
Strago:    So, you're after the Espers, eh...?
Strago:    Well, I owe you for saving Relm. I'll help you find your Espers.
Relm:      Me too!
Strago:    I dont think so.
Relm:      What a fuddy duddy...
Locke:     But... where do we start looking?
Strago:    Hmmm... If they're here, they must be hiding in the mountains to 
           the west.
Locke:     Why there?
Strago:    Those mountains have powerful magical properties. They say the 
           Espers were created there...
Terra:     Maybe they're drawn to that place?
Locke:     I think it's worth a look.

Shadow:    Don't misunderstand me. I just wanted my dog back.
Locke:     Going somewhere?
Shadow:    I'll search for the Espers in my own way.
Shadow:    Interceptor. Come!

25. ESPER'S GATHERING PLACE
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Strago:    I can't believe it... The Statues...!
Terra:     The "Statues"!?
Locke:     Some faint figures are carved on the back of the stone figures...
Locke:     Say, old man, what else can you tell us about these Goddesses?
Strago:    They quite literally created Magic, as we know it.
Locke:     So, they're the Goddesses of Magic, then?
Strago:    You could say that.
Terra:     I can feel their power...
Strago:    The Statues are the source of all magic. It's said that the Espers
           made these images, and put them in a very special place. These 
           represent power beyond all comprehension...
Terra:     Our Espers no doubt came to this island to bask in all this magical
           power!
Locke:     Say, old timer, what happened to the Stone Goddesses?
Strago:    Legend has it that they're hidden somewhere beyond the reach of 
           humans. I'd say they're beyond the sealed gate...
Terra:     I wonder if the barrier that protects that place is generate by 
           those stone Goddesses?
Locke:     Phew... what a story.
Terra:     If the Espers were attracted here by these Statues, they must be 
           around here somewhere!
Locke:     I think it's worth a look.

Ultros:    G'heh, heh... These shiny statues are all mine! These will get 
           Ziegfried's attention!
Ultros:    Oh! They're glowing!! They're... beautiful!
Locke:     Hey, squidball! Don't you ever learn?
Ultros:    Uh, well they always said I was a slow learner... but I eat FAST!!

I was just thinking about you! I've more lives than I do arms!
Hope I'm not making a nuisance of myself! So sorry!
Relm:      Grandpa! I'm here...!
Strago:    Relm! I told you to stay at home!
Relm:      I couldn't miss the chance to practice my drawing! Say, sweetie, 
           who are you?
Ultros:    How dare you! I'm Ultros!!
Locke:     Relm and Ultros... What ARE you doing...?
Relm:      Listen, Ulty... Why don't you pose for me?
Ultros:    I'm not one of your kiddy friends! Don't talk to me as if I were!! 
           I don't want a portrait!
Relm:      Forget it! I don't wanna draw it anymore!
Relm:      It's okay... I'll just jump down from here.
Terra:     No!! You can't do that!!!
Whisper, whisper...
Terra:     How dare you bother that little girl! I'm not going to forgive you 
           if you hurt her!
Ultros:    Well, whadduya want I should do?
Locke:     Ask her to draw your portrait. She may actually make you look 
           pleasant!
Locke:     Don't be so heartless!
Ultros:    ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... Oh, all right, Uncle Ulty REALLY 
           wants you to do his portrait!!!
Relm:      Hee, hee, hee... You're gonna love it!
Strago:    At any rate, come here!
How can this be? I... I'm nothing more than a stupid octopus!

Relm:      Hey! Did you see me? I was awesome! Wouldn't I be more helpful than 
           Gramps?
Strago:    G... GRAMPS!!?
Terra:     I suppose it wouldn't hurt to have you along...
Strago:    All right all ready! If you insist...
Relm:      That's better!

Relm:      Are these... Espers!?
Strago:    What about you?
Terra:     I didn't think they'd look so...
Locke:     Gramps, take Relm and clear outta here!
Yura:      Halt!
Relm:      What is it?
Strago:    I sense some immense magical power in Terra... It... frightens 
           me...
Locke:     I wonder if she's gonan go ballistic again!?
Yura:      You're somehow different... I sense a familiar power radiating from 
           you...
Terra:     Yes.
Strago:    You're the Espers that fled through the sealed gate?
Yura:      As a rule, we are not allowed to visit your world. We few had 
           gathered near the gate, and were wondering how we could save the 
           Espers that had been kidnapped. It was just a coincidence that 
           Terra appeared when she did...
Terra:     I felt... your presence... through the gate.
Yura:      We bolted the moment Terra opened the gate. But once in your world, 
           we lost control of our powers.
Yura:      We completely levelled a city... and took some innocent lives...
Terra:     That's what happened to me! I lost all control of my power...
Strago:    There must be something in your world that allows you to focus your 
           power differently. You must use caution while in our world...
Yura:      We are deeply sorry to have caused you humans such suffering and 
           pain.
Locke:     The past is history. The Empire seems to want to talk peace with 
           you. Why not come with us?
Yura:      They would forgive us so easily?
Locke:     Let's go to Thamasa and talk with General Leo.
Terra:     Right!

Locke:     General Leo.
Leo:       Locke... you're back! And you've made the Espers understand our 
           desire for peace!
Leo:       I am General Leo. May I have your name, please?
Yura:      I am called Yura.
Yura:      We have done something inexcusable to your people.
Yura:      This probably isnt the time or place to ask for your forgiveness, 
           but...
Leo:       Speak no further. It is we who owe you an apology. We hungered for 
           your power... How close we came to re-enacting the War of the 
           Magi!!!
Yura:      We must put this all behind us.
Locke:     I believe our job is finally over! I, for one, could use some peace 
           and quiet...
Celes:     Let's return to Vector.
Locke:     Celes...
Celes:     Please, not another word.
Relm:      I'm too hot, Grandpa.
Strago:    Kids!!
Kefka:     Hee, hee...! How about a little Magitek mayhen!
Leo:       Kefka! What ARE you doing!?
Kefka:     G'ha, ha, ha! Emperor's orders! I'm to bring the Magicite remains 
           of these Espers to his excellency! Behold! A Magicite mother lode!!
Kefka:     Idiots!
Kefka:     I don't care for the appearance of this pitiful little hamlet... So 
           burn it!!
Leo:       Kefka! No!
Kefka:     Shut up!

Leo:       Kefka! Your behaviour is dishonourable! I can't allow this!
Kefka:     Ah... Leo... Always the consummate solder...
Leo:       Where are you, Kefka... Show yourself!!
Kefka:     E M P E R O R G E S T A H L... I need you here...
Emperor Gestahl: Leo...
Leo:       My liege!
I'm sorry I decieved even you, Leo. My purpose has been to gather Magicite, 
and grow powerful... Please understand me...
Leo:       But Emperor...!
Gestahl:   Don't say anything. I understand how you feel.
Kefka:     Uwee, hee, hee... That's right! What we have to do now is collect 
           Magicite!
Leo:       But my liege... what have I been fighting for...?
Gestahl:   Leo, I'd like you to take a nice long snooze...! Very long! Uwa, 
           ha!
Leo:       !!!
Kefka:     So... you think you hit me!? That was simply my shadow! And how did 
           you like my Gestahl? I should've been on the stage! Well, 
           General... You're such a goody two-shoes!
Leo:       Shut up, Kefka! I oughtta...
Kefka:     Oh! A threat...? You're such a violent little brute! I'll tell your 
           "liege" I had to exterminate a traitor...!
Kefka:     Hate... hate... HATE!!
Kefka:     Whoa! Yes, I feel some incredible Magic power here. today! Wave 
           after wave of pure, magical energy...

Wait! We're here to help!
Hurry!
Get going!

Kefka:     I'd say you're all charged up, boys and girls ...or whatever... 
           Say, remind me to show you my Magicite collection someday! You 
           might see a few familiar faces!!!
Kefka:     Now for a little Magicite hocus-pocus...!
Kefka:     First, let's neutralize your abilities.
Kefka:     Now, little Espers... Let's see whatcha got!
Kefka:     Eh!? You wanna take me on? Fine. Here I am...
Kefka:     Imagine! Thinking you could defeat ME!! This is rich! Mwa, ha, ha!
Kefka:     Now, my little Magicite pretties... come, and help me build the 
           magical empire of "Kefka"!
Kefka:     G'haw, haw... Ooh, they're warm to the touch! What treasures!
Kefka:     This is ridiculous! I had no idea you were such wimps! Time to put 
           a stop to all of this.
Kefka:     Phew... I think I have plenty of Magicite for the time being... 
           That is, until I make my way through your precious sealed gate!!
Kefka:     I don't believe this!

Terra:     General Leo...
Terra:     People only seem to want power. Do they really want to be like me?
Terra:     I... I wanted to learn so much more from you...
Interceptor!? That's a nasty wound!
Locke:     We not only lost Leo, but Shadow, too... Curse the Empire!
Locke:     This'll have to do...
Celes:     He was so gentle..
Relm:      I'll go with you.
Locke:     Now I'm worried about Edgar and the others...
Terra:     I wish I could say they were safe...
Setzer:    We've been had!! The Emperor is a liar!
Cyan:      Thanks to Edgar, we escaped before anything bad happened...
Locke:     Way to go, Edgar!
Edgar:     I got to know the gal who brought us tea. After a while, she just 
           blurted out the whole crooked plan.
Sabin:     So... you finally hit pay dirt, eh?
Edgar:     Watch your mouth! There're ladies present! I was a perfect 
           gentleman!
Locke:     General Leo's gone... Kefka did him in...
Cyan:      Sir Leo!? Gone!? What a waste... He was their finest soldier...
Edgar:     We need to rethink our plans. Let's return to the airship.
Strago:    May I accompany you?
Edgar:     Who're you?
Locke:     He's one of this town's citizens.
Terra:     He's descended from the Mage Warriors of yore... I think he can be 
           a big help.
Strago:    We must expect the Empire to flex it's new-found muscle soon.
Relm:      Me too!
Strago:    I don't think so.
Sabin:     Yeah, right kid!
Relm:      What? Who is this puffed-up aerobics instructor, anyway?
Sabin:     Kid's got quite a lip!
Relm:      Aaack! I'm gonna paint your portrait!
Uwaaa! S...stop!
Strago:    All right all ready! If you insist...
Relm:      That's better!
Sabin:     Let's go!
Relm:      What's wrong, lover boy?
Edgar:     How old are you?
Relm:      10... why?
Relm:      I'm coming along, too.
Edgar:     You've grown up entirely too fast! Lighten up, okay!?

Setzer:    The Empire's after the Sealed gate! They're looking for some 
           statues or something.
Strago:    No!!!
Gestahl:   Oh, those silly Espers! To think they opened the gate themselves! 
           The Statues should be just ahead. If we can just get our hands on 
           them, we'll have everything we ever dreamed of!
Gestahl:   Come quickly!
Celes:     What's wrong, Terra?
Terra:     The island... The world is groaning in pain...
Gestahl:   Fuwa, ha, ha! Now THIS is power! This, and my Magicite... now 
           nothing can stop me!
Strago:    The beginning of all Magic...
Terra:     Those?
Strago:    It is said that they somehow neutralized each other's power, then 
           sealed themselves away...
Strago:    If the 3 statues should ever be moved out of alignment, the 
           resulting imbalance of power would... ...rearrange the face of our 
           planet...
Terra:     What!?

Setzer:    Quick! Let's jump onto that thing!



=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
26. THE FLOATING CONTINENT
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Uh oh!!! The Imperial Air Force (IAF)!
We're surrounded! Let's give em a bloody lip!
Something... curious... approaches!

No, really, this is our LAST battle! Trust me!
Ultros:    I lose AGAIN! Well, today I've brought a pal! Mr. Chupon, come on 
           down!
Chupon:    Fungahhh!
Ultros:    Mr. Chupon's taciturn, but terribly powerful!
Ultros:    Better not irritate him! He gets hungry when he's irritated... 
Ultros:    I was drowsing the other day when Mr. Chupon gnawed on my head! He 
           needed something to polish his teeth on!

Kefka, Gestahl... and the Statues are just ahead.

Shadow:    Down with the Empire! Once I outlived my usefulness, they tried to 
           off me!
"We thought you were a goner!"
Shadow:    Is Interceptor all right?
"He's fine. Come on, let's go!"
Shadow:    Forget about me.
"We can't just leave you!"

My name is Atma... I am pure energy, and as ancient as the cosmos. Feeble 
creatures, DIE!
Vast energy focused on Atma!

Shadow:    I sold my skills to the Empire... I have no right to fight together 
           with you.

Gestahl:   Well, well...
Gestahl:   Fwa, ha, ha... Then you're just in time to perish. Behold! The 
           Statues!!
Gestahl:   Ooh! I've got goose bumps! What power...
Celes:     Emperor Gestahl! Please, stop this madness!
Gestahl:   Celes... Come to me, my pretty! You and Kefka were given life to 
           serve me!! It is your birthright to rule the world with me!!
Kefka:     Kill the others and we'll overlook your treachery!
Kefka:     Take this sword! Take care of them. Immediately!!
Gestahl:   Celes... together we can rule an entire world! Think of it...!
Celes:     Power only breeds war... I wish I'd never been born.
Kefka:     Ouch!!
Kefka:     B... Blood!?
Kefka:     You... vicious brat! Grrr... Aargh... I hate hate hate hate hate 
           hate... hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate HATE YOU! 
           Grrr...
Kefka:     Goddesses... you were born only to fight. I implore you... show me 
           your power!!
Kefka:     I command you! Give me your power! Arrrgh! Curses!
Kefka:     Listen to me, or you'll regret it! Give me... POWER!
Gestahl:   Kefka, stop it! Revive those statues, and you'll destroy the very 
           world we're trying to possess!
Kefka:     Shuddap!
Gestahl:   Kefka! Are you nuts!?
Kefka:     Nuts...!? Emperor! Don't disturb me! I'm showing them the meaning 
           of power!
Gestahl:   I don't think so, friend. Your days are now over.
Gestahl:   Now relax... I'm simply going to put you to sleep with the very 
           power you unleashed...
Gestahl:   What's so funny!?
Gestahl:   Very well. It is only fitting that you go to sleep laughing!
Fire 3!!!
Flare!!!!
Gestahl:   N... noooo!! Why isn't my magic working!?
Melton!!!
Gestahl:   K... Kefka!!!!! H... how...!?
Gestahl:   How are you doing this!?
Kefka:     How? Simple! I'm standing within the field of the Statues! Their 
           strong field absorbs all magic sent their way! Or didn't you 
           notice!?
Gestahl:   ...!!!
Kefka:     And now, Statues! You've shown me a sign! It is time you show this 
           old man your true power!
Gestahl:   No! Kefka!! Don't do something stupid...
Kefka:     I command you, Statues!!! Show me your power!!!
Kefka:     I... incredible!
Kefka:     You're way off!!!! Where are you aiming!?
Kefka:     Whoa! More to the right!
Kefka:     Run! Run! Or you'll be well done!
Kefka:     YES!!!!
Kefka:     Poor old... Oh well, what a worthless excuse of an Emperor!!
Gestahl:   There'll be no-one to worship us...
Celes:     Snap out of it, Kefka!
Celes:     Oh, that's really smart, Kefka! Disturb their delicate balance, and 
           they'll go haywire...!
Kefka:     Who're you?
Kefka:     Noooo!
Shadow:    Go! There are people counting on you!
Shadow:    Don't worry about me! Run!! I can't stop this chain reaction! I'll 
           see you again. Count on it!
Kefka:     You can't escape me!!
Shadow! Get out of here on the double!

Mwa ha ha...... You can't run!

"Shadow!!"
Shadow:    I'll be blown to bits before I can even collect my pay...
Can't you diffuse the statues!?
Setzer:    Hang on!

On that day, the world was changed forever...

Cid:       You're finally awake...
Celes:     I... feel like I've been sleeping forever...
Cid:       For one year, actually... I thought you were out for good.
Celes:     A whole year... You've watched over me the whole time?
Cid:       Yes, and I'm about out of energy.
Cid:       We're on a tiny, deserted island. After the world crumbled, I awoke 
           to find us here together with... a few strangers.
Celes:     The world...! So, it wasn't just a dream.
Celes:     Where are my friends? Where's Locke...?
Cid:       I don't know. I only know we're here... Maybe we're the only people 
           left alive...
Cid:       Since that day, the world's continued it's slide into ruin. Animals 
           and plants are dying... The few others who washed up here with us 
           passed away of boredom and despair.
Celes:     My friends... they're probably all gone...
Cid:       Celes... you're the closest thing to family that I have... we could 
           just live out our lives here peacefully...
Celes:     I suppose so, Cid... or should I say, Granddad? Can I call you 
           that?
Cid:       Gramps, eh? I'm overwhelmed! All of a sudden I have a 
           granddaughter! Cough... Wheeze...
Celes:     My long-lost Granddad...
Cid:       Ha, ha... Hack... Cough!
Celes:     Hey, are you hungry?
Cid:       I... I haven't eaten in about 3 or so days, ever since I became 
           ill.
Celes:     What would you like?
Cid:       Well, unless I ask for fish, I won't get anything! That's all there 
           is here!
Celes:     I'll go catch some.

Cid:       I... I'm not long for this cruel, new world...

Cid:       My worst nightmare is to think of you alone here on this wretched 
           island... hack... wheeze!!

Cid:       Cough... hack... ACK!! While I can still talk, I... wheeze... 
           pant... want to thank you... cough!

......
Celes:     Granddad. You have to eat, or else... W...What's the matter?
Celes:     Cid...
Celes:     No... NO!! You promised you'd stay here with me!!
Celes:     Granddad, ANSWER ME! Tell me you're just joking!

Cid:       Those others who were here... when they were feeling down they'd 
           take a leap of faith from the cliffs up north... perked 'em right 
           up!
Celes:     Everyone's gone... Even Locke, who promised to watch over me... The 
           world's slowly ebbing away...

Celes:     Phew... Why did you nurse me back to health? Did I ever ask you to 
           help me!?
Celes:     A bandana??? No... it can't be...
Celes:     Hey, you! Where'd you get this!? Is the person who healed you still 
           alive? Answer me!
Celes:     He's alive... Locke's still alive!!!

You need to leave! The others are surely waiting for you! Find the stairs next 
to the stove. Down them lies your road to freedom.
                                             Love, Granddad.

Celes:     I'll make you proud of me... Granddad...

Celes:     I thought everyone was gone... I had given up all hope... But... 
           fortunately, I was wrong! Now I know they're all alive! We need to

Celes:     Don't play possum with me! Edgar? Or have you somehow lost your

Gerad:     Listen. my lady, I've been "Gerad" all my life!

Gerad:     Get going!
Celes:     Edgar!
Edgar:     What're ya waiting for, Celes? Give me a hand!!
Celes:     Edgar! It IS you!

Celes:     Why the stupid farce?
Edgar:     Well, I heard that Figaro had had an accident. I wanted to help, 
           but didnt know where to look. Then I heard that those idiots had 
           escaped from the prison.
Celes:     You needed to use them...
Edgar:     Bingo. I had to wait until they led me to their secret cave.
Celes:     Amazing, considering that you threw most of 'em in jail to begin 
           with!
Sabin:     Don't treat us like strangers anymore!
Edgar:     Uh, oh...! Let's hide!
Boss! ......? Boss? Must have been eaten by that thing...
It wasn't even much of a monster... Well, let's go...
"You don't want that treasure back...?"
Edgar:     It's completely worthless. Besides, Kefka's the one we need to 
           worry about. Those guys haven't committed any serious crimes...
Celes:     Come on, let's go...

Celes:     What are you saying!?
Setzer:    I'm just a gambler... I just want to be left alone... This world is 
           too chaotic for me. What's worse, I've lost my wings...
Celes:     But before the world collapsed, you fought with all your heart! You 
           were absolutely fearless...
Setzer:    That was then... We can never have that world back!
Celes:     You want to live in this world as it is? No? Then do something

Setzer:    Could be anything lurking down here, so keep your eyes peeled!

DARYL SLEEPS HERE

Setzer:    This brings back a lot of memories.

Daryl:     This experimental airship is probably a bit unstable...
Setzer:    You can't be serious! What are you trying to prove!?

Setzer:    Watch your step.

Daryl:     If something should happen to me, the Falcon's yours!
Setzer:    Nonsense! I'll win the Falcon from you when I whip you in a race!
Setzer:    You'd better clear outta my way!
Daryl:     Big talk, buster!

Setzer:    There's nothing like flying!
Daryl:     Come on! Stop lagging back there!
Daryl:     Or do you like chewing on my wake!
Setzer:    Listen to you!
Daryl:     This time's for real. I'm going to break every record! I'll be 
           known as the woman who flew closest to the stars!
Setzer:    Be back before sunset! I'll be waiting for you on our hill.
The wreck of the Falcon was found a full year later, in a distant land...

Setzer:    I restored the craft, and then put it to rest down here.
Edgar:     This is THE Falcon?
Setzer:    I put it in storage. I couldn't bear to look at it. But now it just 
           may save us...

Edgar:     I finally think we're gonna pull this off!
Celes:     We can attack Kefta's tower from the air!
Edgar:     The Falcon's going to give us one last chance at that guy...
Setzer:    But first we need to find our friends!
Edgar:     Right. First things first. For once I feel hopeful!
Celes:     Hey! A bird!
Celes:     Setzer! Follow that bird!
Setzer:    But why?
Celes:     I... don't know...! Something inside just tells me it's

Lola:      Look, my boyfriend in Mobliz sent me all these flowers! They're all 
           hand-made of silk. And these are letters he has written to me...
??? But wasn't Mobliz demolished by Kefka? Somebody else must have written 
these...

My beloved Lola,
     We're still busy trying to rebuild this town... If all goes well I'll be 
     able to come home to you soon...

Cyan!!
Cyan:      Hey!! You're alive!?
Cyan...
Cyan:      I shall go with you! I shan't leave the world as it is! But how did 
           you find me? W... Wait! Tell me you didn't read my letters...!!
Cyan:      These... They're... um... Merely a diversion of mine...
Cyan, these flowers are gorgeous!
Cyan:      Mm...m...!? This is an outrage...!
Cyan:      Seriously?
Cyan:      I learned of that poor girl when I passed through Maranda. When I 
           heard that she sent a letter each day, but never recieved any 
           replies... Something inside me snapped...
Cyan:      As I wrote to that girl, I realized I was very much like her. I was 
           looking behind... full of despair. My eyes were closed... And then 
           something changed... I bumped into Sir Gau in Maranda. He said he 
           had to become stronger if he was to face Kefka. He probably 
           returned to the Veldt.

Uwaaa! Someone's coming!!

You're gonna have to fight your way in here, chumps!!
Wait!
Terra!!
Mama! Are these your friends!?
Terra:     Oh! I'm so glad to see that you're safe! I've missed you!
"Terra... come on, let's go! Unless we stop Kefka, all's lost..."
Terra:     I...

Terra:     That is I... um... I can't fight any longer...
Terra:     The very day the world fell, Kefka turned some kind of beam on this 
           town. Almost all of the adults perished trying to save their 
           children...
It's heading this way! Protect the kids!!
Terra:     There were only children here... The moment I arrived, I felt 
           needed...
Duane:     You can't take Terra away!
Katrin:    Duane... Please excuse him. It's just that if Terra goes, she takes 
           with her the very spirit of our survival...
Terra:     I don't know why these kids need me... But they've made me feel 
           things I've never felt before. The moment I sensed this, I lost my 
           will to fight.
Terra:     I can honestly say I don't know what's going on inside of me... And 
           the more I try to understand it, the less inclined I am to fight.

Help!!! Run!!! Phunbaba's coming!!!
Terra:     Phunbaba's an ancient demon who was released when the world was 
           undone.

Terra!! Wake up! Uh, oh... here it comes!

Terra:     I've really lost it... My fighting edge...
Mama! Are you okay!?
Terra:     I'm staying here. As you can see, I can't be of any help to you. 
           And besides, the children really need me.
Celes:     But Terra...!
Terra:     Maybe after a little more time passes... I need to understand 
           what's happening to me...

Thanks for scaring Phunbaba away. In his haste, he dropped this. Here!

Terra:     Hey you guys!
Terra:     Katrin's having a baby.
Katrin:    I'm so happy to have had a child... but Duane seems miserable...
Duane:     Katrin... ... I'm sorry. I didn't know how to handle this. I've 
           been an awful husband. But I'm learning. Please, come back with me.
Waaaaa! Phunbaba's back again!

Terra!!

Monster again... I'm afraid... I'm always afraid...
Mama... It is you, isn't it! I can tell...
Huh? Mama? Terra?
Mama!! Terra!!!!
Terra:     I... I can fight!
Terra:     Finally... I understand that feeling... Even though I kept it 
           buried for so long. I'm sure it's called... ...... ...... "Love"! I 
           now realize we must fight for the future of the children.
Terra:     Duane... Katrin needs your help... so does your new baby. Listen 
           children, your "Mama" has to go away for a while. I'll return when 
           I feel your future's guaranteed!
"Mama.. I'm not gonna cry!" "Me either!"
Terra:     I'll be back! I promise! Till then... you behave!
Terra:     Thank you... You helped me to understand a part of myself. Now I 
           must go to war. We must all believe we have a future. We must fight 
           for those who aren't even born yet!

Owzer:     P... please... Help that painting!!
"The painting!?"
Owzer:     It's... There's a monster hiding in my prized painting of a 
           goddess...
"A monster!?"
Owzer:     Yes... And now it's nearly impossible to get it to show itself...
Relm:      Ahhhhh!!
Owzer:     Relm! We can't attack this masterpiece! It would be inexcusable!
Chardarnook: G'fu, fu, fu... Who're these numbskulls? No one... NO ONE... is 
           going to remove me from this fine new painting!

Demon:     The girl in the picture is mine. You can't have her!

Relm:      Hey! Relax! The monster croaked!
Owzer:     Thanks for saving the day! This picture's more precious to me than 
           my own life!
Relm:      Huh!? What are you talking about?
"Now... what was a monster doing in that picture!?"
Owzer:     It all started when I bought a stone at the Auction House. I took 
           one look at it and suddenly felt I needed a portrait of Starlet. I 
           asked several artists, but none could muster enough skill. It was 
           then that I heard about Relm's amazing ability. I brought her here, 
           and put her to work. But while she was painting, that thing came 
           along... It must have been enticed here by that stone.
Where is the stone...?
Owzer:     The stone? Over on that bookshelf.

"This is Magicite..."
Owzer:     Phew. I don't need any more bad luck. Just take it and go!
Relm:      I have to go! But fear not, I'll be back to finish this painting!
Owzer:     I'll be waiting for you!

           without me! He's somewhere in the mines. Once we find him, I'll 
           order him to join us!

Esper:     You HUMANS freed me from that prison of ice? You possess Magicite!? 
           Who are you!? I sense war and destruction... Could that stupid war 
           possibly have lasted a thousand years? I can tell that you want to 
           put a stop to the madness... Let's see if you are worthy!

What's with this carving? Looks like bone...
Something... in that eye... Magicite!?

Mog:       I'm your boss, kupo! You're gonna join us, kupo!!!

     "Admirer of bone carvings, as strong as a gigas, a yeti pal with muscle!"

Ooh... me Umaro... Yes, boss... me join you!
Mog:       Umaro! No slouching, now!
Ooh... me wait for you in big airship!

Locke:     You're all safe! Behold...  A legendary relic that can restore 
           life...
That looks like... Magicite...
Locke:     Correct! Legend has it that ages ago the Phoenix was turned into 
           stone... And many legends are based on facts... This has some major 
           cracks in it though...I fear it may have lost it's power over 
           time...
Locke:     I wasn't able to save Rachel... I've lost all sense of purpose...

Patriarch: Uwaaaaaa! The Magicite's gonna shatter!
Rachel:    Locke...
Locke:     Rachel!!!!
Rachel:    Locke... I've dreamed of seeing you. I wanted to hear your voice.
Locke:     Rachel...
Rachel:    The Phoenix has given me so little time... I have to leave again 
           soon... But I have something I must tell you...
Locke:     ......
Rachel:    Locke... ... With you I was so happy... In the instant that the 
           accident occured, I thought only of you... And about the joy you 
           brought me. Thank you, Locke... I'll never forget you...
Locke:     Rachel!!!!
Rachel:    I have to go now... ...I'll always love you... You must now cast 
           off the anguish you've been harbouring inside for so long... Today 
           I set your heart free. You must learn to love yourself again, and 
           regain your self respect. ...... Phoenix! Be reborn again!! And 
           give your power... to Locke!!
Locke:     Rachel!!!

Celes:     Locke...
Locke:     Thanks, I'm okay... I feel lighter than air... From here on... I'll 
           be all right. Let's go! We have work to do!!
Celes:     What's up?

      should we ask...?"

Creature:  I am Gogo, master of the simulacrum... My miming skills will 
           astonish you.
Gogo:      Yes... I have been idle for too long. If I deem you worthy, I'll 
           mime your actions in battle. But first you must tell me what you're 
           doing here.
Gogo:      What an unusual tale... But I sense that you're trying to help make 
           things right again. This should be fun. When do we leave?

We're the 3 Dream Stooges!
Good, everyone's here! Let's rumble!

Please... Save my husband... Save Cyan...
Where are we!?
We're inside... Cyan's soul... My husband... Cyan continues to torture 
himself... He failed to defend Doma... The world's slowly dying... and then 
there's his family...
A beast known as Wrexsoul is taking advantage of him. Wrexsoul is a composite 
monster, made up of wretched spirits who were dispatched in meaningless wars. 
They're wreaking havoc on Papa! Please help him!
Please... help Cyan... 
Papa doesn't deserve this!

You must be Wrexsoul! We want Cyan back!!
You're too late! His pain has reached critical mass! Nothing can stop his 
feelings of rage and despair! I grow stronger now with his anger, hatred and 
guilt! And I hunger for... you!

Wrexsoul:  I'm gonna possess your body! I'll only appear in this form again 
           when you're about to expire!

Cyan:      Thanks be to you.
Cyan:      I heard my wife and children calling out to me! Their voices 
           finally gave me the strength and courage to come to grips with my 
           own suffering.
Cyan:      Elayne! Owain!
You did it, Cyan!
Papa's strong!!
Cyan:      No... I didn't do anything... then... and I can't now... I'm a man 
           with no honour...
No! You have entirely too much...
My beloved... we'll always be together...
Papa... we love you!
We'll always be... at your side...
Cyan:      Elayne and Owain live on in my heart. I must leave the past behind. 
           I have much to live for...
Cyan's soul cleared itself of all doubt and confusion. Cyan's swordsmanship 
attained it's peak level of skill.

Relm:      Yea!! We're back! It's like old times!
Strago:    Time to relax! Home sweet home!
Grandpa!
Relm:      This is terrible! Gungho's hurt!
Strago:    G...Gungho!?
Strago:    Gungho, wake up!
Strago:    Who did this to you?
Gungho:    It was... Hidon, the beat you and I used to hunt. I almost had 
           it...
Strago:    You took on Hidon...?
Gungho:    Oooh... cough, cough....
Strago:    G... Gungho!?
Gungho:    Strago... Please... you must avenge me...
Gungho:    Oooh... cough, cough....
Relm:      Gramps! Why are you hesitating!
Strago:    Well... I spent my youth chasing that creature. To do it again at 
           this age is more than I bargained for.
Strago:    Gungho... rest easy, I'll do it for you!
Grandpa!
Relm:      Just a minute! You don't think you're going alone, do you?
Strago:    I spent too many years of my life hunting that thing. It is my 
           obsession, not yours.
Relm:      But Grandps! This "obsession" of yours could easily slay you! 
           You're my Grandfather. I can't just sit idly by and watch you go.
Strago:    Sorry, Relm. I'm so grateful that you care! But as it's name 
           implies, the Hidon is extremely difficult to find. Unless I go 
           alone, it will not show itself.
Strago:    Next stop, Ebot's Rock.
Relm:      Phew...

           by! I like to eat "Coral"! Have any?

Munch munch munch G'nnnaa! What a feast! I'm stuffed. Completely full!
Treasure:  Bluuurp! Whew!
Treasure:  Oh yeah, you wanna pass through here, right?
Treasure:  Eh!! What the...!

Strago:    That's Hidon! 

Strago:    I did it! I... I... I actually beat Hidon!
Strago:    I have to tell Gungho he is avenged!

Strago:    Gungho...!
Strago:    Gungho...!
Gungho:    What's all the hullabaloo!?
Strago:    Listen to me! I DEFEATED Hidon!
Gungho:    You WHAT!? You b...beat Hidon!? You're lying! LYING!
Relm:      No, he's not! He really defeated Hidon.
Strago:    Ho, ho, ho! If I didn't know better, I'd say that Hidon wasn't my 
           only enemy!
Gungho:    I don't believe this! This has to be a joke!
Strago:    Ho, ho, ho!!
Strago:    By the way, how are your wounds healing, Gungho?
Gungho:    Eh? Oh, they're fine...

That evening...

Strago:    There I was, in a cave that seemed endless. Then, before I knew it, 
           Hidon appeared!
Strago:    I stared Hidon straight in the eye, lifted my staff, and let him 
           have it! G'Pow! Thwack! Crash!!
Strago:    I wanted to show my enemy the true meaning of the word "Hero"!
Strago:    And then......
Relm:      What happened to Grandpa?
Gungho:    Huh? Finally! He nodded off.
Gungho:    However... Let him be! He's nice and ...quiet... Now, about my 
           "wounds"...
Relm:      Wait! First let me thank you. You gave Grandpa a reason to go and 
           defeat something that had tormented him for decades! Even if YOU 
           were faking, that creature meant business!
Gungho:    What a granddaughter he's raised! Amazing!
Relm:      And what a terrible actor you are!
Relm:      Only Strago could have been taken in by that performance!
Gungho:    What the...!

There's something odd about this stratum... I have to get to the bottom of 
this...

What the...?
It's an Esper attack! Let's show him some of OUR Esper Magic!
A 1000 years ago in the past, a battle was waged here...
"Only Odin is here!"
"Are your wounds healed?"
We're fresh outta options. We'll have to leave this battle in Odin's hands...
A city, ruined during the War of the Magi...
Atom Edge!
Atom Edge!
Odin:      Don't do it... You can't turn me into Magicite...
There's an ancient legend... It tells of a battle between Odin and a powerful 
sorcerer that took place in a great hall of the castle...

Odin turned into a Magicite shard...

A book, with a gem-encrusted cover... "Queen's Diary"
I realize, now, that I am in love with Odin... This... breaks every rule of 
our society. But my heart longs for this noble, elegant man. How could anyone 
blame me? After the fighting is over I'm going to bare my soul to him...

Even the Queen was turned into stone...
A tear comes... from the stone...?
The Magicite "Odin" gains a level... and becomes the Magicite "Raiden"!

Gau:       Uooo...
Sabin:     Come on, Gau. It's true, right?
Gau:       ...fffatherrr...?
Sabin:     Yes. This is definitely your father.
Gau:       ......??? ...Gau's... father!? Oooogauoooo!
Sabin:     Right!! Let's go tell your father the news! He needs to know you're 
           his son!
Sabin:     Just a minute... We can't just go there with you looking like this.
Sabin:     I know! Let's go to Jidoor and give you a make-over!

Sabin:     No, Gau! Don't eat with your fingers!
Gau:       Yaoooo...
Sabin:     Don't say "Yaoooo" when you mean "Yes"!
Gau:       Ho!
Sabin:     ......

           becomes Gau? 
Well...

"Not at..."
Cyan:      Wait a minute! Where's the hat?

Gau:       This is it! Me go to funeral?
Sabin:     Perfect! Functional yet sporty! Done!
"I don't think..."
Setzer:    Phew! Completely lacking in fashion!
Setzer:    Excuse me, sir. Could you order some clothes like the ones I'm 
           wearing?
Impossible!
Setzer! How dare you think of sticking him in that kinda getup!?

Sabin:     Okay, Gau? Now, any father'd be glad to have a son like you!
Gau:       Hooo...

Aged Man:  ...son?
Sabin:     Right. The truth is, he's alive! Come here, Gau!
Gau:       Fffatherrr...
Aged Man:  What is this!? What's with this "son" business? I never had a son!
Aged Man:  But now that you mention it, I once had a terrible dream. In it, a 
           demon-child was born! I grabbed the creature, and rushed off to the 
           Veldt with it... It was crying like crazy when I arrived on the 
           Veldt.
Sabin:     But, Sir...!
Aged Man:  I left the child there... And without looking back, I turned and 
           started to run.
Sabin:     I'm trying to tell you...
Aged Man:  Suddenly the crying stopped. I turned around and saw a frightful 
           monster... Hideous! Still gives me the shakes.
Sabin:     I give up...
Aged Man:  But you, young man, your parents must be proud of you! I still have 
           dreams of that demon child... Frightening...
Sabin:     Why! You old... He's completely lost his mind! Gau, I'm gonna 
           clobber him!!
Gau:       Uwaooo... ooooo...

Sabin:     I... I'm sorry...

1. THE TOWER

Right. We're going in!

Edgar:     It's time to break into Kefka's domain!
Setzer:    What's wrong? Celes......
Celes:     The Statues give the Espers the magical energy they need to live. 
           If we destroy the Statues...
Edgar:     What'll happen?
Celes:     I'm really not sure, but...
Strago:    The Espers... and Magic, too, will most definitely disappear from 
           this world.
Edgar:     And then...
Celes:     What will happen to ...Terra...?

The Statues are up ahead...

Ran basic program!
Included battle program!
Ran Ultros' battle program!

Doom's aura is shaking!
Wind-elemental ineffectual!
Fire-elemental ineffectual!

Defeat the Statues, and magical power will not disappear... Kefka drained the 
Statues' power, the source of Magic...?



=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
2. THE FINAL SHOWDOWN
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Welcome, friends! I knew you'd make it here, so I've prepared some suitable 
entertainment for you!
How long are you going to let the destruction continue?
Kefka:     I've tapped into the ultimate power. Observe...!
Kefka:     Such magnificent power! You are like insects to me!
Kefka:     I will exterminate everyone, and everything!
People will keep rebuilding the things you take from them!
Kefka:     Then I'll destroy those too. Why do people rebuild things they know 
           are going to be destroyed? Why do people cling to life when they 
           know they can't live forever? Think how meaningless each of your 
           lives is!
It's not the net result of one's life that's important! It's the day-to-day 
concerns, the personal victories, and the celebration of life... and love! 
It's enough if people are able to experience the joy that each day can bring!
Kefka:     And have you found your "joy" in this nearly dead world of ours?
Yes!
Terra:     I know what love is...!
Locke:     And I have learned to celebrate life... and the living.
Cyan:      My family lives on inside of me.
Shadow:    I know what friendship is... and family...
Edgar:     It is my dream to build a kingdom in which I can guarantee freedom 
           and dignity.
Sabin:     I have come to experience anew the love of my brother...
Celes:     I've met someone who can accept me for what I am.
Strago:    I have a special little Granddaughter!
Setzer:    My friend's airship... and her love!
Mog:       I have my friends here!
Kefka:     This is sickening... You sound like chapters from a self-help 
           booklet! Prepare yourselves!
Kefka:     Now, for my next trick, I will make you all... disappear!
Kefka, you don't know what you're doing! Stop!
Kefka:     I command the greatest power in the universe! You are all helpless 
           before me!
Kefka:     I will destroy everything... I will create a monument to 
           non-existence!
Life will go on! There will always be people, and dreams!
Kefka:     No! I will hunt them down. I will destroy it all! Destroy! Destroy! 
           Destroy!!
We will not allow you to harm another living thing.
Kefka:     Hee, hee, hee!! But what fun is destruction if no "precious" lives 
           are lost?
It's over, Kefka!

Kefka:     Life... dreams... hope... Where'd they come from? And where are 
           they headed? These things... I am going to destroy!
The end comes... beyond chaos.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
3. THE ENDING
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

It's breaking up! There's no time to lose! Airship's just ahead!
Celes:     Come on, everybody! We have to work together!
Celes:     Terra! What's wrong?
The Magicite... Magic is disappearing from this world...
Edgar:     The Espers... They no longer exist...
Celes:     You mean Terra, too?
Terra:     Come with me. I can lead you out with my last ounce of strength.

(roll character credits)



There is more of an ending, but I'm NOT going to spoil it =P
(I might add it soon... maybe...)
