VersionFinal| Jan. 2, 2005  | The final update that I am making to this FAQ.
+-----------+---------------+--------------------------------------------------

+-----------+---------------+--------------------------------------------------
|Version 2.0| March 19, 2004| I love you all, but to be honest, the FAQ is
+-----------+---------------| pretty much done. That means very few updates from
                            | here on. I decided to get rid of caravan encounters
                            | because I feel that the story is explained in the
                            | Story Analysis already (which has been completed,
                            | BTW). So maybe a few more updates to correct stuff,
                            | but that's basically it. No more diary entries, but
                            | I'm still accepting reader info (it just says
                            | complete because the main layout for it has been
                            | done).
                            +--------------------------------------------------

+-----------+---------------+--------------------------------------------------
|Version 1.6| March 13, 2004| As promised, the accessories and magicicite help
+-----------+---------------| chapters are done, and I've started recording
                            | diary entries. Also added a new chapter which
                            | will be completed when the caravan encounters are
                            | done. Wow! Hard to believe this FAQ is almost
                            | finished!
                            +--------------------------------------------------

+-----------+---------------+--------------------------------------------------
|Version 1.6| March 11, 2004| I didn't have that much homework today, meaning I
+-----------+---------------| was able to get in a big update. I finished the
                            | weapons, as well as the defensive items. The
                            | accessories and magicite info will be done
                            | tomorrow, and I'll start recording my diary. I
                            | need to tell you that I'll be away snowboarding
                            | Saturday through Friday, so you won't get any
                            | updates then, unfortunately. But I promise the FAQ
                            | will be completed soon.

+-----------+---------------| artifacts and began the weapons. Oh and one
                            | thing... OMG teh new chapter ADDED! Anyway, I'll
                            | try to update tomorrow, but I can't guarantee it.
                            | But I WILL have an update on Friday, okay?
                            +--------------------------------------------------

+-----------+---------------+--------------------------------------------------
|Version 1.3| March 08, 2004| Completed the scrolls (one of the hardest
+-----------+---------------| sections... glad it's doen), so I'll probably
                            | complete the entire item list and start on the
                            | artifacts next update.
                            +--------------------------------------------------

+-----------+---------------+--------------------------------------------------
|Version 1.2| March 07, 2004| Well, I finished the materials and started
+-----------+---------------| working on the scrolls. I'll hopefully be almost
                            | done with the scrolls by the end of tomorrow.
                            +--------------------------------------------------


+-----------+---------------+--------------------------------------------------
|Version 1.1| March 07, 2004| Enemies are done, game basics are done, and the
+-----------+---------------| item list has been started. More to come later
                            | today.
                            +--------------------------------------------------


+-----------+---------------+--------------------------------------------------
|Version 1.0| March 06, 2004| The Walkthrough is now complete! Yeah, a lot later
+-----------+---------------| than promised but it's still done! Enjoy!
                            +--------------------------------------------------


+-----------+---------------+--------------------------------------------------
|Version .9 | March 05, 2004| Yeah, I know, I'm a big liar. I only got some more
+-----------+---------------| enemies in, but I PROMISE you that the main FAQ
                            | will be completed by Sunday.
                            +--------------------------------------------------

+-----------+---------------+--------------------------------------------------
|Version .9 | Feb. 28, 2004 | I got a lot done today. The guides for Rebena Te
+-----------+---------------| Ra, Lynari Isle, Leuda, Lynari Desert, The Abyss,
                            | and Mag Mell are complete. Tomorrow, I'll finish
                            | Mount Vellenge, The Nest of Memories, and the
                            | Ending Description.
                            +--------------------------------------------------


+-----------+---------------+--------------------------------------------------
|Version .7 | Feb. 27, 2004 | Big apologies for the update gap. I've had one
+-----------+---------------| hell of a week and haven't had any time to get on
                            | my computer. I finished the guide for Kilanda
                            | Islands, Kilanda, Rebena Plains, and Conall
                            | Church. I'll finish year four tomorrow.
                            +--------------------------------------------------

+-----------+---------------+--------------------------------------------------
|Version .6 | Feb. 22, 2004 | I started working on the main guide again, and I
+-----------+---------------| completed years two AND three. So that means
                            | Mochet Manor, Tida, Veo Lu, Veo Lu Sluice, Shella,
                            | Jegon River, Plains of Fum, Fields of Fum,
                            | Daemon's Court, and Selepation Cave are done!
                            | This is probably my biggest update so far. Okay,
                            | to everyone's mass dissapointment, I'm going to
                            | stop working on the main guide until Friday, and
                            | work on enemies in the meantime. But the
                            | walkthrough will hopefully be complete in a full
                            | week, so don't get all upset!
                            +--------------------------------------------------

+-----------+---------------+--------------------------------------------------
|Version .2 | Feb. 19, 2004 | Yeah, hell of alotta enemies have been completed.
+-----------+---------------| Basically it, although I'm going to get more game
                            | basics and start on the main guide again tomorrow.
                            +--------------------------------------------------

+-----------+---------------+--------------------------------------------------
|Version .16| Feb. 18, 2004 | Okay, the guide for Vale of Alfitaria and
+-----------+---------------| Alfitaria are done. I have some more enemies in
                            | as well. For the next couple days, I'll be working
                            | on basically only enemies. More tomrrow (again).
                            +--------------------------------------------------

+-----------+---------------+--------------------------------------------------
|Version .15| Feb. 16, 2004 | Like I promised, I have more game basics complete,
+-----------+---------------| the controls in, The Goblin Wall walkthrough done,
                            | and I have 1 out of 102 enemies complete! Yeah!
                            | Expect even more tomorrow.
                            +--------------------------------------------------


+-----------+---------------+--------------------------------------------------
|Version .1 | Feb. 15, 2004 | I don't know if this will make you angry or happy,
+-----------+---------------| but I decided to save the controls, game basics,
                            | and enemy info for the next update, and add TWO
                            | more dungeons instead of one. The Mushroom Forest,
                            | Marr's Pass, and Mine of Cathuriges guides are
                            | totally complete. I promise that some enemy info,
                            | with what should be the rest of the game basics,
                            | and the controls will be added tomorrow, along with
                            | the walkthrough for The Goblin Wall.
                            +--------------------------------------------------

+-----------+---------------+--------------------------------------------------
|Version .01| Feb. 14, 2004 | Well, got a nice amount of the guide done. A lot
+-----------+---------------| of the game basics have been completed, along with
                            | the guide for Tipa, Port Tipa, and the River Belle
                            | Path. Expect more tomorrow.
                            +--------------------------------------------------


+-----------+---------------+--------------------------------------------------
|Version.001| Jan. 29, 2004 | Started the guide. No, pretty much NO information
+-----------+---------------| has been added, but the basic layout is done
                            | along with a few other basic things.
                            +--------------------------------------------------

It's been years since a Final Fantasy game has found its way onto a Nintendo
console. Now, Final Fantasy returns to where it started. Final Fantasy: Crystal
Chronicles is like no other Final Fantasy game you've ever played. Yes, it has that
intense game length and fifty bazillion side-quests, but it also has multiplayer and
pure live action battles. And no, this isn't some crap multiplayer like a Sonic
game; the multiplayer is probably the BEST thing this game has to offer (more on
that later). Well, now that we've got that settled, let me introduce myself. My name
is Colin Scully, know as "me frog" on GameFAQs. I have written seventeen FAQs so far
for GameFAQs, and this is my eigthteenth.

I wrote a FAQ for Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, which is the only other Final
Fantasy game I've covered. Hopefully, Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles shouldn't be
the last FF game I'll write a guide for. I'm basically a hardcore Nintendo fan, and
have written for only Nintendo games. This will probably stay that way for a while,
since I am currently not interested in picking up one of the other consoles (well,
if I had the money, I would...). Okay, the last FAQ I wrote had what was pretty much
a completely different format than my last few FAQs. I've decided to stick with that
format, so this FAQ should be readable enough. As for anyone who's played a Final
Fantasy game, you should know that they are typically huge.

So yeah, the size of this FAQ is going to start to slowly grow. I'll cover pretty
much everything, from the multiplayer walkthrough to the enemy lists to the items
and equipment. The FAQ will spawn over a period of a few months, since there's no
way I can complete this within a month or so. Also, expect 30+ updates to come your
way at rapid speed, basically one every one or two days. As the FAQ nears
completion, the updates will slow down, but until then I'm going to be very active
writing what is probably going to be the most fun FAQ I've written.

+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+

A powerful dark substance, the terrible Miasma, has covered all the world after a
terrible meteor struck. This misasma is fatal, causing instant death to anyone who
comes into contact with it. When all looked like their was nothing to be done, and
that the miasma could not be destroyed, everyone began to lose hope...

                    But then the Crystal was discovered...

This powerful crystal could keep away the miasma, protecting all types of races from
it's deadly posion. Large crystals were placed in the bigger towns, while smaller
crystals were placed in villages. However, this crystal needs the sacred substance,
the water Myrrh, to get its power.

               However, the water Myrrh did not have eternal power...

Only for a single year could the Myrrh protect the races from the miasma. That's
why, every year, the villages and towns send out young, adventurous villagers from
their home to seek the Myrrh trees, which held the Water of Life. These villagers
traveled in crystal caravans, and spent a year collecting drops of Myrrh from
different trees.

             If the villagers fall, their hometown will fall with them...

        This is the story of a group of villagers who are out to collect Myrrh...

+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+
|                                 The Races                                   |
+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+

There are four different races in Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles. At the
beginning of the game, you must choose the race that you want. This is important,
since each race has different strengths and weaknesses. There are four races:
Clavats, Lilties, Yukes, and Selkies.

~~~~~~~
Clavats
~~~~~~~
Clavats are my personal favorite, since they have well balanced stats. Although HP
and Strenth is moderate, Defense is pretty good (though not the best) and the Magic
stat is the biggest plus here.

+------------+
|Clavat stats|
|HP: 8       |
|Strength: 6 |
|Defense: 7  |
|Magic: 13   |
+------------+

~~~~~~~
Lilties
~~~~~~~
Lilties are also a strong group, mainly because they excel in HP, Strength, and
Defense. Magic is okay, but not great, and is the lowest of all the tribes. If you
like physical combat with a good mix of strength and defense, choose some Lilties to
go along with you.

+--------------+
|Lilties' stats|
|HP: 8         |
|Strength: 8   |
|Defense: 8    |
|Magic: 10     |
+--------------+

~~~~~
Yukes
~~~~~
Yukes excel in magic, and they are the best at casting it. It takes a short time to
charge up any kind of magic, and they have the most powerful magic too. However,
they have low strength and defense, the weakest of all races, so if you're not good
at dodging attacks or physical combat, you might want to wait until you're more
experienced.

+------------+
|Yukes' stats|
|HP: 8       |
|Strength: 5 |
|Defense: 5  |
|Magic: 15   |
+------------+

~~~~~~~
Selkies
~~~~~~~
Selkies are okay when it comes to stats, but when you look at their focus attack,
you will be happy; it has a much shorter waiting time to charge up than any other
races, which allows them to relelase powerful attacks quicker. If you rely on magic
or don't like to use focus attacks, then I suggest you don't choose a Selkies to
join you.

+--------------+
|Selkies' stats|
|HP: 8         |
|Strength: 7   |
|Defense: 6    |
|Magic: 12     |
+--------------+

+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+
|                                 The Years                                   |
+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+

Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles is split up into a period of eight years. Each
year, you'll have to travel to three different dungeons and complete them before
moving on to the next year. If you get a Myrrh drop from one dungeon, you must wait
at least two years before you can get Myrrh from that dungeon again. However, if you
want to enter a dungeon that doesn't have Myrrh in it, feel free. A cycle will pass,
but not a year. You can get artifacts that way, so always feel free to do so.

+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+
|                              The Action Menu                                |
+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+

The Action Menu is the reason that GBAs are required for multiplayer. You'll be
visiting it a lot, switching spells, checking out treasures, and using items. There
are nine options in the Action Menu, and each has a unique purpose.

~~~~~~~~~~~~
Command List
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Command List is possilby the most visited menu screen in the whole game. Here,
you can assign different options to your command menu. At first, you start off with
four slots, two of which contain Attack and Defend. You cannot remove Attack and
Defend, but you can place any item or spell you wish in the empty slots. If you
select an empty slot, you can assign healing items, like fruit/Phoenix Downs to it.
You can also assign magic to the slots, which is probably what you'll always be
assigning. Although four slots are only available at the beginning of the game, you
can get more as you progress through the different dungeons.

~~~~~
Items
~~~~~
You can use items in the game to do different features, like cure a status effect or
heal some HP. From the item list, you can scroll through the different items you
have. At the bottom of the screen is a description of what the item is. You can use,
drop, or destroy items here.

~~~~~
Equip
~~~~~
There are four slots in the Equip option. The first two slots are four your weapon
and your armor, but the last two slots can be filled in with any type of equipment
you'd like. Make sure to always choose the strongest things in your invetory to be
successful!

~~~~~~~~~
Artifacts
~~~~~~~~~
Here, you can view what Artifacts you have collected. An artifact only appears here
after you actually complete a dungeon and select one. You can view what an artifact
does to your character here, as well as the ones you're missing.

~~~~~~~~~
Treasures
~~~~~~~~~
Once you pick up an artifact in a dungeon, it'll be added to your treasures section.
The artifacts here only stay in as long as you're in a dungeon. Once you've cleared
a dungeon, the artifacts will vanish from this option and the one that you chose to
keep will be moved to your Artifacts section. Whatever an artifact does will affect
you while you're in a dungeon, but clearing the dungeon will make you lose the
artifact and the stat effect.

~~~~~
Money
~~~~~
I don't think money should have an individual option. It simply shows the amount of
gil that you have. You can drop gil on the ground here, which only makes sense if
you want to give some to other players.

~~~~~~~~~
Favorites
~~~~~~~~~
The favorites show the foods that you like and dislike. Eating food heals your HP,
and also gives you a stat boost for the dungeon. However, the amount of HP that you
heal and the stat boost you get depends on whether you like the food you're eating
or not. If you don't like the food, you will still heal HP, but may suffer not a
stat boost, but a stat loss, which brings down some of your stats. The more you eat
a type of food, the more you'll grow to like it. Eventually, you can end up liking
all types of fruit! Here's what each food item does to you:

Meat---
      ------raises strength by two
Fish---

Grand Portato----
                |
Star Carrot------raises defense by two
                |
Round Corn-------

Striped Apple-----
                  |
Rainbow Grapes-----raises magic by two
                  |
Cherry Cluster----

~~~~~~
Family
~~~~~~
Your family will send you letters each time you clear a dungeon. It'll always
contain a note and a nice item. In return, you'll want to send back items and a
thank you note in return. If you send items that have to do with your family's job,
it'll have a better effect on your relationship with your family. The better your
relationship is, the better discounts you'll get on different items. This option
shows your relationships with the other four members of your family. An angry face
is a terrible relationship, a sad face is bad, a plain face is okay, a smiling face
is good, and an extremely happy face is great.

~~~~~~~
Letters
~~~~~~~
Here, you can view all the letters that you have received from your family. You can
read all of them if you wish, and if you haven't taken the gift out from the letter,
you can do that too.

+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+
|                         Using the Game Boy Advance                          |
+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+

The Game Boy Advance is your command screen when you're playing in multiplayer. Why?
Well, once you start playing the game, you'll realize that you'll be using your
Command Screen a LOT. If two, three, or four people all had to do this, you'd never
leave the Action Menu. Therefore, you do all options on your GBA. There are also
special features that you can get if you're playing alone. When playing alone, you
can plug a GBA into a controller slot and depending on the color of your moogle,
different things will appear on it. You may get a map of the dungeon that you're in,
which basically shows the layout of the map. You can also get a monster locator,
which shows you where all the monsters are. Regular monsters are yellow X's and the
boss is a red X.

The chest locator shows you the location of all treasure chests, which appear in
differnet colored dots. Finally, the monster stat guide allows you to see a
monster's HP, strengths, weaknesses, and current item when you strike the monster.
If you have a GBA connected, you'll want the monster stat guide!

+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+
|                                Family Jobs                                  |
+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+

You cannot open all homes in your hometown unless you have a character on your
Memory Card that has a job that relates to the house. For example, if you choose
your job to be a Rancher, the Rancher house will be open. I suggest making eight
characters on your card with eight different jobs so all shops will open.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Family Production
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Family Production isn't a job; it's simply the relationship that you have with your
family. As I stated in the "Family" section of the Action Menu part of the guide,
the better relationship you have will prove to have positive results. Production
increases as you increase your relationship with your family.

~~~~~~
Miller
~~~~~~
Millers like collecting different seeds. Make sure to give your parents Wheat Seeds
constantly, and eventually you'll get some flour from your parents due to the wheat
you gave them.

~~~~~~~~
Merchant
~~~~~~~~
A merchant is one of the recommended parents, since you can buy different things
from your dad and sell stuff. At first, you are only able to buy a small amount of
items from your dad, but it grows later. The production in your family will depend
on the different items available. At first, you can only buy Alloy, Fish, Iron,
Meat, Milk, and Spring Water. Later, Mythril, Gold, Silver, Bronze Shards, and Iron
Shards will appear. Next, Magma Rocks, Chilly Gel, and Thunderballs will become
available, and finally you'll be able to buy Ultimites and Dark Spheres.

~~~~~~~~~
Fisherman
~~~~~~~~~
If your father is a fisherman, you'll get fish every year. The better your
relationship is with your family determines how much fish you'll get.

~~~~~~
Farmer
~~~~~~
The Wheat Seed is the main pick when sending letters to farmers. If you do so, your
father will give you some bread. After a couple of years pass, you'll start to get
some wheat from your family.

~~~~~~~~~~
Blacksmith
~~~~~~~~~~
The Blacksmith is also a useful fath, sinice he can construct weapons for you. If
you pay the proper amount of gil, you can use scrolls and materials collected from
dungeons to make more powerful weapons and armor. At first, he can only make the
Bronze Armor, Iron Armor, Bronze Gloves, Iron Gloves, Bronze Belt, Iron Belt, Iron
Shield, Warrior's Weapon, and Novice's Weapon. Later, he can construct the Master's
Weapon, Mythril Sallet, Mythril Gloves, Mythril Belt, and Mythril Shield. If you
have a good relationship, you can get a Legendary Weapon, Diamond Gloves, Diamond
Sallet, Diamond Armor, and a Diamond Belt. The best relationship will get you the
Greatest Weapon.

~~~~~~
Tailor
~~~~~~
A parent who is a tailor can make all kinds of additional equipment (not like
weapons and armor) for you. Again, the relationship determines what can be made. At
first, only the Clockwork, Flame Craft, Frost Craft, and Lightning Craft can be
constructed. Later, you can get New Clockwork, Tome of Wisdome, Fiend Kit, Tome of
Speed, and Goggle Techniques. If you have an even better relationship you can get
White Yarn, Gold Craft, Secrets of Wisdom, Angel Kit, and Designer Glasses. The
ultimate relationship will net you a Ring of Invincibility.

~~~~~~~~~
Alchemist
~~~~~~~~~
Alcehmists don't give you new items and equipemnt; they give you the scrolls to get
them. You can get a scroll per year, and the scroll you get depends on your
relationship. In order from worst to best, you can get Iron Armor, Warrior's Weapon,
Flame Armor, Clockwork, Mythril Armor, Frost Craft, Lightning Craft, Master's
Weapon, Ring of Light, Diamond Armor, Ring of Invincibility, or the Greatest Weapon.

~~~~~~~
Rancher
~~~~~~~
If your parents are Ranchers, you can get some meat during each year. Eventually,
you can get milk to. You can send cows from the other parts of the world to get the
milk.

|                               Status Effects                                |
+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+

Status effects are active in almost any RPG game you'll find. They can piss you off,
of course, but there are some good things that can happen to you also. There are
twelve status effects in the game, and I'll list them all here, in alphabetical
order.

~~~~
Burn
~~~~
If you're burned, you'll have your defense stat reduced and you'll start to slow
down a little. The only cure for this is to run around and wait for the fire to
calm, or to cast the magic Clear.

~~~~~
Curse
~~~~~
A serious status effect is Curse, which can half Strength, Defense, and Magic. This
will serously mess you up, because you'll be performing weak attacks while suffering
from major damage. The only good thing to do would be to cast Clear or just run
around, avoiding attacks, until the spell wears off.

~~~~~
Death
~~~~~
Death is the worst thing that can happen to you, basically because you die and can't
do anything. In multiplayer, having all characters die ends the game, while having
only the single character die in Single Player will give you a game over. In
multiplayer, other people can use Life, Full-Life, or a Phoenix Down on you, but
only if a Phoenix Down is on your command list can you automatically revive in
single player.

~~~~~~
Freeze
~~~~~~
Freeze is one of the most deadly status effects, because it makes your character
unable to move AND you suffer double damage when hit. The only way to escape your
frozen prison is by moving the control stick back and forth rapidly or casting the
spell Clear.

~~~~~
Haste
~~~~~
Haste is actually a very good status effect. This will cause your character to move
twice as fast and reduce magic and focus waiting times by half. It wears off after a
while.

~~~~~~~~~~
Knock Back
~~~~~~~~~~
Knock Back will make a character stop their attack and will send them back a little,
stunning them for a brief moment. Not the worst effect, but you'll still want to
avoid it.

~~~~~~~~~
Paralysis
~~~~~~~~~
If you're hit by Thunder, Thunara, or Thundaga, you'll be paralyzed. Paralysis is
like Freeze, although you won't suffer double damage when hit. Remember, you're
immobile, so you can't dodge attacks. Quickly move the control stick back and forth
to regain movement control agian.

~~~~~~~
Petrify
~~~~~~~
If you're petrified, you won't be able to move. Unlike Paralysis, however, you can't
wiggle the control stick back and forth to escape. Instead, you must either cast
Clear or simply wait until you are able to move again.

~~~~~~
Poison
~~~~~~
Poison. If a game has status effects in it, you can guarantee that one of those
effects will be poison. This will cause you to lose half of a heart every five
seconds, and you'll have to wait thirty seconds before it wears off (so it'll take
away three hearts). The only way to get rid of poison faster is to quickly cast
Clear.

~~~~
Slow
~~~~
Slow is an annoying status effect that makes your character's speed reduce by half.
Also, the time it takes for you to charge up magic and Focus Attacks are doubled.
You simply need to run around until the spell wears off or cast Clear.

~~~~~~
Stasis
~~~~~~
Stasis is pretty much the exact same as Petrify, since you can't move and you won['t
be able to wiggle the control stick to escape. If you don't have Clear, you simply
need to wait until Stasis wears off.

~~~~
Stun
~~~~
Stun is like a very brief version of paralysis, since you'll sometimes be hit by
certain attacks and be unable to move for a second or two. Nothing that big to worry
about, but it can still hurt you.

+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+

Moogle Nests are little homes where two (sometimes three) moogles rest. One of the
moogles let's you paint him or give him a haircut, which can effect your moogle in
single-player mode. The other moogle gives you a Mog Stamp. A Mog Stamp (there are
23 Mog Stamps total), is a little stamp that is painted onto your Stamp Card (which)
you'll get when you get your first Mog Stamp). Each stamp is part of a set. When you
collect all stamps in a certain set, a Game Boy Advance multiplayer mini-game called
Blazin' Caravans will be unlocked. It's a race between all different caravans, and
you can collect fruits as you go through. This is your stamp card:

Now, the moogle that you can paint and trim can help you a lot. The color of your
moogle determines what GBA screen will show and what spells your moogle is most
likely to cast (remember, he occasionally casts spells). Here's the chart of what
GBA radar and magic your moogle will cast if you paint your moogle.

----------------------------------
Color | GBA screen  | Magic cast |
----------------------------------
White | Dungeon map |Random magic|
----------------------------------
Red   |Monster radar| Fire       |
----------------------------------
Blue  | Chest radar | Blizzard   |
----------------------------------
Green | Enemy info  | Thunder    |
----------------------------------

Your moogle always carries the crystal chalice when you're on adventures. However,
Mog gets tired sometimes, and he'll ask you to carry it for a short time. If you
don't carry it, Mog will move twice as slow and you'll have to move a lot slower
or walk into the miasma. Simply pick the chalice up and walk in circles for a few
seconds, and Mog will tell you that he's ready to carry the chalice. However,
depending on how hot or cold a dungeon is, Mog will get tired quicker. If you trim
his hair or leave it long, Mog will have more energy. Cutting his hair when you're
going to KILANDA or LYNARI DESERT will make Mog carry the chalice longer, since all
his hair isn't making him too hot. Keeping his hair long when you're in TIDA, CONALL
CHURCH, REBENA TERA, MOUNT VELLENGE, SELEPATION CAVE, and VEO LU SLUICE will make
Mog carry the chalice longer, since his long hair is keeping him warm.

|                              Cycle Changes                                  |
+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+

After you beat a boss in a dungeon once and collect a drop of Myrrh, Myrrh won't
return to the tree until you wait two years. Once two years have passed, Myrrh will
return. This is called a cycle change. Many different things are changed during a
cycle. There are new enemies, enemies have more HP, bosses have new moves, the
artifacts, scrolls, and materials are different, and the artifact sets dropped by
the boss changes. On rare occasions, paths will be opened and closed, allowing you
access to new areas or preventing you from reaching older ones. There are a total of
three cycles per dungeon, except in the final dungeon where there's only once cycle.

+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+
|                               Bonus Points                                  |
+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+

After you beat a boss, you might notice that a bunch of points are added up. These
are your bonus points, and they determine what artifact set the boss will drop.
There are fifteen bonuses, and the amount of points you get per bonus depends on
what dungeon you're in. A bonus for you is picked at random at the start of the
dungeon, and only completing the requirements for that bonus will add to your point
total. The only way to see what bonus has been chosen for you is by hooking a GBA up
to the second port in your Gamecube. There is no way to see the current amount of
points that you have.

Here are the bonuses:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pick Up Items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All Magicite, Scrolls, Materials, Artifacts, and Food count as items. Gil does not
count as an item. If you drop an item and pick it up agian, you won't earn points
for that.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pick Up Money
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For any amount of money that you pick up, you'll earn points. You can pick up 1 gil,
you can pick up 10000 gil, the points earned will still be the same. If you drop gil
and pick it up again, you won't earn any points.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Defeat Enemies With Spell Fusion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I hate this one. You must KILL an enemy using a level two or three spell (Fira,
Blizzara, Thundara, Firaga, Blizzaga, or Thundaga). If you damage the enemy, you
don't get points; you must kill it.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Defeat Enemies With Focus Attacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I hate this one too. You must KILL an enemy use a focus attack. You don't get points
for damaging an enemy with a focus attack; only killing it.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Defeat Enemies With Spells
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you kill an enemy with any type of magic spell (Fire, Blizzard, Thunder, Fira,
Blizzara, Thundara, Firaga, Blizzaga, or Thundaga) you'll get points. You don't get
points for damaging an enemy with a spell; only killing it.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Open Treasure Chests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Any timie you open a treasure chest in a level (Mimics included), you'll gain some
bonus points.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Inflict Damage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Best. Bonus. Ever. You'll get a single point every time you damage an enemy by means
of magic or weapons. If you switch to a very weak weapon, you can get tons of
points.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Take Physical Damage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you're whacked by an enemy's weapon, then you'll earn bonus points. If you keep
letting an enemy hurt you, and you use Cure when needed, you can get lots of points.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Take Magical Damage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If an enemy casts a spell on you (It has to be part of the Fire, Blizzard, or
Thunder set; Slow, Stop, and Haste don't give you points), then you'll get points.
You can get lots of points if you find a mage and let it attack you a lot, healing
when needed.

~~~~~~~~~~~~
Avoid Damage
~~~~~~~~~~~~
You start with a certain amount of points. Each time you are hit by an enemy (weapon
or magic), you'll lose points. Simply rush past all enemies you see if you want a
high score.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Don't Cast Spells
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You start with a certain amount of points. Each time you cast a spell, you'll lose
points. If another person casts a spell on you, points aren't taken off, however.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Don't Use Focus Attacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You start with a certain amount of points. Each time you use a focus attack (whether
it damages or kills the enemy), you'll lose points.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Don't Use Physical Attacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You start with a certain amount of points. Each time you use a physical attack
(whether it damages or kills the enemy), you'll lose points. Stick to level three
magic when this bonus is active.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Don't Heal Yourself
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You start with a certain amount of points. Each time you cast Cure on yourself or
use a healing item, you'll lose points. If you are cured by another person, you
won't lose any points for that.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Don't Pick Anything Up
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You start with a certain amount of points. Each time you pick up any type of item or
gil, you'll lose points. If a friend drops GIL for you, you can pick it up without
losing points. You'll lose points if you pick up a friend's dropped item, however.

Here's how I'll list the points:

D1= River Belle Path
D2= Mushroom Forest
D3= Mine of Cahturiges
D4= Goblin Wall
D5= Tida
D6= Moschet Manor
D7= Veo Lu Sluice
D8= Daemon's Court
D9= Selepation Cave
D10= Kilanda
D11= Conall Church
D12= Rebena Te Ra
D13= Lynari Desert

Well, here it is. The walkthrough. Okay, there are a couple of things that I'll be
explaining here. First, I always list the enemies found before anything else. Then
I'll put down the Scrolls, Materials, and Artifacts that you'll find while in the
dungeon. Also, I'll put the scoring system which judges what artifact set you'll get
at the end of a level.

For the Enemies part, I'll list the enemies in alphabetical order and tell you what
cycles they are found in. For the Scrolls, Materials, and Artifacts part I'll list
all S, M, and A found and then if they are found in a certain cycle I'll say "Yes"
in that cycle's box. If they aren't found in that cycle, I'll put "No" in the cycle
box. For the scoring system, I'll divide it into eight different sets, and list the
point requirements depending on how many players you have, and then the artifact set
given when you meet the point requirements.

Okay, that was simple, wasn't it? Now let's start the guide!

                                     ~~~

After watching the opening, you'll have to name your town. I'd stick with Tipa,
since that's how I'll be referring to it for the rest of the guide. After you read
your diary, you can select "Set Out" which allows you to start your adventure.
Choose the options you want to create your character, and then press B once you
return to the character select/create screen. You'll begin your adventure!

+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+
|                                   Tipa                            Y101      |
+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+

First, talk to your family members and you'll appear back at the map. Just select
Tipa again to head back. First, let me describe the areas of Tipa. You have to run
forward for a bit before you enter the actual town. Head left and you'll find the
MILLER below you and the MERCHANT right above you. Head left some more and then
south to find the FISHERMAN'S HUT. Going back to the main path, you'll find a split.
To your left is the FARMER'S HOUSE. Head back to the split and take the other path.
You'll be right in front of the TAILOR'S HOUSE. We're going to take a break from our
tour at the moment and head left. Follow this long path until you reach a boulder on
your right. Walk around it until the "examine" icon appears.

Press A and you'll obtain one of the game's hidden items. Very nice. Okay, head back
to the Tailor's house and go east. Here, the town's main crystal rests. You can talk
to the people here, but south of the crystal is the BLACKSMITH'S AREA. Head back to
the crystal and go around to the back of it. Walk all the way up to the back of the
crystal and the "examine" icon should pop up. Step into the small door and talk to
the moogle there. You can paint him if you like, but locate the moogle with the
flowers since he's important. Since you probably don't know what a mog stamp is, ask
"What's a Mog Stamp?" and you'll get your STAMP CARD and your first MOG STAMP.
You're done here, so head back outside.

All right, we had a little stop on the tour to grab the Mog Stamp, but we're back on
track now. Head right once you're outside and you'll find the home of the ALCHEMIST.
Finally, head south down the path to find the last house, the RANCHER'S HOUSE.
You're back at the beginning of Tipa, which is all cool. Okay, let me explain to you
one thing. On this tour, you probably noticed that seven moogles were blocking
houses telling you that no one was home. If they did, then that means that you have
not created a character of that job. I recommend that you create eight characters,
all with different jobs. When you do, you'll have access to all the areas here,
making your adventure easier. For now, head back out to the World Map.

Head forward to enter Port Tipa.

+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+
|                                 Port Tipa                         Y102      |
+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+

As you head out of Tipa, you'll be stopped by a fellow caravan. They'll talk to you
for a while and then give you a Moogle. When you're back on the World Map, head up,
and then left to enter the actual Port Tipa. When you start, turn around and head
down the paths. You'll find a hole in plain view. Enter it to be inside a Moogle's
Nest. Collect your second Mog Stamp and head back out. Continue down south to the
beach. Here, you'll find your moogle friend. He'll teach you all of the different
things that you need to know. When you're done learning, head back to the World Map
and return to the area where you encounter your first caravan. Head right here to
enter River Belle Path.

Introduction to: River Belle Path
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You did realize that this dungeon was going to be extremely easy, right? Of course!
Seriously, this dungeon can be beaten in a freakin ten minutes, maybe fifteen or
twenty if you're on the second or third cycle. But it's a great place to go if you
want to train a little bit, get some artifacts, upgrade your stats, or get some
money. Don't expect all dungeons to be like this though; this is really a nice
little gift Square-Enix gave to you (seriously, this thing is freaking SIMPLE!)

Main guide
~~~~~~~~~~

Listening to the narraration, you'll learn that everyone who crossed here was always
eaten, because of the monsters. However, the people found a safer route, and now
take that. However, crystal caravans always go through the River Belle Path, because
a Myrrh Tree rests here. When you start, head north and then west. Here, place the
crystal chalice on one of the heavy wooden switches and have your character stand on
the other one. This will lower a bridge, but you can't cross it yet, since you still
need to lower the other half (which we'll do later). This bridge is a very handy
shortcut that saves you from going all the way around the Belle Path. Head back and
follow the other path, fighting the goblins as you go.

When you reach the gate blocking your path, take out the goblins and pick up the
strange circular item. Place this in the little hole to the left of the gate to open
the path for you. Go through the gate and then head south, after grabbing the chest
to your right. Keep going south, defeating the enemies as you go. When you get to
the very end of the area, you'll find the other two switchs where you can place the
chailce on one and step on the other. This lowers the second part of the bridge
creating the handy shortcut. Now go back north, but don't take the path back to the
area you were before; instead, take the path to your right, and follow it to the
end. Defeat the enemies and open the chest.

Now head along the north wall and at the far right, you should see a round stone.
Examine it to reveal a hole, and enter to find the Moogle's Nest. Collect your stamp
and paint your moogle if you wish, then head back outside. From here, backtrack all
the way to the area just past the first gate. Here, head forward to find another
closed gate. Defeat all the goblins here and you'll reveal the key, but don't get it
just yet. Head right and you'll eventually find a treasure chest. Open it for a
scroll. Now head back to the key and place it in the proper slot to open the gate.
Defeat the Mu that pops up here as you head forward. There are two paths you can
take, so choose either one and head north, defeating the enemies.

At the end of each path is a chest with a nice item. Now head back to the split and
go south. Look to the left of you and you'll notice a broken bridge. You can cross
this, so do and then grab the item from the chest. Now head south, down the stone
path, and follow the path until a Mu appears. Defeat it to grab a key, and then head
south and use the key to open the gate. This doesn't lead to anywhere new, but it's
a shortcut which can help you if you need to escape quickly. Now head north and
defat all the the enemies here. Continue to go north and you should spot a chest off
to the left side on a stray path. Head back to the main path and go forward. Cross
the bridge and you'll spot a blue sign.

It tells you that there is a moogle house to the right and extreme danger is to the
left. The moogles at the house can't give you any information or items, so prepare
yourself for tough combat and then head left to fight your first boss!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BOSS: Giant Crab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Giant Crab is your first boss, and you've hopefully gotten used to the controls
by now. If not, you'll have a tough time. You need to assign a Pheonix Down to you
command list so that you'll instantly revive if you fall. Also recommended is any
type of Holy magic, or Fire magic. Blizzard and Gravity work well too, but not as
much. Thunder, Slow, and Stop aren't effective at all, so makme sure you don't have
any of those in your command list. Make sure you have Cure in there, since it's very
useful. Okay, the evil Giant Crab has a few good attacks. The first attack is
Thunder, and it'll be using that for the majority of the battle. It'll back away and
charge up some magic, then shoot it forward. When you see it charge, move to the
side or back to avoid the attack.

It also likes to constantly spit out bubbles. These bubbles do no damage, but they
do cast Slow on you, which reduces your speed by half. You don't want that at all
during this battle, but the bubbles move very slow themselves, and vanish after a
short time; you shouldn't have a problem with them. Also, if you get in front of the
crab, it'll shoot a firey blast at you, causing you to lose health and bestow
temporary paralysis. Sometimes it'll jump high in the air and land crashing down in
another part of the arena. To avoid this, just make sure that you never stay in one
place (so just keep moving around). Occasionally, a Mu will pop out of the ground
and try to attack you. Wait until the crab charges Thunder, and then attack the Mu.

Otherwise, the crab will attack you while you're dealing with the Mu, and you don't
want to lose any more health. The last attack the crab has is a simple claw swipe,
which is easy to avoid and should never touch you. It's recommended that you combine
some spells to defeat the crab. Fira and Blizzara work best. Your main weapon does
pratically no damage to the crab, although a few hits may bring its health down. You
want to attack with your powerful magic from the side or the back. The best moment
to strike is when the crab starts to charge Thunder; run to the side and quickly
charge and attack with your magic. Also, if you have only a heart or less left, cast
Cure on yourself when the crab starts to charge Thunder.

Another opportunity to attack would be right after the crab sends the fire at you.
It hesitates for a short amount of time, enough for you to quickly cast some magic.
When you get the Giant Crab down to about 1/3 of its HP, the claws will fall off.
It'll now switch out Thunder with Thundara. Thundara has a wider radius, and it does
more damage and can paralyze you for a longer period of time. Avoid it at all costs,
and simply repeat your attack pattern otherwise until this crab falls.

--------------------
CYCLES TWO AND THREE
--------------------
Nothing changes during the second cycle, except the crab may be a little bit
stronger. However, during the third cycle, you're in for a wonderful treat; the
Giant Crab will stop using Thunder and Thundara and use Thundaga instead. Thundaga
has A LOT harder to avoid, since it covers almost the whole arena. This also does
heavy damage, and causes SERIOUS paralysis. Run like hell as fara away from the crab
as you can when you see the crab start to charge Thundaga. When you go to fight the
boss for the third cycle, make sure that you have some resistance to thunder attacks
for better luck.
*********************************************************************************

When you finally beat this tough crab, you'll walk up to the Myrrh Tree, which
sparkles with beauty. You'll collect your first drop of Myrrh from the tree, and
you're now 1/3 of the way there to gettting enough Myrrh to save your town for
another year. You'll get some mail from your father, and you should send the hidden
item you got at the beginning of the game to him. You'll now get to choose your
artifact.

+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+

Once you've grabbed your artifact, you'll return to the World Map. Head back to
Tipa. Okay, it's HIGHLY recommended that you have eight characters on your memory
card, one with a different job. If eight characters have different jobs, then every
shop will be open in Tipa and your journey will become a LOT easier. So go ahead and
make an additional seven characters (even if you aren't going to use them) with
different jobs. For the rest of the FAQ, I'm going to be assuming that all houses in
Tipa are open because you have all eight jobs available. Okay, in Tipa, first head
to the Merchant. Check if there's anything you want to buy, and then go to the
Blacksmith and see if you can forge some better equipment. When you've done that,
you'll be pretty much done here.

There's nothing else to really do at the moment, so simply leave.

Once you're on the World Map, head back to the River Belle Path, but DON'T enter it.
Instead, change your chalice element to water. Now go all the way north on the map
to enter the Miasma Stream. Here, talk to your moogle and he'll tell you a little
about the streams. For now, pick up your chailce and cross the area here (ignoring
all the strange stuff that happens), until you get across and enter the Iron Mine
Downs. Before you head to the next dungeon, check to see if you have the Novice
Sword. If not, then I recommend that you go and buy some iron from the merchant at
Tipa and then use the Blacksmith to create the Novice Sword (the required items are
Iron and the Novice Scroll). If you don't have enough gil to get the iron, take a
few trips through the River Belle Path to get some more gil or you can sell things
that you don't need.

Once you have the Novice Sword, head north then west to enter the Mushroom Forest.

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
While this dungeon is a step up in difficulty terms from the River Belle Path, it
shouldn't be too difficult if you've been through the River Belle Path a couple of
times. In the Mushroom Forest, you can get onto small mushrooms which will bounce
you up to new areas. There are a few in here, so get used to them. There are also a
lot more enemies, as well as airborne ones, so you're going to have to learn to use
your magic and Focus Attacks well. The boss, a big Malboro, is also a lot tougher
than the Giant Crab, so be ready.

Main guide for: Mushroom Forest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The narration tells you pretty much nothing about the forest, but it does say that
everyone sprouts from the Mushroom Forest. Yeah, whatever. Anyway, ready your
command list and then start the level. When you start, head west and defeat the
enemies, then open the chest for some gil. Note that if you're on your second or
third cycle, new mushrooms will grow next to the treasure chest. You can use these
to cross over to another path. Follow this path, defeating the enemies, and grab the
items from the three chests at the end. Anyway, from the chest with gil, continue
heading west, following the path. Take either path when you reach the junction and
defeat the enemies once the junctions merges again. Here, defeat the enemies then
run onto the mushroom.

Wait until your moogle or until all players are on the mushroom, and you'll leap to
the next area. Here, you'll find an Ahriman, which flys in the air and casts spells
from above. Combine two spells such as Thunder and Blizzard, Fire and Blizzard, etc.
to form the spell Gravity. If you cast this below the Ahriman, it'll heavily damage
it and bring it to the ground, allowing you to attack. Keep that in mind for the
rest of the level and for future dungeons. Anyway, open the chest and head east,
taking either path when you come to the junction. In this next area, check south if
you're at cycle three; if you are, a mushroom will be there and allow you to reach a
new area with a treasure chest. Anyway, from the open area, defeat the Ahriman and
open the chest.

Continue east up the path, defeating the enemies and openthing the chest. Now head
west, and defeat all the enemies. Look for a mushroom above you that you can jump
on. Open the chest here and look to your right. You can examine this mushroom to
reveal a hole. Enter the hole and you'll be in the Mog's Nest. Collect your stamp
and head back outside. Go back onto the main path and follow it east. Defeat all the
enemies and when you see two Hell Plants guarding a narrow path, you'll know you're
near the boss. Make any preparations (try to get fire magic and holy magic) you
need, and then head forward.

BOSS: Malboro
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Malboro... a traditional Final Fantasy enemy is now a freaky boss. Malboro is so
huge, that it is unable to move. However, you cannot get behind it or to the side of
it either, since it takes up a large part of the arena. The first thing you'll want
to do is take out the two Hell Plant's that are in the arena. They can cause small
problems for you if you let them live. Malboro has five different attacks, and
they're all very irritating. The first attack is the most common one; Malboro will
cause a bunch of vines to pop out of the ground. If you keep moving, then you'll be
able to avoid the vines without any problems. Malboro also likes to charge up a
black cloud and send it in an area. Simply avoid the target while it's being
charged.

Next, Malboro likes to suck you up. This is actually not a bad thing at all, unless
your crystal chalice is on the ground. If it is, the crystal chalice will be sucked
toward Malboro and you'll be out in the miasma. When Malboro trys to suck you up,
just run forward with him and start slashing. Malboro also likes to exhale green
gas. This gas isn't poisonous, but it CAN do some damage to you. The final attack is
the rarest one, but it can be very annoying. Malboro will charge up Slowga, which is
the most powerful of the Slow magic. It has a large radius, and touching it will
bestow Slow upon your character. If you are hit by the magic, run to the back of the
arena and run around until Slow wears off. If you, at any time, are at one heart or
less, then run to the very back of the arena and use Cure on yourself.

That's the safest place to be, since you're far away from the Malboro. Now, the Fire
magic and Holy magic is good to fight the Malboro with, since he has little
resistance against those two. Using Gravity, Blizzard, and Thunder will cause a
little damage, but not much. If you use Slow and Stop, pretty much nothing will
happen to Malboro. The best thing you can have is the Novice's Sword and the spell
Fire. You did get the Novice's Sword like I told you to, right? If so, then put your
Copper Sword in as your main weapon, and then assign the Novice's Sword to one of
the extra command slots. Next to it, assign Fire and they'll fuse and make
Flametongue, which causes major damage to Malboro. You'll basically want to stand in
front of Malboro and use rapid focus attacks and you'll win in no time.

--------------------
CYCLES TWO AND THREE
--------------------
Malboro will begin to cast Blizzaga, the most powerful of the Blizzard magic set,
when you enter the third cycle. This has a very large radius, and if you touch it
you'll lose health and instantly be frozen. It's recommended that you have the spell
Clear and some items that resist ice before you enter the battle, or you'll be out
quick.
*********************************************************************************

After you get a letter from your mother, reply saying that you need more love. When
you get to choose your artifact, go straight to the Earth Pendant; it'll give you an
additional heart, which is always good. Now go back to the World Map and head north
to enter Marr's Pass. Great, 2/3 of the way into your first year!

|                                Marr's Pass                        Y105      |
+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+

Here's your next town in the game. Marr's Pass isn't quite as big as Tipa, but I
find it more enjoyable. First, let's take the tour. Head north and you should see a
well. Examine it to get a SECRET ITEM. Now head to the center of the town and head
east. The MERCHANT should be right below you. It sells items that aren't sold at
Tipa, so you might want to check it out. If you continue going east you'll find the
WEAPONS BLACKSMITH. This guy can only forge weapons. Head all the way west, past the
crystal, and you'll find the ARMOR BLACKSMITH. You might want to try getting an Iron
Shield and a Warrior's Weapon here, if you have the gil and materials. Anyway,
that's the tour. Now let's get the Mog Stamp. From the Armor Blacksmith, go south
near the birdhouse to find some stairs.

Climb down and examine the small hole to enter the Moogle's Nest. Collect your Mog
Stamp (this time, you'll find the moogle sleeping upstairs) and then head back up.
There's nothing really to do here anymore, so head back out once you're ready.

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Mine of Cathuriges is another step up in difficulty. If you haven't mastered the
controls by now, or you haven't revisited River Belle Path and Mushroom Forest a
couple of times, then you won't be ready to enter the Mine of Cahturiges. It's a
longer dungeon, with a darker setting so it can be hard to see. This also involves
you pushing around a mine cart for the whole first part. Yes, there are two
different parts to this level; one takes place on the ground floor, and the other
takes place on a track that's above some miasma. The boss, the Orc King, is pretty
simple, though I suggest you have good strength and defense before facing him.

Main guide for: The Mine of Cathuriges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the world map, head east, north, then east to enter the Mine of Cathuriges.
Listening to the narraration, you'll find that the Lilties used the mine to make
powerful weapons, but the mine later failed and the Lilties abandoned the mine, and
monsters took over. When you start, strike the mine cart with your sword. Now head
north and west, defeating the enemies as you go. In the big open room, kill the
Bomb. Beware, when you defeat the bomb, a big explosion will occur, so stay far away
until it explodes. There's nothing here in the first cycle, but on the second and
third cycles, head up the stairs here to find some treasure chests. Now go back to
the mine track and follow it until you encounter the mine cart again. Strike it once
more and you'll bust through a wall.

Now continue forward and defeat the enemies, then step on the north switch. Place
the crystal chalice on the switch and then head over to the mine cart and strike it
a third time to break another wall. Before you go any further, head east and grab
the gil from the chest. Now head north, striking the mine cart as you go along. When
you reach a wide room, defeat the enemies and grab the item from the chest on your
right. Now push the mine cart until it stops at the two switches. Step on the
northern one again and then strike the cart to break another wall. Head through to
enter another area. You'll find that you mine cart is now gone, but don't worry, we
don't need it now. Follow the track north and east, and continue heading east even
after the track turns north again.

Defeat the enemy and open the chest to grab a nice item. Now go all the way west,
and search the area for treasure chests. Defeat the enemies as well, and then go
north. Defeat the Orge here and that'll reveal a key. Pick up this key and place it
in the slot next to the gate (like you did in River Belle Path). Now go through the
door to enter another area. You're high up here. Head north, down the mine track,
defeating the enemies. When the area opens up, defeat the Orcs and then go all the
way east to find a treasure chest. Continuing east only leads you to a dead end, so
don't bother. Now go back west and head north some more. Defeat the enemies as you
follow the track until you come to another open room. Defeat the two Orcs here and
head west. Open the treasure chest, then follow the track west. You'll come to a
dead end, but you can examine it.

It'll ask if you want to go inside, and you do. Inside is the Moogle's Nest, so
collect your stamp and head back out. Go to the big room you were just in and go
north from there. You'll now have to follow a twisting track, with few enemies. When
you enter the final big room, defeat the Orcs and open the chest, then ready
yourself for the boss battle. First, check if your crystal chalice is fire. If not,
go back to a fire fountain and change it. Otherwise, you will not be able to enter
the Iron Mine Downs in your second year until you complete a few dungeons. When your
crystal chalice is fire, heal, and have a powerful spell ready, then enter the boss
arena.

BOSS: Orc King
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Orc King is a pretty simple boss if you have the right equipment. That equipment
is basically the Warrior's Weapon and the Iron Shield, which you hopefully got at
Marr's Pass. Any spell will work too, but I find it best to be using physical
attacks on this guy. The Orc King has a few good attacks that do moderate damage,
but no powerful attacks that can wipe your HP out. I'd say that the most he can take
away is about half a heart at a time, maybe a little more. The Orc King's first
attack is the one used the most. The Orc King will charge Fiara and use it. Take
this opportunity to rush in and attack with a focus attack or a combo. If you stay
in too close to the Orc King, he'll do a powerful spin attack with his hammer. This
causes some damage and knocks you back, but it also makes the Orc King dizzy.

When he is dizzy, rush in, do a few quick attacks (or you can charge up and use some
magic), and then retreat. If you're too close, he'll also smash his hammer to the
ground, which can cause a reasonable amount of damage. Also note that Orcs will
occasionally come out of the mine doors. Only one appears each time, and you'll only
see about four or five in a battle, so you don't really have to worry about them.
Still, I suggest you take them out quickly so they don't cause a distraction. The
attacks that I've listed are basically the only attacks that the Orc King uses. So
if you have powerful magic (I really don't think that a level one spell is powerful;
try to do a level two spell if you have it), cast it. Otherwise, rush in and slash
away with your sword, using Focus Attacks whenever the Orc King becomes dizzy from
spinning.

When the Orc King is down to 25% of his HP, he'll glow yellow. Immidiately run
forward up to the Orc King and start slashing and using combos. Don't use Focus
Attacks, since you can't afford the time it takes to charge up. Just keep slashing
away until the Orc King dies. If you do not beat the Orc King in the time that he is
glowing yellow, he'll explode and cause heavy damage. If you know that you won't be
able to kill the Orc King before he explodes, run to the far corner of the arena and
cast Cure on yourself so that you're at full health. If you're in the corner, you'll
avoid suffering damage.

--------------------
CYCLES TWO AND THREE
--------------------
Unlike the Giant Crab and the Malboro, the Orc King does not get any new moves.
Instead, he and the regular Orcs have Haste cast upon them for the whole battle.
This means that they are a lot faster, and their attacks are also more powerful. I
suggest you don't use physical attacks here, and stay at a distance while using
powerful magic (Holy is recommended). When the Orc King glows yellow for the final
attack, make sure you're at full health and run to the corner; you won't be able to
defeat him fast enough, so it's best that you simply try to avoid suffering massive
damage.
*********************************************************************************

You'll get the final drop of Myrrh for the first year. Great! You're 1/5 of the way
to the end of the game! You'll get your mail, and it's a different letter depending
on how you responded to the last one. You should've said, "I need more love."
Respond here with "I'll survive." Choose your artifact here and then you'll be at
the crystal ceremony in Tipa. Everybody will be running around and your diary
entries will appear. Read them all and watch as the old man sprinkles the Myrrh into
the crystal. Your hometown is now safe from miasma for another year. Read the rest
of your diary entries or press START to skip them (I always like to look them over).

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
While not necesserily a big dungeon, the Goblin Wall still may be challenging. There
are dark areas, and it may be hard to find your way. There are also many connecting
passageways that you may get lost in, but it isn't that difficult to get back on the
main track. The enemies are basically all goblins, along with some jellyfish and
flans, but they shouldn't cause any problems at all.

Main guide for: The Goblin Wall
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Start to head toward the Miasma Stream, but take a right when you are far north.
You'll be at the Goblin Wall. The narraration says that Lilties destroyed many
monsters long ago, but monsters still lurk in different places, such as the Goblin
Wall. Basically, you're going to encounter goblins. Just goblins. Wonderful, right?
Prepare the command list and then start. There's a goblin and a flan waiting for
you, so take them out and then head left. Climb up the small hill and when you get
to the top, you should see two strange looking switches. Strike them with your
weapon to open the cages below. Go down to each cage and grab the item in the
treasure chest, then head back up to the top of the hill. Go to the far right and
then head up the next hill.

Defeat the goblins and flans here, then strike all skull switches to open the gates
below you. Remember, there's a third switch where you have to go up a small hill to
reach. Once you strike that third switch, use the small hill to go up to a higher
ledge with a bat, an open chest, and a switch. Strike the switch and collect the
item on the floor below, then return to the floor below that one. Head all the way
left and enter the cage here. Press B to examine and you'll enter a Moogle's Nest.
Get your stamp and then head back oustide. Once you're outside again, head back up
to the next floor and go left all the way. Defeat the enemies and strike the switch
to open a gate revealing the entrance to another area.

Head down to the lower floor and go through that gate to enter the second area. Go
straight here and defeat the enemies, then head up the hill. If you are on cycles
two or three, go north and east, then you'll find a path that previously had rocks
has been opened. If you follow the path, hitting the switch, you'll find a treasure
chest. When you have the chest, head back to the area that you were before, and go
west, striking all four skeleton switches (don't forget to strike the fifth skeleton
switch that's east of the hill you climbed!) Now head back down to the previous
floor and collect the item in the chest east of you. Now go west, getting the item
from the chest, and heading through the tunnel. Defeat the jellyfish here and grab
the item from the chest.

Strike the two skeleton switches here and then go down the hill that's located all
the way west. Climb down, defeat the enemies, go through the small cave, and defeat
some more enemies. Sorry, there's nothing of interest here, we just came for the
enemies so that you could get the items. Now backtrack to the previous floor (the
upper one), and head straight, climbing another hill. Head east, striking all
skeleton switches, and continuing past the gate and striking the rest of the
switches. There's also a treasure chest at the end. Now head back to the lower
floor, go all the way east (through the small tunnel again), and go back up the hill
here. Collect all the goodies, then return to the gate you saw earlier. Grab the key
and place it in the slot to open the door.

This is the entrance to the boss, so ready yourself by combining powerful spells and
healing, then enter.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BOSS: Goblin King
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When you start, you won't be fighting the boss directly. Instead, you must fight
four regular goblins, which will release two keys. Pick up these keys and place them
in the correct slots to open the door and begin the real battle. The Goblin King is
tougher than the past three bosses; the only thing he is easily damaged by is Holy;
Fire, Blizzard, and Thunder do moderate damage, and Slow and Stop do almost no
damage at all. I suggest to stick to powerful focus attacks and Holy if you have it.
If you can, combine some of these spells to get the level two or three spells.
Although the Goblin King has some tougher attacks, there is one very nice thing: he
has a very limited amount of HP. Yes, it is a small amount, but he makes up for that
by having some powerful attackskk that can take away at least half a heart each.

The Goblin King has four attacks. The first one is a simple attack that only happens
if you're too close to him; he'll simply swing his staff and knock you away. He also
likes to cast Thunder a lot. When you see him charge up his magic, charge forward
and ready a focus attack, then strike. Next, he'll charge up a poison cloud. This
has a large radius, and can poison you if you're caught. When you see him charge up
a green spell, retreat to behind the Goblin King and start striking wildy from
there. The final attack the Goblin King has doesn't damage you or cause any status
effects; some might not call it an attack. The Goblin King will vanish in a purple
light and teleport to a different part of the arena. If you follow his health meter,
you'll know where he is going to teleport.

Rush to that spot and charge a focus attack, then release when the Goblin King
reappears. Sometimes, the Goblin King will instantly teleport a second time once
he reappears, so be ready to release your focus attack quickly. Also, regular Go
Goblins will wander around the arena, disrupting your attack patterns. Whenever
they come on, defeat them to prevent you from losing HP. If you keep doing focus
attacks and casting powerful magic, you shouldn't have big problems with this
boss.

--------------------
CYCLES TWO AND THREE
--------------------
On the second cycle, the Goblin King will get a new move and upgrade an old one;
he'll start to cast Fira and Thundara. These have wider radei, and they can cause
more damage, so you'll want to make sure the items you have resist fire and thunder
before you enter.
*********************************************************************************

You should get a letter from your sister this time. Tell her thanks and send her a
nice gift. You are now officially 4/15 of the way to the end of the game. Yay!

|                              Vale of Alfitaria                    Y201      |
+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+

It's time again to cross over into another world, the Vale of Alfitaria. Once again,
you need to go through Miasma Streams, but you need to go to two this time. First,
make sure the element of your crystal chalice is fire. Now go to the first Miasma
Stream and cross through. When you get to the Iron Mine Downs, head to the Mushroom
Forest and change your chalice element to water. Now go to the Miasma Stream there
and cross over into the Vale of Alfitaria. The Vale is home to Alfitaria, the Mochet
Manor, and Tida. It is also the passageway to Veo Lu, but you won't go there until
later in the game. For now, head north into Alfitaria.

+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+
|                                 Alfitaria                         Y202      |
+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+

This busy and bustling town used to be ruled by Lilties and now it's a nice place
where you can get lots of good stuff. The tour will be started now. Head forward,
over the bridge, to find a HUGE crystal protecting the town. Head east all the way
then climb down the stairs and head all the way west. Examine the sewage area to
enter Alfitaria's Moogle Nest. Get your stamp and return to the crystal. Go west and
then climb down the stairs to find a MERCHANT SALESMAN. This is what he sells:

+-----------------------------+
|    MERCHANT SALESMAN        |
+-----------------------------+
|Bronze...............300 gil |
|Iron.................500 gil |
|Mythril..............5000 gil|
|Bronze Shard.........100 gil |
|Iron Shard...........100 gil |
|Alloy................250 gil |
+-----------------------------+
|          Scrolls            |
+-----------------------------+
|Warrior's Weapon.....300 gil |
|Iron Armor...........150 gil |
|Mythril Armor........300 gil |
|Mythril Shield.......250 gil |
|Iron Gloves..........100 gil |
|Mythril Gloves.......250 gil |
|Iron Sallet..........100 gil |
|Mythril Sallet.......250 gil |
|Iron Belt............100 gil |
|Mythril Belt.........250 gil |
------------------------------+

Note that this merchant only appears every other year.

Buy something or sell something, then head back up the stairs. Continue west, past
the giant staircase, until the examine symbol appears. You'll get another hidden
item. Now climb the stairs and you should see a knight going down. Speak to him and
you'll start a long sequence of events. This is what you must do:

(1) Speak to the knight in Alfitaria
(2) Head to Marr's Pass and speak to the man know as Te Odow
(3) Talk to the princess in the Jagon River
(4) Run into the first knight you saw (in Alfitaria) at the Jagon River
(5) Talk to the knight and the princess at the Fields of Fum
(6) Run into the knight and the princess in Leuda
(7) Exit Leuda and enter Alfitaria and watch the cinema scene.

By the time you reach step seven, you'll be at year six. Remember, you can't
complete each step right after the other, since some areas may not be available to
you at the moment. Whenever you can, do the following and after you watch the cinema
scene stated in step seven, you'll get 100,000 GIL! Who doesn't want to turn down
that kind of money? Now go down the stairs and continue east untikl you see an
orange building with a man standing in front of it. This is another MERCHANT. This
is what he sells:

+-----------------------------+
|    MERCHANT SALESMAN        |
+-----------------------------+
|Meat.................300 gil |
|Fish.................500 gil |
|Spring Water.........5000 gil|
|Milk.................100 gil |
+-----------------------------+

Buy some stuff if you wish, then go north, past the crystal, and then east. Stop
when you get to a green building with a man in front of it. This is the town's
BLACKSMITH, who deals with weapons and armor. Well, that concludes the guide for
Alfitaria. Forge any weapons/armor you want (if you don't have the Warrior's Weapon,
you should really get it; you'll need it for the next couple dungeons) and then buy
some nice items, talk to the knight here, and then exit.

Introduction for: Moschet Manor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is actually a mansion, but it isn't a very big one, though it may seem big due
to the size of the rooms. Really, this is one of the smaller dungeons, and you can
easily beat it in twenty minutes or so. There's less than ten rooms, and there's one
big "hub" room that links to all rooms. This is a little interesting, because you
have to eliminate enemies here rather than follow a path to the end. Once you
eliminate the specific enemies (mainly Tonberry Chefs), the boss battle will take
place in the hub room. I'd also like to say that while this DUNGEON isn't that hard,
the acutal BOSS is a freaking pain. Finally, if you look through other guides, you
might notice that all of them tell you to go to Tida first. I find that this is the
ideal place to visit first, since it's easier and it'll help you prepare more.

Main guide
~~~~~~~~~~

From Alfitaria, head south, west, and south to enter the Moschet Manor. Listen to
the narraration tells you that a dude named Jack was pissed because he was starving,
and his wife Maggie was pissed because her dinner wasn't ready. Sorta strange, but
oh well. Anyway, the main area you start in is also the boss area, and the "hub"
area that links to the other seven rooms. There are nine switches in the hub room
that open doors. You must defeat all Tonberry Chefs to make Jack, the boss (a.k.a.
the Gigas Lord) to show up. At the start, head left to find a strange switch with
odd symbols changing every seven or eight seconds. The symbols are symbols of the
different races, and you have to wait until your race's symbol is shown before you
can step on it.

Try to step on the switch for each symbol, and when it finally goes down wait a few
seconds and the door will open. Head through and open the chest to get some gil.
Maggie will mistake you for a Tonberry chef and order you to return to the kitchen.
Exit the room and head to the room directly opposite it. Open the door when your
symbol is shown and once inside, you'll find a Gremlin and a Tonberry Chef. Defeat
the Gremlin, and then defeat your first Chef. Open the treasure chest before
leaving. Back in the main room, head to the center area and try to defeat all the
enemies. If you can't defeat the gargoyles becasue you don't have gravity, wait
until you can get gravity. Now go up to the middle room on the right side and enter
it when you can step on the switch.

Eliminate all of the Tonberry Chefs in this room (there's a few). Once they're gone,
head north up to the third room on the right side and use the switch to open the
door. Here, head back up to behind the bed to find the Tonberry Chef. Kill it and
then open the chest in this room. Head back outside once more and open the door in
the very back of the hub room. Kill the two chefs here, as well as the Gargoyles,
then head outside again. Go west and step on the switch there. Enter the room here.
Defeat the two Tonberry Chefs, then you should notice three small sets of steps.
Climb each of them (heading counter-clockwise) and read all the books for some
interesting info. When you're ready, head outside and go south. Open the door and
head through.

Defeat the final Tonberry Chef and then open the chest. Also, go around the table
until you can examine a hole, which is the Moogle Nest. Grab your stamp and then
prepare yourself with powerful spells. Once you head outside, you'll fight the boss.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BOSS: Gigas Lord & Maggie
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Without multiple players to fight this boss battle, the Gigas Lord is one hell of a
tough boss. You only have to defeat the Gigas Lord (really Jack Mochet) to win, but
it's recommended that you always take care of Maggie whenever she appears on the
field. First off, the Gigas Lord easily resists Thunder, Slow, and Stop, and Gravity
and Blizzard don't do much either. Fire does a good amount of damage, and Holy does
a great deal. Try to get Fira or Fiagra so you can hit both Maggie and the Gigas
Lord at once. Now, the Gigas Lord and Maggie both have different attacks. First, the
Gigas Lord can run a LOT faster than you, so he'll usually run up and then jump. If
he lands on you, you'll suffer lots of damage. If he lands near you, the force of
the impact will cause a slight bit of damage to you.

The Gigas Lord also likes to use his powerful breath, which can knock off a few
hearts in one hit! Whenever you see him inhale, get to the side or behind him and
start swiping until he stops. Now, Maggie doesn't stay the whole battle. When you
attack the Gigas Lord for the first time, she'll appear. Maggie's only attack is
Sloga, but that's a dangerous one. Also, the Gigas Lord has a new attack whenever
Maggie gets on the field. It's not a damaging attack, but a cure attack. The Gigas
Lord will stop moving for a moment and heal both himself and Maggie to full health.
That is one of the reason's why this battle takes so long, and another reason why
you want to get Maggie out of the arena as quickly as possible. Whenever Maggie is
around, don't focus your attacks on the Gigas Lord, unless your attacks can hit both
Maggie and the Gigas Lord at the same time.

You'll want to use powerful spells on Maggie until she leaves the screen. You don't
see her health bar, so you won't be able to tell how much damage you've done to her.
Make sure to avoid her Slowga spell, or the Gigas Lord will be able to seriously
hurt you. You REALLY need Cure during this battle, because your health will probably
drop a lot during the fight. Once you totally deplete Maggie's HP, she'll run in
front of the southwest door and you won't be able to attack her anymore. She's now
out of the battle, so you can focus totally on the Gigas Lord. Make sure to use
powerful Fire or Holy spells, and this is one of those battles where you DON'T want
to use any type of physical attack. The Gigas Lord has a swipe that can knock off at
least a heart and a half if you approach.

As long as you keep curing yourself and if you take Maggie out of the battle
quickly, you should be okay.

--------------------
CYCLES TWO AND THREE
--------------------
During the second and third cycles, Maggie will start using Stop. This freezes you
in your tracks, allowing the Gigas Lord to constantly beat on you. This is VERY
dangerous, since the Gigas Lord will definitely take away lots of HP, and probably
kill you. Remember, take Maggie out as soon as possible when she appears.

You'll receive your second drop of Myrrh for year two. When you leave the Manor,
head north, to the starnge looking town north of Alfitaria. This town is known as
Tida.

Introduction for: Tida
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tida is a village whose crystal protected the villagers from the miasma. One year,
the carvan set out and never returned, causing all villagers to fall to their death
as the miasma claimed their lives. This can be a tough area, and it can be pretty
annoying also when you have to get around the constant spider webs that appear.

Main guide
~~~~~~~~~~

Listen to the narration here. Tida was originally a nice little town like every
other town. However, their cyrstal's power was deplenished. The caravan never return
and everyone in Tida suffered due to miasma. That's gonna happen to Tipa if you
don't get a move on, so let's go! At the start, head left to find a treasure chest.
Grab the item inside and then go east. Continue heading east until you are able to
go north. Defeat the enemy as you go up, then open the treasure chest. Head south
and continue east when you can, defeating the enemies. Then go north, up the big
stone path. When you are able to go west, do so. You'll be high up on a cliff, but
don't worry about falling off, since you can't. When you get to the other side,
defeeat all the enemies.

The head south and defeat all enemies there. The Bomb should drop a key, and it can
be placed in the pedestal with the ivy covering it. You can't place the key in until
the ivy is gone, so charge up a Fire spell to burn the ivy off. Open the gate and
head on through, then defeat the massive hoards of enemies inside. Once you have,
Cure (you'll probably have suffered some damage) and then open the two chests found
in the northwest and southeast corners. Head back outside and continue down south.
When you get to the wide space (without any enemies), open the two chests and then
approach the entrance to the deserted house. Examine it to enter the Moogle Nest for
Tida. Grab your stamp and then head back outside. Backtrack all the way to the area
where the cliff ended (it is north, above the pedestal that had ivy).

Continue north, past that cliff area, and defeat all the enemies here. You should
pass a key pedestal, so defeat the enemies near the pedestal to reveal the key.
Don't open the door yet. Continue east, fighting all enemies, and open the chest at
the very end. Now you can head back to the key and open the door. Head north to
enter the second area of this dungeoin. When you are there, go north some more and
then east. You should find some strange spider-web things here. Head to the left one
and if you have Fire magic, you can burn it. If you don't have Fire, hit it a lot
with your weapon to have it break. Break through three of these slimy spores to get
to a treasue chest. Open it and head back to the area with the spores and the hot
spot.

Bust open the middle spore if you want to defeat an enemy, and then open the right
spore. Defeat the enemy there, then open the right spore again. Here, defeat the two
Bombs, then burn the ivy off the pedestal. Use the key dropped by one of the Bombs
to open the door. Head into this next big area and go all the way south, where you
can open two treasure chests. Now head north all the way until you run into a spore,
which you should burn. Now head north and then go left when you reach the top. Burn
the spore and defeat the enemy you reveal. Burn the next spore then defeat the
enemies in the garden in the next area. Continue west and you should find a spore
south. Burn it to reveal a chest. Grab it and continue west to find yet another
chest.

Now, you should've passed a bridge on your way to that second chest. Cross it and
defeat all the enemies here to reveal a key. Now make sure you have powerful spells
(you should have at least Fira, and you might even have Fiagra) and you have full
health before opening the gate.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BOSS: Armstrong
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Armstrong looks like he was made out of a destroyed house. Would've been cooler if
he was made out of the ruins of Tida's crystal but meh. Anyway, Armstrong is another
tough boss to fight. Like I mention earlier, you should definitely have Fira, and
maybe Fiagra if you're lucky. Fiagra does MAJOR damage to Armostrong, while Fira
does moderate damage. Regular Fire does almost nothing at all, so I sugest you try
to get a higher magic level. Okay, Armstrong has a few tough attacks that you'll
have to watch out for during the battle. The first one is a needle type attack.
Armstrong will stop for a brief moment and fire a couple dozen needles at you. If
you keep moving, you'll avoid them easily. Armstrong also has a cannon that fires a
ball of ice at you.

If you are at a distance, he'll shoot but he usually won't use it if you're close
up. This can take a few hearts away from your health, so I suggest that you keep
moving and staying close up. Don't get TOO close though, or Armstrong will use his
swip attack, which can also eat up some of your health. Another attack Armstrong has
is a breath attack (all bosses in this game seem to have one =P). Armstrong will
inhale, which means you should move around to the side or the back. He'll then
exhale some poison gas. If you moved to the side or the back, you can avoid it
easily. If you didn't, then you'll have a tough time. A final attack Armstrong has
is a purple gas that surrounds him. He'll release it and it'll cast Slow on you if
you're touched.

Make sure to move back when you see the gas. Armstrong has tough defense, and
Thunder, Slow, and Stop do almost no damage to him. Blizzard and Gravity are okay,
but Holy and Fire are the best. Like the fight with the Gigas Lord and Maggie, you
won't want to use physical attacks here. Stick to Fire or Holy magic. The skeletons
that rise up from the ground are also vulnerable to fire, so Fiagra can REALLY help
you here, because it can take a big chunk out of Armstrong's health meter and
totally wipe out the skeletons. They like to cast magic also, which is all the more
reason to wipe them out. If you always take out the skeletons and keep using Fire on
Armstrong from a distance, you shouldn't have any major problems with this boss.

--------------------
CYCLES TWO AND THREE
--------------------
On cycle two, Armstrong's ice cannon will cause Stop on your character if you're
hit. This shouldn't be a problem, since you shouldn't stay that far away from
Armstrong anyway. On cycle three, Armstrong will also equip a Curse effect to the
cannon, but you still should be able to easily avoid it.
*********************************************************************************

Write a polite reply to your letter and then choose your artifact. Your second year
is now up! Watch the ceremony and read your diary entries and you'll begin year
three! Talk to your parents in Tipa to get some nice items or money, then head out
of Tipa. Watch the cinema scene with the old man and woman and you'll find yourself
back on the world map.

+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+

You have to cross three Miasma Streams in order to get to Veo Lu. On the Tipa
Peninsula, head to the River Belle Path. Notice that you can get myrrh from the
tree, but we're not going to do that now, k? Instead, change your element to wind.
Now cross the Miasma Stream over to the Iron Mine Downs. Head to the Mine of
Cathigures and change the element to Fire. Cross the Miasma Stream here to enter the
Vale of Alfitaira. In the Vale, go to the Mochet Manor and change the element to
water. Then cross the Miasma Stream here to finall enter Veo Lu. Veo Lu is home to
only two things: Veo Lu Sluice and the town Shella, home of the Yukes. Here, you can
try to enter Shella. If you are a Yuke, you'll be able to go in. If you're not, you
need to head to Veo Lu Sulice first and get the Shella Mark.

There's a chance that not everyone here is a Yuke, so I won't cover Shella until
we're done with Veo Lu Sulice.

Introduction to: Veo Lu Sluice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Veo Lu Sluice is a strange place. When you first enter it during year three, you'll
notice staircases leading into the water. You can't access the areas underwater
until year five, when the Jegon River dries up. That will reveal eight more treasure
chests full or artifacts and some enemies that carry certain rarities as well. This
level also shows off the water graphics for this game, which are beautiful. It is
also a challenging dungeon, due to the many tough enemies here that can take at
least a heart out of your health. :(

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Main guide for: Veo Lu Sluice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This strange dungeon is different in years three and four than it is to years five
through eight. During the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth years, parts of the
Jegon River will dry up, and that will make parts in Veo Lu Sluice dry up too. When
the parts are dried up, you'll be able to collect more items and defeat some more
enemies. For now, we're just going to take the path while the water is full. Let me
also note that there is no element type in Veo Lu Sluice, probably because there's
no Miasma Stream here that takes you to new lands. I'll guide you through the bigger
path during the fifth year, when about six more areas become available. The
narraration explains that Lilties kept this area safe, and people walked the path
without fear.

She'll explain a lot more about different areas that don't seem to have to do with
anything about the Veo Lu Sulice but ah well. When you start off, head east and
defeat the enemies. Continue east (make sure you're as high north as possible) to
encounter a dead end with a chest. When you have it, go south and follow the turn to
the left. Now go north, and go around the river. You should find a switch, a chest,
and a few enemies here. Note that enemies are the ones that carry the Shella Marks,
so defeat as many as possible to get one. When you have full health, step on the
switch (open the chest too for an item). You should notice that a water spout
outside the force field has sprung up. Place the chalice on the switch and quickly
run outside of the force field and grab the key.

The miasma will make you drop the key, but you can pick up the chalice and carry it
over to saftey. Pick up the key and carry it south, then east for a whiole. Drop it
to defeat the Lizardmans and Gigan Toads, and when you get all the way east you'll
find a pedestal south. Drop the key in to open the gate. Head south here and then go
east to find a little corner with a treasure chest. Now go west all the way to find
a treasure chest tucked back behind a little circular area surrounded bya  fence.
Grab the chest and start heading south. Head west when you can and do that for a
while. When you run into a closed gate, head south again and climb down the stairs
that are to your right. Head east for a long time and you'll find some enemies
guarding a chest.

Defeat the enemies and then open the chest. Now head back all the way and return to
the closed gate you saw earlier. Again, you have to place the chalice on the switch
and rush over to the water spout to retrieve the key. This time, the water spout
should be inside your force field, so you won't be hit by the miasma. So anyway,
open the gate and head on through. Go north when you go through the gate and then
defeat the Water Flan, Lizardmans, and Griffin. I should note that you should have a
Shella Mark by now, but if you don't, makes sure to continue killing enemies. Now
heal yourself to full health and then go east. You should find a switch. Place the
chalice on and a water spout quite a distance away will appear. You have to run
through a lot of miasma to get to it, which is why I had you heal.

Grab the key and rush back to the chalice, then have Mog pick the chalice up and go
back to the key once more. Carry it west and place it in the pedestal. DON'T go
through yet, since that's the entrance to the boss. We still have a few things to
do, so wait a little. Head north and follow the path around the lake, defeating the
enemies. At the end are a bunch of enemies, like some Water Flans, Lizardmans, and
Griffin. These enemies drop two great artifacts: The Moon Pendant, which increases
your health by a single heart, and the Ring of Blizzard, which allows you to start
every dungeon with the Blizzard Magicite. That makes it a lot easier to get Blizzaga
ready to use! Also, when you reach the north part of this lake, with all the
enemies, go all the way east.

You should be right below a cliff. Run up and down here until you can examine a
hole, which is the Moogle Nest. Chances are, you have Blizzara already, so paint
your moogle blue so it'll cast Blizzard, which allows you to fuse them and form
Blizzaga. You're now all done here, so return to the boss gate, get poweful magic
ready, heal, and enter.

~~~~~~~~~~~
BOSS: Golem
~~~~~~~~~~~
Golem is like that boss Thardus in Metroid Prime, the one made out of all the rocks.
Golem has five tough attacks, that can all do some good damage in one way or
another. The first attack is a blue gas. Golem will run up to you and unleash some
blue gas that will surround him. This gas will cast slow on you, so make sure to
avoid it when you see it coming. Golem also likes to fire his two fists at you. They
aren't homing, and they fire in a straight line, but if either hits you, you're
going to suffer major damage. When you see him fire his fists either stay in the
middle of them or move out of the way to the left or right. If you're hit, you'll
suffer some major damage. The third attack is another dangerous one that can piss
you off.

Golem will run forward and shoot two lasers out at you. If you're hit, you'll lose a
bit of health AND be frozen. Being frozen is very dangerous, because there's always
a chance you'll be hit even more and take double the damage. The fourth attack is a
simple swipe that Golem likes to use when he's up close to you. If you keep running,
he shouldn't use it that much, but remember that he is faster than you, so you'll
probably be hit a couple of times during the battle. The final attack only happens
when you take Golem's health down to 50%. He'll get pissed and fire a second laser,
but this one will be red instead of blue. He'll turn in a circle while firing the
laser. When you see this attack, RUN AWAY! It means that he's about to use his
dangerous fire attack.

This attack isn't quite Fiagra, but it's quite like it. A huge ring of fire will
appear around Golem, and if you're hit you'll lose some HP as well as get burned.
Throughout this battle, Ice Flans will constantly appear. Always take care of them,
since their only attack casts slow on you. They appear a LOT during the battle, but
never try to ignore them or you'll get in trouble. Golem isn't exactly that weak to
anything, except for maybe Holy. Fire, Blizzard, Thunder, and Gravity moves all do
okay damage to him, and Stop and Slow moves won't effect him at all. I suggest that
you stick with Blizzard moves, since you should have a lot of Ice Magicite. Usually,
you'll get two Ice Magicite in the level, allowing you to cast Blizzara. If you
painted Mog blue, he'll cast Blizzard, so you can fuse Blizzara and Blizzard to make
Blizzaga.

Also, if you have the Ring of Blizzard, you already have Blizzard. Combine that with
the two Ice Magicite you get in the level and you'll be able to use Blizzaga on your
own, which is VERY useful.

--------------------
CYCLES TWO AND THREE
--------------------
Nothing changes in cycle two, but during cycle three, Golem will add a new, more
powerful attack to the five he already has. When Golem points his fists to the
sides, retreat. He'll unleash a whirlwind which, if it hits you, will cause massive
damage.
*********************************************************************************

When it comes to choosing your artifact, you should have two great things to choose
from: the Moon Pendant and the Blizzard Ring. On your first visit, select the Moon
Pendant, which increases your health by a single heart. Right when you exit the
dungeon, re-enter and go through it again, but this time choose the Blizzard Ring as
your artifact. You may want to play it a third time to get another valuable artifact
that would raise one of your stats by two. Anyway, now that you have the Blizzard
Ring, things just got a whole lot easier.

+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+

You shouuld have the Mark of Shella by the time you've beaten the Veo Lu Sulice. If
you went through twice (or maybe three times) like I suggested you should definitely
have the Mark. So when you enter Shella, talk to the old man and he'll spawn a
rainbow-type bridge. Cross it and you'll run into two men. They are both merchants.
Here's what the man on the left sells...

+-----------------------------+

|Strange Liquid........20 gil |
|Shella Mark...........50 gil |

|New Clockwork.........100 gil|
|Blue Yarn.............100 gil|
|White Yarn............100 gil|
|Gold Craft............100 gil|
+-----------------------------+

After you shop around, go a tiny bit north to find a tree by the merchants. Examine
it to enter the Moogle's Nest. Collect your stamp and then exit. Now continue
heading north until you find the town's crystal. There's a man walking around the
crystal. Talk to him constantly to learn more about the miasma. Head south now to
find the ACCESSORY BLACKSMITH. He can only craft accessories, which is basically
what the salesmen here sell. Now go north to the crystal again, and go around to the
back. You should find two paths, right and left, heading north. Take the left one
first and you should find a bunch of people talking. Talk to them to learn some
interesting info. Now head back to the crystal and take the opposite path. You
shoulge find a big house.

Locate the two barrels and examine them to find a secret item. You're done here, so
exit Shella.

NOTE: NEVER throw away your Mark of Shella, becuase the bridge vanishes every time
you exit. If you toss the Mark away, you'll have to go to Veo Lu Sluice and retrive
another Mark again!

+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+

Our next stop is at the Plains of Fum, a place which is hole to two more Myrrh Tress
and the town known as the Fields of Fum. From Shella, head to the Miasma Stream and
make your way through. At the Vale of Alfitaira, head to Moschet Manor and change
your element to fire. Then make your way back to the Iron Mine Downs. Head to the
Jegon River, near Marr's Pass. In the River, head to the Pier and talk to the man.
Ask him to take you to the other side of the River for 50 gil. He'll take you to the
Plains of Fum. Here, you'll be on the west side of the Jegon River. As you're
heading north, you should find an opening in the fence with a hole in the mountain.
Go through the hole to find the Moogle Nest. Get your stamp then continue north, out
of Jegon River.

+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+
|                              Plains of Fum                        Y304      |
+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+

The Plains of Fum is home to the Fields of Fum. At the Fields, you can get all these
different fruits. This place is also home to Daemon's Court, as well as the
Selepation Cave. Also, the Miasma Stream to the Rebena Plains is here, but you're
not going there yet. Note that starting on the fifth year, the Jegon River will dry
up all the way to the seventh year. This prevents you from reaching the Plains. You
can restore the water earlier though, which will grant you more access. For now,
head east to get to the Fields of Fum.

+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+
|                              Fields of Fum                        Y305      |
+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+

Although there are no blacksmiths in the Fields of Fum, it's a very nice place to
get fruit that you need and you can also do one of the coolest things in the game:
race cows! Yeah! At the start, head right and go past the two people. Near the
bridge, walk around near the tree and the stump until you can examine the area.
You'll get a hidden item. Now go across the bridge and you should find a Selkie.
This Selkie sells useful materials and scrolls, but only appears on the third,
fifth, and seventh years. It's currently the third year, so go and buy as much stuff
as you want from him.

+-----------------------------+

You can wander around a little bit until you reach a huge area with cows. Walk
around the fence a little until you see a lady on the inside of the fence. She'll
offer to sell you a cow for 500 Gil, which you can send to your family. Now continue
until you walk past the crystal. Talk to the women here and she'll offer to sell you
some fruits.

+-----------------------------+

Now head south, past the crystal, and continue down the path until you encounter a
wooden door. Enter it and you'll be inside the Moogle's Nest. Collect your stamp and
then exit. Your done at the Fields, so exit them now.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Introduction for: Daemon's Court
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Daemon's Court is the first dungeon that represents a real challenge. Here, powerful
enemies come in groups of six or seven, all trying to attack you, while you're
despartely trying to run away from them to heal. And then you're trying to charge up
a magic spell and another enemy sneaks up from behind you and shoots a projectile
that takes away a chunk of health. If you haven't mastered the controls by now, then
you're in BIG trouble when you get to this level.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Main guide for: Daemon's Court
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NOTE: When playing this level, two random enemies will drop keys. DO NOT pick these
keys up right away! Wait until I say so!

Head south, west, and north to enter the Court. The narraration explains that an old
man told the narrarator to never underestimate the power of the monster. What the
hell does that have to do with Daemon's Court? Anyway, at the start, climb the steps
onto the wooden platform. Defeat the enemy here and head to the east side of the
platform. You should notice a strange catapult that has a rock in it. Striking these
catapults will send stones at monsters, but you only get one shot per catapult. Use
these to defeat powerful monsters. Anyway, head east until you reach a treasure
chest. This chest has one of four magicites (Fire, Blizzard, Thunder, or Cure) for
you to grab. Pray that it has cure, although Blizzard isn't that bad since you can
fuse it with the Blizzard Ring for Blizzara.

Return to the platform and stand on it while using magic to defeat the enemies here.
You can't defeat the Wraith yet, not until you have Holy magic, so ignore it for
now. From the start of the level, go north for a while and you'll climb up some
stairs and onto a higher, wooden level. Head south and defeat the Lizard Soldier,
and continue to go south to find a chest containing the Life Magicite. Combine the
Life spell with your Blizzard Ring to get Holy (you can also combine it with Fire or
Thunder if you ignored what I said and didn't get the Blizzard Ring). You can now
damage Wraiths. For now, head north, past the stairs, and deffeat the Lizard Wizard.
Open the chest here to get some Pheonix Down. You need one to survive here, since
the enemies are tough.

Now climb back down the stairs and head north. On the little platform, defeat the
tough Lizard Warrior. It takes four or five Holy spells to cure him, and he packs a
hard punch, so have some Cure magic ready. Once he's gone, get off the platform and
open the chest that's to the left of it. Once the chest is open, go east. You should
find a Bomb hovering over a bridge. If you try to cross the bridge, you'll find out
that it's not possible. However, you can defeat the Bomb with Holy spells and it'll
explode, causing the bridge to blow up and head into the river again. Right now,
exit Daemon's Court and get onto the World Map. Re-enter it and grab all the magic
and chests and stuff and make your way through until you get to that same bridge
again. Blow it up once more.

You may be asking yourself, "Why the hell did I just do that?" Trust me, it'll help
you in the long run. Okay, so after you've blown up the bridge for the second time,
head south and you'll find a bridge that you can actually cross over. Have some
wide-range magic ready and defeat everyone here. Then head west more and locate a
set of steps that will take you to a small wooden area. Head south and defeat teh
enemies, then open the chest. Now go north and defeat the enemies there and open the
chest that you find. Once you've opened both chests, climb down the stairs and then
go north to find another set of stairs. Climb them and defeat the enemies as you go
along, but go SLOWLY. When you are about halfway through with this part, a HUGE
swarm of Lizards will come at you.

You'll really want a spell with a big radius, like one of the level three spells. If
by some miracle you can make Blizzaga, USE IT! That can freeze pretty much everyone
at once and it does major damage. Otherwise, stick to a level two spell. Blizzard
spells work best because they can freeze, but Thunder spells are okay too, since
they paralyze. Anyway, once you have finally defeated all of the evil enemies,
continue forward. Keep running, past the steps going down, until you get to the very
end of this area. Here, defeat all the Lizards and open the chest. Now backtrack to
the set of stairs that you just passed. Head down and defeat the enemies, then go
past the set of steps. Open the chest here for a nice item. Now return to the steps
you just passed and climb down.

Go up to the small platform and defeat the enemies there. Then head south and climb
the stair set. Go north and defeat the enemies, then open the chest for a Moon
Pendant or Chocobo Pocket (it's random). You might even get mythril from one of the
enemies! Now go down the stairs and head all the way north. Defeat the Wraith with
Holy and then the Killer Bee. When you're up against the back wall, walk under the
set of steps to your right. Examine the wall to enter the Moogle Nest. Okay, now
you've probably noticed that enemies dropped keys along when you were fighting. The
enemies who dropped the keys are always random, so I can't tell you where to find
them. Anyway, grab each key and place it in the pedestal that's right in front of
the boss door (which is a little to the left of the entrance).

When both are in place, heal and enter to fight the Lizard King.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BOSS: Lizardman King
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Lizardman King isn't that hard, depsite the fact that this dungeon probably
drove you freaking mad. What makes this battle hard is the actual enemies that
accompany the Lizardman King when you're fighting him. Coeurls and Lizard Skrimisher
(those annoying Lizards that shoot projectiles at you) like to roam the area, and
you won't be able to survive this battle until you take them both out. There's a
small chance that you'll have a level three Magic (Fiagra, Blizzaga, or Thundaga) if
you defeated every enemy in Daemon's Court. The best magic to have would be blizzard
magic, since it can freeze enemies. The Lizardman King is very weak to Holy (who
isn't?), and Fire, Slow, and Stop do nearly no damage to it at all, so I suggest not
bringing those types of magic along.

At the start of the battle, two Coeurls and a Lizard Skirmisher will run at you.
Take them out first, or they'll constantly stalk you throughout the battle and
you'll suffer some serious damage. Once you're gone, you only have to worry about
the Lizardman King's two attacks (yeah, he only has two) for a while. The first
attack involves him thrusting his claw forward at you. This attack can make take a
LOT of hearts away, so keep moving and never get too close to the Lizardman King and
you should be fine. The second attack is just like the Skirmisher's attack; the King
will stop and shoot five big projectiles out all at once. If it hits you, you'll
take a lot of damage, but he only shoots the projectiles out in front of him, so
there isn't any major worrying to be done here.

Blizzard and Thunder spells work best here. You really should use magic instead of
trying to defeat him with pysichal attacks, or the giant claw will get you. Also,
there's a unique thing in this arena that can help you: saws. You should notice red
switches in the corner of the arena when you're fighting the battle. If you stand on
this switch for a few seconds, it'll click and then saw blades will drive through
the sand. This can hurt you, enemies, and the Lizardman King. Use the saw blades if
you have no powerful magic.

--------------------
CYCLES TWO AND THREE
--------------------
The Lizardman King will start to shoot fire at you during the second cycle, and
he'll switch to ice during the third cycle. These can burn and freeze you
respectively, but they are easy to avoid.
*********************************************************************************

After Daemon's Court, you should encounter a cut-scene with Sol Racht, telling you
about a dark flan. He'll warn you of the flans, then leave.

Introduction for: Selepation Cave
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Slepation Cave is where wind is born, which is a nice concept. Like Daemon's Court,
this place sure as hell isn't a cakewalk. There are a lot of tough enemies, and they
also like to appear in groups. The groups aren't as big as in Daemon's Court (here,
they're only like three and four at a time), but the enemies are MUCH tougher. Also,
this is a huge area with a lot of different routes you can take. One allows you to
get to the boss in about five minutes, but doing that makes you miss out on the
other 7/8 of the dungeon.

Main guide for: Selepation Cave
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From Daemon's Court, head south and then east a little bit, then go toward the blue
looking palace, which is Selepation Cave. The narraration will explain that every
gust of wind is born from this cave. Once you're done listening, prepare your
command list and then start off. Go north and then east, defeating the enemies, but
stop when you get near the entrance to another area. Head west then, and go west for
a LONG while. When you see the purple switches and a gate, continue past.
Eventually, you'll come to a treasure chest, so open it and grab the item. Let me
note that by the time you open the chest, you should have a ****load of each
Magicite, except for Life. You should be able to make Fira, Blizzara, Thundara, and
Gravity by now.

Choose your favorite (I recommend Fira, since the Gigas, the toughest enemy here, is
very weak to it) and then head back to the gate and purple switch. In single player
mode, there are two purple switches and in multiplayer mode, there are three. These
switches must be hit simultaneously in order for the gate to open. Use focus
attacks; they can hit both at the same time. Once the gate opens, head on through
and defeat the enemies here. Go west, and defeat the Blazer Beetle, then go north
and climb the stairs on your left. Open the chest and then continue north, following
the path. Use the focus attack technique when you reach the purple switches again to
open the gate. Head on through, defeating the enemies as you go by. Kill the two
Blazer Beetles near the end and head on into the next area.

Go north here and then when you come to a split, head left. Continue going left and
then north for quite a while. Make sure to defeat all the enemies you encounter or
you'll end up trapped. When you can't go north anymore, head east to find a treasure
chest. Open it, and then backtrack all the way to the split (where you took the left
path). Take the right path and head east for a while until you come to a treasure
chest. Now do some small backtracking and then head south for a while to enter the
next area. Head south here for a while, defeating the enemies. Keep going south,
past the area with the elevator, and then go east. Head south when you can and climb
the stairs. Defeat the enemies and open the two treasure chests, then go down the
stairs again.

To your right is an elevator. Have both you and Mog climb on and it'll lower. When
it does, go north and defeat the Gigas. It looks like there's nothing here, but you
can actually climb the small slope on your left, and it'll take you to a treasure
chest. Now go back to the elevator and head up to the upper floor again. Go north,
then east to find another elevator. Get on and it'll lower to another area again. Go
north once more, and then head west. Defeat the Lizard Captain and the Lizardman
here, and then open the treasure chest for a nice artifact. Return to the elevator
and take it up to the upper floor again. Head east for a long time, north, and then
east again to find the third and final elevator. Take it down and then go north.
Defeat the enemies and open the chest.

Take the elevator back up once more, and then return to the first elevator. Take it
down, but head south this time and then go east until you enter the next area. Here,
go north, but beware of the blue holes. Go north and east here and climb the small
set of stairs. Go north here, fighting the Sahagins, and climb the next small set of
stairs. Go north, taking the only path available. Continue going north as you hug
the right wall. Continue to huge the wall as it turns east. You'll be in a closed
area with a treasure chest and some enemies. Open the chest and then go down,
hugging the left wall. You'll eventually come to some purple switches. Hit them to
open the gate, then check to see if you're at full health, and go on through to face
the Cave Worm.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BOSS: Cave Worm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After seeing the Cave Worm, you may be thinking that a tough battle is ahead. Well,
you're right. This is a tough battle, a very tough one I might add. The Cave Worm
has attacks that can deplete three or four hearts at once, and then the electric
jellyfish that always move around the arena don't help either. The only good thing
about the Cave Worm is that its attacks are limited in range, so you can go near the
back of the arena to heal and be totally safe from the Worm's attacks. Its just
trying to get AWAY from the attacks that's hard. Really hard. Okay, the Cave Worm
has five attacks that are all very annoying, except for one, which can actually help
you. The first attack is the most common one. The Cave Worm will reveal it's huge
mouth and start to spray sand everywhere.

This takes off about three hearts, so when you see the flaps move out of the way,
get to the side to avoid being blasted by the sand. The second attack doesn't damage
you, and it can be helpful. The Cave Worm will do an inhaling attack similar to
Malboro's; this attack will cause you to be sucked forward, but it doesn't cause
damage. Rush toward him when he starts inhaling and charge up a focus attack and
then slash. The third attack only occurs when you get too close to him. He'll simply
swipe at you and take away three hearts. Ugh. The fourth attack is a huge bubble
that, if it hits you, casts Slow. The flaps in front of the Cave Worm's mouth will
disappear and then he'll shoot a HUGE blue bubble out. He does this all very
quickly, so make sure to keep moving.

The final attack happens only when you get his HP down pretty low. If you get close,
the Cave Worm will jump up (how the hell does it lift that body up?) and slam down,
releasing a shockwave that will take away about five (!!!) hearts if you're hit.
Okay, the Cave Wrom resists Blizzard, Slow, and Stop, and Ffire, Thunder, and
Gravity don't do much damage either. Holy does the most magic damage, but that STILL
doesn't help, because Holy never really does massive amounts of damage anyway. So
don't use magic. No, the best way to go would be to use Focus Attacks non-stop. Just
keep charging and doing Focus Attacks to slowly sap the Cave Worm's health, and
retreat to cure yourself when you're low on hearts (which will happen quite a bit, I
might add).

Whenever the Electric Jellyfish show up, kill 'em. You don't want to have to deal
with them AND the Cave Worm at the same time. Just remember that using your main
weapon on the jellyfish will cause you to lose HP.

--------------------
CYCLES TWO AND THREE
--------------------
On the second cycle, the Cave Worm will gain points in attack and defense, so he'll
take away even MORE HP and take even longer to kill. His attack and defense will
increase even more during the third cycle, so I hope you have a good amount of
health and a strong weapon ready.
*********************************************************************************

After you beat the Worm, you'll get your final drop of Myrrh for year three! Yay! So
you'll head back to Tipa for the traditional celebration, then set off on year four!
3/5 done! Remember, talk to your parents to get a nice item. When you begin to set
off, you'll run into Sol Racht again and learn more about the Black Night.

+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+

From Tipa, head to the Goblin Wall and get your chalice element changed to Earth.
Now cross the Miasma Stream into the Iron Mine Downs. Here, SAVE YOUR GAME! You'll
see why in a second. You'll also want to head to another Moogle Nest and cut Mog's
hair, since Mount Kilanda is so hot. Now head to the Jegon River and talk to
Tristan, who will say that the hull has been re-done, allowing you to sail farther.
Tell him you want to go to Mount Kilanda. Pay up 500 gil and you'll sail there. Once
you get to Kilanda, you'll automatically enter Mount Kilanda, so you won't be able
to save your game.

~~~~~~~~~~~~
Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mount Kilanda is a strange place, since the moment you enter Kilanda you'll go into
Mount Kilanda. This prevents you from viewing the World Map menu while you're on
here. Also, the only way to exit this area is by boat, and you have the option of
heading to the east or west side of the Jegon River when you leave. This place is
big, and it is also very hot, so trimming Mog's hair will make your journey easier.
The boss is interesting, since the difficutly level of the boss depends on whether
you defeated certain enemies in the main dungeon. Either way, it's still a difficult
battle.

Main guide

The narraration is a poem! Cool! Once it's done, the ship will arrive at the
mountain's base. Now, if you didn't cut Mog's hair, he won't be able to carry the
chalice for very long, so make sure you've done so. At the start, go southwest to
find a chest containing a random magicite. Now head north and then east and defeat
the lot of Lava Ahrimans, the Lava Mu, and the Lamia. Then open the two chests you
see there and grab the nice things inside. Now go back west and head north a little
more. When you get to an urn, head southwest, down the small path. At the end are
two treasure chests for you to open. Get the items inside and defeat the Lava
Ahrimans and Lava Mu, then head back to the urn. Placing it inside the small volcano
will cause a bridge to rise, which you can use to cross.

Carefully place this urn inside the volcano (if you mess up, then don't worry; you
can just go around) and then cross it. When you get to the other side, head west for
a little bit and then you'll spot a treasure chest. Open it and then defeat the Lava
Mu and Blazer Beetle. Now head north up the path and go left when you reach the
split. Continue north into the next area. Here, IMMIDIATELY defeat the Goblin with
the sword, then head south a little and east, then take out the sword Goblin there.
You'll see why later. Head back to where you defeated the first Goblin and start to
head north. You'll run into a lot of Coeurls, Lamias, Lava Ahrimans, Lava Mu, and
Orges while you're going north. Now, this area is a little too difficult to describe
totally, so I'll just tell you this: search around.

There's a total of three treasure chests you can find. DON'T cross over to the areas
that are light orange until you have gotten all three treasure chests. When you do
have those chests, prepare some good spells and enter one of the three light orange
areas.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BOSS: Iron Giant
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At the start, you'll see some Goblins approach and bring the Iron Giant some swords.
There will be zero to three swords presented to the Giant depending on how many
Goblins you destroyed. He'll take the swords then kill one of the Goblins, and the
rest will rush off. Okay, when you start, he'll have a sword with him, even if you
miracuously managed to wipe out all three sword Goblins. This is one of those bosses
where physical attacks work best. No, not FOCUS attacks. Just the regular 1-2-3
Combo attack, which can bring down his HP faster than any other method (unless you
have a level three Blizzard spell, which I don't think you have). This is a unique
boss, because it's attacks will be different depending on if he has a sword or if he
doesn't have one.

The Iron Giant isn't effected by Thunder, Slow, Stop, or Gravity, and Holy does,
again, lots of damage. But the 1-2-3 attack works best, so always stick with that.
Okay, the Iron Giant has four attacks, and three of them can only be performed when
he has a sword. I'll list the attack which doesn't require a sword first. When the
Iron Giant raises his fist, retreat because he'll slam his fist down and cause a
huge eletrical malfunction thingy, causing you to take quite a bit of damage. Just
run off and cure if you're touched by it. Now the Giant needs a sword for these next
three. The first one is just a regular combo swipe. He'll go horizontally, then
vertically (or vice versa sometimes), and both can hit you and cause some damage.
For the second on, he'll simply slam his sword onto the ground.

This will cause a mini-shockwave to rise up. Hitting it does indeed damage you, so
back away when he raises his sword. The final attack is rare, but it does cause
MAJOR damage. The Iron Giant will swipe his sword once, which will cause a spinning
purple disc to come out. This is a large disc, so you'll want to run to the left or
right quickly to avoid being hit by it. You should have time to get in quite a few
swipes with your weapon before you're hit by the sword. When you are, just cure and
repeat the process. Taking out the two Goblins is your choice, since I personally
think that they aren't much of a bother. Eventually, you'll destroy one of the Iron
Giant's swords. The Giant will attack you a little bit without a sword, but he'll
then jump up to an area with another sword.

If no swords are left, then he'll simply attack you with his electric move. Just
keep running in, slashing, and then retreating to cure. This might take a little
while, but it's the safest way to go. If you wish, you can run in and slash away
until you get REALLY low health. This method is a lot quicker, but you'll still have
to heal. Besides, you'll need a Pheonix Down and high defense to survive all the
attacks.

--------------------
CYCLES TWO AND THREE
--------------------
Starting with cycle two, the Iron Giant will begin to cast a huge spell that looks
like the Milky Way Galaxy. This only happens when he does not have a sword. Make
sure to run away as far as possible to avoid getting hit by the attack.
*********************************************************************************

After you beat the Iron Giant, you'll get your Myrrh drop. Respond to the letter and
you'll then be asked (after you choose your artifact) which side of the Jegon River
you wish to travel to. You want to go to the East side, so choose that.

+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+

Head out of the Jegon River and onto the Iron Mine Downs. Head to Marr's Pass and
make any preparations you might need, then go back out and head to the Mushroom
Forest. Change your element to water, then return to the Jegon River. Sail over to
the west side for 50 gil and you'll arrive at the Plains of Fum. Make your way west
to the Miasma Stream, and cross it to enter the Rebena Plains. The Rebena Plains is
home to Conall Church and Rebena Te Ra, the next two dungeons that hold Myrrh for
you. It also holds the Holy Miasma Stream, where the Holy Element is required, which
you can't get until next year. This Miasma Stream takes you to the Abyss, which is
the source of all Miasma.

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Welcome to what might be the most frustrating, most confusing, and most difficult
dungeon yet (I'm still debating whether Daemon's Court is harder or not). This is
definitely the biggest dungeon, with many different paths you can take and over
twenty treasure chests, as well as a TON of enemies, most of them being quite
difficult. Although the name is "Conall Church," this area doesn't actually take
place inside a church. It takes place outside, in an old abandoned swamp where the
Selkies built weak bridges which you'll be crossing over most of the time. An
interesting thing about the bridges is that they can sink depending on how many
people are on them, but you only have to worry about that during multiplayer mode.

Main guide
~~~~~~~~~~

Head south at the beginning to enter Conall Church. After listening to the
narraration, which explains that Selkies worked their ass off to build bridges over
the swamp to find land (although they found no land... that really sucks), you'll
start the level. Go north and you'll be forced to fight some Snow Mu. You'll soon
discover that enemies as weak as the Snow Mu are pretty powerful, and you'll have to
work hard if you plan to survive. A Pheonix Down should always be in your command
list, so you can revive if necessary. Hug the right side as you go north and then
turn east. You'll enter an area with a Sahagin Lord and two Ice Bombs, as well as
one treasure chest. Open the chest for a Pheonix Down and defeat the three enemies
with Fire if you have it.

Continue heading north, and defeat the Magic Plants and Sahagin when they pop up.
You'll eventually come to a split in the path, one path going north and the other
path going west. Take the path west, since going north takes you to absolutely
nowhere. Continue to go west, defeating the enemies, and then head south when the
path turns south. At the end, you'll find a Magic Plant. Kill it and then you'll
find yourself in a big, wide-open area. Search around this area, defeating the Magic
Plants, Sahigains, and Thunder Bombs. There are four treasure chests to be found
here, three near the south part and one up north. Beware of the Sahigans that pop
out of the water, since they can surprise you and trap you with a bunch of different
enemies.

If you find yourself overwhelmed, use a magic attack that has a big radius. In the
very center of this area, you'll find some gravestones. Press B to read them.
However, in order to fully understand them, you have to be a Selkie. Gravestones
like these are found everywhere in the church, so look around. When you've defeated
all enemies and have collected the items from all four chests, head to the northwest
area and go north for a while to enter the second area. In area two, go north for a
little until you come to a split. Take the left path and follow it, defeating the
enemies as you go by. If you simply run away from the enemies, you'll find that when
you reach the end of the path, there will be a dead end and you'll be forced to deal
with about six or seven tough enemies.

After all enemeis are gone, you should have a lot of nice items for you to grab. Now
go back to the split and take the right path. Go north for a little while and you'll
come to another split. Take the left path here and go up the small bridge. Now, if
you did what I told you to do in Daemon's Court with the bridge, then some logs
should be here (if you don't know what I told you to do, go back to the Daemon's
Court guide and look for the part about the bridge). Cross them and follow the path
to find some more logs (again, you have to have blown up the bridge in the Court
twice in order to get these to appear). Now defeat the enemies and then you should
find a chest with a nice scroll. Now head north and get ready for one of the
toughest battles in the game.

No, this isn't a boss battle. It's a battle with four Stone Sahagins and one Sahagin
Lord. You'll need to focus on defeating the Stone Sahagins first, then the Sahagin
Lord. Pray that you have magic with a wide radius, and you'll really need the Cure
spell and some Pheonix Downs. This battle gets easier and easier as more people
play, but it is insane in single player. Good luck. The treasure chest at the end
contains a Soul of the Lion (First Cycle) or a Soul of the Dragon (Second and Third
Cycles) which are both rare materials, so the battle is worth it. Once it's over,
backtrack all the way to the most recent split you took and take the opposite path.
Go north, defeating the two Sahagins, and you'll come to a log raft. There is a
split in the path here.

Take the right path and you'll find a treasure chest at a dead end. Now head back to
the raft and take the north path. Follow this path, defeating the enemies, until you
come to a path heading south. Take it and you'll have to fight your way through a
bunch of enemies before finally reaching a big, open area. Defeat all the enemies
here then open the chest. Now go behind the tree and search around until you can
examine a small hole. Enter the hole to find the Moogle Nest. Collect your stamp and
then exit. Now backtrack all the way to the main bridge. Here, go a little east and
you'll come to a three-way split. Take the south path first, and open the chest
there. Then take the path east. Open the two chests when you get to them and head
north when you find a path.

Go west here, and stop when you get to an area with to Gigan Toads. Defeat them both
and then take the north path, where you'll find yourself in a wide open area with
two Sahigans. Defeat them and open the chest; collect the item and then go back
south to the area where the toads were. Go east now, and continue going east for a
while until you come to a treasure chest. Now go west and south, and continue going
south until you come to a split. Take the west part and head south and then west to
find a treasure chest. Now go east and you'll proceed to go south down a _LONG_
path. Keep going down the only path, defeating the enemies, until you come to a
grassy area. You'll then find, lo and behold, an Abaddon. These are giant bee
creatures which fly in the air and require Gravity if you wish to bring them down.

There are three of these giant beasts in this grassy area. When you defeat them all,
go north and you'll find a treasure chest containing either a Ring of Cure or a Star
Pendant, which are both great artifacts to have. Now backtrack all the way to the
split that you were at before. When you finall get there, head east for a while and
you'll enter the third and final area of Conall Church. In this area, go north just
a little bit to find hell (well, a nice little replica of it anyway). The Behemoths
that you fight here have a holy crap 72 HP and then you have to deal with Stone
Shagins OMGWTFLOL you're doomed. Really, this is TOUGH, so I suggest you get some
good magic to deal with the Behemoths. Any level three magic will take them out in
five or so hits, but if you don't have level three magic then you're in for a long
battle.

Okay, once you're done dealing with the Stone Sahagins and Behemoth, head north some
more. You'll find your first Ghost here. To make it vulnerable, you'll have to first
use Holy on it. Defeat the ghost, then head west and defeat another ghost. Right
below you is a treasure chests, so open it and go north. Go east when the path turns
and then head north a little more until you come to a split. Go west here and then
open the treasure chest. Now go back to the main bridge and go north then east.
Follow the path until you get to a big, open area. You're going to be spending quite
a bit of time at this area with all of the Behemoths (there are, I think, four) and
then the Dark Flans and the Stone Sahagins. Once you've finally (this is going to
take a while) killed all of the enemies, make sure you've collected the three
treasure chests before moving north to continue.

Here, defeat all the enemies and take the right path when you come to the split.
Open the chest and head west, then defeat the Stone Sahagin. Prepare some good
spells to use, and then head north to face the Dragon Zombie.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BOSS: Dragon Zombie
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Dragon Zombie is basically what it sounds like: a dead Dragon. The unique thing
about this dragon is that it can become transparent, therefore nearly completley
nullifying all attacks. The Dragon Zombie resists Slow, Stop, and Gravity, and
Blizzard and Thunder do moderate damage to it. Due to the intense length of this
dungeon, you should have Fiagra, Blizzaga, and Thundaga by now. Those all do
pratically no damage when the Dragon Zombie is invisible, but when its visible it
does a ****load of damage. Yeah. The best thing to have is Holy. Man, if you have
Holy than this boss just got a hell of a lot easier. Holy does the same amount of
damage to the Dragon Zombie when it's invisible that it does when it's visible (did
that make sense?).

Holy does a lot of damage no matter what form the Zombie is in, and whenever the
Zombie is invisible, using Holy will instantly make it visible. Now, the Dragon
Zombie has four good attacks that can piss you off and take away a lot of hearts.
The first attack is the most common one, a poison breath that takes up about 5/6 of
the platform you're on. When you see the Dragon Zombie inhale green air, run to the
opposite side of the platform and stay there to avoid suffering major damage and
being poisoned at the same time. Simply cast your spells from that corner until the
Zombie stops exhaling the poison gas. The second attack is a whirling tornado that
the Zombie likes to shoot straight out at you. If you simply move left or right, you
won't be touched.

The third attack is a laser that is shot straight out. If it hits you, you'll suffer
no damage. However, you'll be petrified, which will cause you to take double damage.
If you get hit by the laser, wiggle the controls stick back and forth to make
yourself be able to move again. The final attack is rare, and it doesn't do that
much damage. The Dragon Zombie will simply shake his head from side to side. If this
hits you, you'll be knocked back and any spell you were charging up will be
cancelled. Also, Stone Sahagins will come occasionally; take them out the moment you
see them or the battle will get quite difficult. Now, like I said earlier, Holy is
the most efficient attack to use. Just use it ad nauseam from one spot (but make
sure to switch spots occasionally so you aren't hit!) and the Dragon Zombie's HP
will slowly deplete.

It might be a good idea to come equipped with a Phoenix Down, since you might die
your first time through this boss.

--------------------
CYCLES TWO AND THREE
--------------------
Like the Cave Worm, the Dragon Zombies attack and defense stats will increase,
making the battle much more difficult. Holy is ABSOLUTELY necessary here, as well as
Cure and a Phoenix Down. If you're playing multiplayer, then you can create Holyra,
which is a more powerful version of Holy. Use it to down the Dragon quicker. Also
note that Stone Sagahins appear more often, so you'll have to deal with lots of them
too.
*********************************************************************************

You'll get your second drop of Myrrh for year four. Only three dungeons remain in
the game (as well as a little side-quest that I'll list later)! Okay, let me note
that this dungeon had the Cure Ring in one of its treasure chests. You can also get
it from the boss in sets two, four, and six. Choose the Cure Ring when you see it,
then go through the whole Conall Church again and grab the Star Pendant. Cure is
going to become scarce in the reamining dungeons, so you'll need it with you from
the start. The Star Pendant increases your health, so you'll have seven hearts,
which is always a good thing. You can head to Rebena Te Ra right now if you want, so
do so.

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Welcome, welcome to the most confusing labyrinth of switches, chests, and enemies.
There are thirteen different types of enemies here, all of which are pretty
powerful. Ghosts and Wraiths like to fly around here, and they're undead, so make
sure you have the Holy spell with you at all times. There is also a new type of
switch here, as well as two of the most challenging puzzles in the game. It's going
to take a lot to get through this level.

Main guide
~~~~~~~~~~

Go north twice from Conall Church and you'll stoop in front of Rebena Te Ra. Go
north once more to enter it. Listen to the narraratioin, which explains that the
four tribes lived together before miasma and monsters. This really doesn't have to
do with anything in here, except for they might have lived in that big pyramid over
there. Okay, this dungeon introduces Mimics, those annoying little fake treasure
chests. Usually, if there are two close treasure chests, one's a Mimic. When you
strike it, it'll split into three parts and fly around madly. Use physical attacks
to take it out. Now go east and defeat the Skeleton, then you'll find another pair
of treasure chests. Again, one is a Mimic. Take it out and open the other chest,
then go north and defeat the skeletons.

There is a Ghost here, so you hopefully have Life. Fuse it with one of your Rings to
make Holy and defeat the ghost. Continue north up the stairs and defeat the
skeletons here. Use Holy to make the Nightmare vulnerable and then defeat it. Now
return to the start of the level. Head west, and then defeat the Skeletons when the
come close to you. Then open the chests, grab the item, and defeat the Mimic. Now go
north, down the stairs. Hello, and welcome to the Courtyard Maze, have fun trying to
find your way through. No, really, the easiest path through is west all the way,
then north all the way. Defeat the Vampire Bat and it'll drop a key. Now DON'T USE
THIS KEY ON THE PEDESTAL NEAR YOU. Pick it up, and backtrack all the way to the
start of the level. When you get there, head east and then north to the area you
first went to.

You'll find a pedestal there. With all the enemies gone, it's no problem walking up
to the pedestal and placing the key in. This will open a door. Head west, then south
for a while until you find an area with a treasure chest and a key. Now you may be
asking yourself, "Why did I just do that?" Well, placing the key in the first
pedestal would make it so you wouldn't be able to access the area that you're
currently in at all. So once you have the artifact, pick up the key that is lying
next to it and go all the way back to the first pedestal. Place the key in that slot
to open the door. Now you'll find a glowing blue laser blocking your path to
progress. You'll also find two circular switches. Place the chalice on one of them
and check to see if you have full health. You'll have to run out into the miasma to
step on the other one.

Wait until both switches glow red, then the laser will disappear. Once the laser is
gone, head through and grab the item from one treasure chest and defeat the Mimic in
the second treasure chest. Climbing the stairs to the left only takes you to a
Nightmare and a Skeleton, so ignore them unless you care about the two items.
Instead, go west and south, following the path. A Gargoyle will spring, and you'll
have to defeat it. Do so and then head north into the next area. Here, you'll find a
new type of switch: the Magic Switch. Locked doors populate the areas around the
switches, and to open the doors you'll need to hit the switch with a certain type of
magicite, then run forward and slash it with your weapon. The red switches require
you to use Fire, the blue switches require you to use Blizzard, the purple switches
require you to use Thunder, and the clear switch lets you use any type of magicite.

The first switch you'll see is blue. Before you activate it, run to the left and you
should spot a treasure chest. You'll notice a Gargoyle left of the switch so kill it
to makme your life easier. Now go through the door you just opened and defeat the
enemy. Cast fire on the switch and hit it with your weapon to open the door. In the
next area, defeat the Wraith, Skeleton, and Cerberus. Now open the chest and then
ask yourself this: How many people are currently playing with you? If the answer is
two, three, or four then the next puzzle will be extremely easy. If you're playing
alone, you're going to have the BEST time opening the door in front of you. This
door is being blocked by a Blizzard and Fire switch, and you have to hit both
simoltaneously and then run forward and slash them both quickly for you to complete
the puzzle.

First, drop the chalice so that both switches are inside the protective force field,
but the chalice is close to the fire switch than it is to the blizzard switch. Now,
you should notice a Gargoyle on the other side of the area. Position yourself in an
area where that Gargoyle can hit you. Let him hit you for a while until Mog says,
"Hang in there, kupo!" This means he's about to cast a spell. Leave your position
and go in between the two switches. Now switch to Fire or Blizzard. If you have
Fire, move your cursor over to the Blizzard switch. If you have Blizzard, move it
over to the Fire switch. DON'T release the spell power yet. Mog should charge up a
spell and place it over your cursor, which should be on the switch opposite your
current magic. Wait until Mog casts his spell. He'll cast a random spell, so pray
that it is either Fire or Blizzard (depending on what switch he's casting it on).

If he does cast Fire/Blizzard on the correct switch, quickly move your cursor over
to the opposite switch and cast your spell. Now switch to your regular weapon and
rush over to the first switch and slash it, then do the same to the second switch.
The barrier should _FINALLY_ go away. Now heal yourself, defeat the Gargoyle, and
pat yourself on the back for that hard work. Go past the barrier you just opened and
defeat all the enemies, then open the chest. You should now find a laser with no
switch in sight, except for one on the other side. Fear not, for you do not have to
hit this switch with a physical strike! Cast any type of magic to lower the barrier,
then head through and defeat the Gargyole and skeleton. Head on through to find a
Wraith and four treasure chests.

Three of the chests are Mimics. Defeat all the Mimics and open the final chest to
find a scroll for either Diamond Armor, Holy Armor, Holy Shield, Pure Armor, or a
Pure Belt. Now return to the area with Hell's Puzzle. To the left of it is a simple
Thunder switch. Open the door using Thunder and then defeat the Cerberus but
___NOT___ the Skeleton Mage! If you accidentaly do defeat the Mage, exit and re-
enter the AREA (not the actual dungeon) and it'll re-appear. Anyway, stand on the
switch here and let the Skeleton Mage strike you with a thunder spell. If you take
thunder damage while standing on this switch, the door will open. Now go north,
east, and south, then up the stairs to find four more switches and another Skeleton
Mage. This Mage is able to cast all three types of magic.

Take damage from all the spells while standing on the switches, and when you have
taken proper damage for each switch the door will open. Now you should see a
treasure chest in a little closed off area. There's a hole in the north part of this
closed off area, so go through and grab the item in the chest. Now head out and go
south to find two magic switches. Take fire damage on the right switch and blizzard
damage on the left switch to open the door. DON'T go thorugh the door you just
opened; instead, head north through the door you opened with four switches. Defeat
the two skeletons and then you'll see an area with two switches. Here's your next
puzzle, and it gets tough at the end. First, step on the switch on your left. This
will lower the wall.

Get on the lowered wall and step on the right switch. The wall will rise. Step on
the right switch that's on the next section of the wall to lower another section. On
this new section, drop the Chalice and place it on the right switch, then quickly
rush back to the previous section of the wall. Step on the right switch, then
IMMIDIATELY step on the left switch on the first section of the wall. When you're on
the ground, head around to the right and get on the section of the wall before it
rises once more. Once it does rise (and you're on it), make sure you're copmletely
cured. Head out into the miasma and you'll find a key. Quickly PUSH it into the
protective force field, then pick it up and get onto the little ledge sticking out
of the wall.

You can jump off the wall here, so do so. Now retrieve the crystal chalice, and you
should notice that part of the wall has lowered, allowing you to access a new area.
Get back onto the ground and go into that new area. You'll have to drop the key to
defeat the two Skeleton Mages and the Wraith. When they're gone, open the chest and
grab the item, then pick up the key again. Backtrack all the way to Hell's Puzzle
(the two switch puzzle). On the way back to Hell's Puzzle, you should pass a
pedestal. Place the key in the pedestal to open the door. Head east right when you
go through. You'll find a hole. Walk up to it and examine to open a small door,
which is the entrance to the Moogle Nest. Get your stamp and then exit the Moogle
Nest.

Go up the small steps and head to the northern part to find a treasure chest. Open
it and then return to the door that you opened with the two damaging switches (not
the Magic Switches). Go south there, past the two Gargoyles, and into the next area.
Here, defeat the Gargoyle and the Nightmare. Head south and then go across the
STONES (not down the steps). Go south down these stones to get onto the actual
pyramid. Near the bottom of this are some steps. Head up and step on the switch here
to open the door near the bottom of the pyramid. Now go down the other set of steps
and head north. Activate the Clear Magic Switch when you see it, and continue north
to find a chest. Open the chest and then return to the beginning of this area. Head
down the steps and step on the switch.

This will lower a barrier. Go past the part where the barrier was and you'll be in
the first area. Backtrack all the way to the entrance of the dungeon, and head north
from there to enter the pyramid. Make sure you are at full health and are capable of
casting Gravity and Holy, then enter the pyramid to face the Lich.

~~~~~~~~~~
BOSS: Lich
~~~~~~~~~~
At the start, Lich will activate two switches, which will make a protectice sphere
around it. It is invulnerable to every attack (even Holy) as long as that sphere
surrounds it. First, take out the Skeleton in your way and then head to the east
side. Cast Fire, Blizzard, or Thunder magic on the switch (I used Thunder) and then
do the same to the other switch. This will lower the sphere, and you won't have to
worry about it for the rest of the battle. First things first, CAST GRAIVTY!!! I
cannot stress this enough! Cast Gravity on the Lich and watch what is easily a third
of the Lich's health bar disappear. If you try to cast Gravity agian, this trick
won't work, so you don't need it after it's used once. The Lich is like the Dragon
Zombie because it is transparent sometimes and becomes solid other times.

The only thing you'll want to use (after you use Gravity, of course) is Holy. Holy
does some MASSIVE damage, whether the Lich is invisible or visible. Now, the Lich
has three attacks, two of which are quite common and one that is rare. The first
attack is the most common. The Lich will make a glowing blue halo appear. When that
happens, run FAR away! After a couple of seconds, an electrical storm will occur,
and it has a freaking HUGE raidius. If you're hit, you'll lose a bunch of hearts for
every electric ball that hits you (there's four or five eletric balls total) and
you'll be paralyzed briefly. The second attack is a giant rock that the Lich will
call upon if you get close to it. A spot of white light will shine and the rock will
follow quickly after the rock.

It is very hard to avoid, but it thankfully is one of the weaker attacks the Lich
has. The final attack is rare, and it may not happen at all in the battle. The Lich
will start to charge up a purple and black sphere. When this happens, move away from
it. After a while, a spell will be released and cause some huge damage if you're
hit. Physical attacks aren't really a good idea for this battle. Also, the Lich
resists Fire, Blizzard, Thunder, Slow, and Stop. After you cast Gravity once, it'll
resist that as well. Holy is the only thing that can really damage the Lich, and
it's the only spell I suggest you use.

--------------------
CYCLES TWO AND THREE
--------------------
A new attack is added to the Lich's move set starting with cycle two. The Lich will
send out two yellow shockwaves. If you're hit, you won't be damaged, but youll be
knocked down. This is an opportunity for the Lich to use many attacks on you, so try
to avoid the attack as best you can.
*********************************************************************************

Once the Lich is finally down, the final drop of Myrrh for year four will come down.
Watch the celebration and read your diary, and you'll begin year five, the year
where you can at last rid the world of miasma forever. Talk to your family to get a
good item, and then head out into the Tipa Peninsula.

+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+

What? The Jegon River has dried, which means no travelling to the Plains of Fum or
Rebena Fields, as well as the Kilanda Islands, from the Jegon River boat. But
there's another boat that is now available to you, accessed from Port Tipa. So head
to Port Tipa and go to the beach. Go down the dock to find Tristan, who will say he
can still take you to the Kilanda Islands and Leuda. Going to the Plains of Fum,
however, is out of the question :( When you get to Lynari Isle, you'll automatically
enter Leuda.

+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+
|                                 Leuda                             Y502      |
+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+

Leuda contains a bunch of different Selkies. There is a Moogle Nest, a secret item,
two shops, and a fun mini-game to play if you're a Selkie. First, let me issue a
warning:

UNLESS YOU'RE A SELKIE OR UNLESS YOU HAVE LESS THAN 100 GIL ___DON'T___ TALK TO ANY
SELKIES HERE!

If you do, they'll steal 1-10 gil from you. Yeah, it isn't much, but if you keep
talking and talking you can lose a lot. Okay, let's start on the tour. Your first
pedestrian is here, so don't talk to him. All he says is, "This is no place for
outsiders!" Anyway, examine the area next to the tent to find a secret item. Yay.
Cross the bridge here to find a bunch of Selkie kids talking and one jumping. It's
safe to talk to the kids. If you're a Selkie, you can play a mini-game that involves
jumping. What you need to do is press the buttons that the screen tells you to, in
the correct order. You'll get points depending on what combinations you press. You
can roll left or right using the control stick to roll. The points you're awarded
are doubled when you roll.

Don't fall or you'll have to start over. It can be _REALLY_ tough when you are
starting out, but you'll get better and better at it. Here's the amount of points
you can get for each jump:

-------------------------------
Button combination   | Points |
-------------------------------
A/B                  | 1      |
-------------------------------
A,A/B,B              | 2      |
-------------------------------
A,B/B,A              | 3      |
-------------------------------
A,A,B/B,B,A          | 4      |
-------------------------------
A,B,B,A/B,A,A,B      | 5      |
-------------------------------
A,B,A,B,A/B,A,B,A,B  | 6      |
-------------------------------

There are prizes you can win if you get a ****load of points. It's going to take
LOTS of practice to be able to get these prizes though.

---------------------
Points | Prize      |
---------------------
500+   | Bronze     |
---------------------
1000+  | Iron       |
---------------------
2000+  | Mythril    |
---------------------
4000+  | Orichalcum |
---------------------

Have fun trying to get 4000 points. I can barely get 2000, although I once got lucky
and got 4000...

Okay, head east, up the small hill and talk to the Selkie there. She'll ask what you
want with her. Talk to her a second time and she'll offer to sell you some stuff.
This is what she sells:

+-----------------------------+
|     MERCHANT SALESMAN       |
+-----------------------------+
|Bronze...............300 gil |
|Iron.................500 gil |
|Mythril..............5000 gil|
|Crystal Ball.........100 gil |
|Ruby.................200 gil |
|Jade.................200 gil |
|Alloy................250 gil |
+-----------------------------+

Buy some materials if you want and continue up the path. You should find another man
here. Talk to him twice and he'll show you what scrolls he has.

+-----------------------------+
|     MERCHANT SALESMAN       |
+-----------------------------+
|          Scrolls            |
+-----------------------------+
|Valiant Weapon.......500 gil |
|Mighty Weapon........500 gil |
|Victorious Weapon....500 gil |
|Mythril Armor........300 gil |
|Mythril Shield.......250 gil |
|Mythril Gloves.......250 gil |
|Mythril Sallet.......250 gil |
|Mythril Belt.........250 gil |
+-----------------------------+

Continue west, down the path. You should find a pink tent at the end. Slip behind it
and go up a small hill to find a door. Go through to enter the Moogle Nest. While
you're here, CUT MOG'S HAIR! Lynari Desert is EXTREMELY hot, so you'll want it as
short as possible. Once you've cut his hair, exit the nest and head east, passing
the merchant, until you exit the World Map.

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lynari Desert is home to THE hardest puzzle in the whole game, and you're given
hints on how to do it through Gurdy's story scenes (read his poems). The reward for
completing the puzzle is the Holy Crystal Chalice Element, which allows you to pass
through any Miasma Stream and is required to get through the final Miasma Stream. It
is also a big, confusing area that is very hot, so you may want to trim Mog's hair
before entering. It's easy to get lost in, because you're in the middle of the
desert, after all! :)

Main guide
~~~~~~~~~~

Go north from Leuda to enter Lynari Desert. Listen to the narraration, and you'll
hear about a man that set out to find treasure in Lynari Desert. The narrarations
just get weirder and weirder, don't they? At the start, head north for a while and
hug the left side. Keep hugging the wall, even as it starts curving west.
Eventually, it'll curve completely south. Go south and hug the right wall, and
you'll come to a dead end with a treasure chest. Open the chest, then backtrack a
little to find a path going even further south. Take it and follow the sand,
defeating the enemies. At the end, you'll see two green bags. Destroy them with your
weapon and head through to be blocked by a treasure chest. Open it and grab the
item, then move around in the little alcove until the examine icon pops up.

Examine the area and enter the Moogle Nest. Get your stamp and then exit. Return
back to the area where the path first turned to the south. From here, go north and
hug the left wall. You should eventually come to a group of two catuces, the left
one being a little bigger than the right one. Cast Thunder on the big one and a
brief cut-scene will occur. Once it's over, you'll want to hug the left wall for a
LONG time, turning whenever it turns. Eventually, you'll reach an old tent. Cast
Gravity on it to trigger another small cut-scene. Head south now, past the two
waterfalls of sand. You should encounter a Zu, so defeat it and continue south,
hugging the right wall. Eventually, the examine icon will pop up, and pressing it
will show you a big rock that looks like a mushroom.

Cast Fire on that mushroom rock and another cut-scene will occur. Now head back all
the way to the area with the cactus that you cast Thunder on. From there, go a tiny
bit southeast to find three rocks of different sizes. Cast Blizzard on the smallest
rock, then cast it on the middle-sized rock, then finally the big rock. Now head
south for a bit, and after you do that hug the left wall and head south some more.
Eventually, you'll come to a clear, pink flower. Cast Holy on it, and if you can't
use Holy, then get a Life spell and return to this area. Once you cast Holy, it'll
become a Hot Spot of the Holy Element. This element allows you to pass through any
miasma stream, no matter what element. So NEVER change your chalice element again
now.

By the way, the reason we did all of those magic spells is because the flower
wouldn't have appeared otherwise. Once you have the Holy Element, return to the area
where you lit the mushroom on fire. Look for a quicksand pit near here and jump in
to be warped to the next area. Head north and defeat the enemies, and stop when you
reach a split path. Take the left path and go northwest and defeat the Scorpion,
Lamia, and Chimera. There is another split here. Take the left path first and you'll
encounter a dead end. Open the chest there and then go back to the first split. Take
the right path, and head south when you have the option of going north or south.
There's a green plant here; slash it to reveal an item. Grab it and head north for a
while until you encounter a bunch of green plants.

Defeat all the Cactuar, Lamias, and the Chimera. Use a powerful level three spell to
damage them; Thundaga works best because of its paralysis powers. Head west from the
green plants and you'll encounter a split. Take the lower path and go south when you
can. Open the chest, then go north and west to find more green plants. Slash them
and then go south to find a single plant. Slash it to find an artifact. Now head
north, left, and north when you get the chance. Slash the plants and continue north,
defeating all the enemies, until you enter the next area. Here, you'll see the boss
arena right next to you. Go all the way around the outer edge, IGNORING the path
going south. Keep going around the edge until you enter another area here. Go south
and defeat the Lamias.

At the end is a green plant. Hitting it MAY reveal a Cactus Flower, which gives you
a discount on ferry rides. However, it'll sometimes reveal nothing at all. Once you
have slashed the plant, return to the previous area and go down the southern path
you ignored. Make sure to have strong spells, and you'll enter the area with the
Antlion. Here, you have to defeat a bunch of enemies. The more enemies you defeat,
the more the sand will lower. Once you've defeated enough enemies, the Antlion will
appear.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BOSS: Antlion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Augh, another difficult boss battle. Like pretty much all other bosses in Final
Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles, the Antlion is a traditional Final Fantasy enemy that
has now been supersized. Literally. The Antlion has some weaknesses, but don't
bother using Thunder, Slow, or Stop on it. Fire and Holy are okay, Blizzard is good,
and Gravity is the best, though once you've used Graivty once, it won't damage the
Antlion again. Start off by using Gravity to sap away a huge amount of HP (not as
much as the Lich, but it's still a lot). After that, switch to Blizzaga (you
should've gotten a hundred Blizzard Stones in the dungeon) and start to use it. The
Antlion has four tough attacks that all sap a really big amount of health, so you'll
want to make sure you have at least eight hearts for the battle.

The first attack is the most common, and happens only when you're facing the
Antlion's face. It'll snap its pinchers and knock you back, as well as taking away
what is easily three or more hearts. NEVER face the front of it; always make sure
you're at the sides of the Antlion or behind the Antlion and you'll be pretty safe.
The next attack doesn't damage you, but it can petrify. The Antlion will inahle some
wind, then exhale a bunch of sand. It faces only one direction when doing this, so
use this attack to your advantage by charging and casting Blizzaga. The third attack
is rare, but it'll happen a few times in the battle. The Antlion will send its
pinchers down to the ground and release a huge shockwave that surrounds it. If
you're close to the Antlion, you'll suffer serious damage when this attack is used.

The final attack happens only when the Antlion's HP gets low. It'll shoot two blue
lasers in front of it, which can cause some heavy damage. If you move to the sides,
you'll avoid it. Also, regular Scorpions will pop out of the ground and stab you
with their pinchers. This poisons your character, which can get REALLY annoying.
Casting Blizzaga on the Antlion should also hit and freeze the Scorpion. Two
Blizzaga attacks will finish off a Scorpion, and it'll be a while before another one
appears again. Make sure to run out of harm's way when curing yourself, and NEVER
stand in front. NEVER. You're a lot safer if you're facing the side or the back. You
have been warned.

--------------------
CYCLES TWO AND THREE
--------------------
The attack, defense, and speed of the Antlion will increase during the second cycle,
and it'll increase even more during the third cycle. Also, more and more Scorpions
will start to appear, which can cause some major distractions. Make sure you have
high magic, so Blizzaga can still do a good amount of damage.
*********************************************************************************

You'll get a drop of Myrrh, although you aren't going to get three drops of Myrrh
for year five (you're only getting two, then heading to the Abyss to rid the world
of the miasma forever).

+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+
|                              Rebena Te Ra                         Y503      |
+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+

Once you have chosen your artifact for Lynari Desert, you'll want to head to the
Abyss. However, the Jegon River has dried up, so you can't get to the Plains of Fum.
If you can't get to the Plains of Fum, you can't get to Rebena Plains. If you can't
get to Rebena Plains, you can't reach the Abyss. So you now have a choice of what to
do. You can either head to Veo Lu Sluice and bring the flowers back to life, or you
can finish year five with three drops of Myrrh, then go and collect six more Myrrh
drops to get to year eight. Once year eight has begun, the Jegon River will fill
again. However, if you have the Holy Element for your chalice, there's a MUCH
quicker way to refill the river.

First, exit Lynari Isle by means of the ferry in Leuda. Go to Port Tipa. Here,
travel into the Miasma Stream. You should have the Holy Element, so you should be
able to go through. Head through the Miasma Stream in the Iron Mine Downs, and then
through the one in the Vale of Alfitaria. In Veo Lu, go to the Veo Lu Sluice.

+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+
|                            Refilling River                        Y504      |
+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+

Back in Veo Lu Sluice, you should notice that all river areas have now dried up,
giving you access to eight more treasure chests. These chests contain rare
artifacts, so make sure to go through them all. Now, there are six special
"Pumpflower Plants" in this area. Using Life on one of these plants will refill a
part of the Jegon River. If you use Life on all six of the plants, then Jegon River
will be totally filled again, and you won't have to worry about it drying up again
for the rest of the game. I'm only going to be telling you where the Pumpflower
Plants are, since you should already know your way around this area. You should know
the locations of previous lakes, so I'm not going to go too in-depth on where to
find dried up lakes.

Finally, please note that this is now cycle two, and that the enemies are stronger
and the artifacts are more rare. Okay, go south at the start into the next area.
Here, head up north and the west. Go down into the dry lake and open the chests,
then cast life on the big plant here. Head back out and go west all the way. Go
south here to find a switch. Remember the key puzzles, where the water spouts rose
to give you the keys when you stepped on the switches? You do? Good. First things
first, you should notice a dead plant next to the switch. Cast Life to revive it.
Now make the key emerge from the water spout and then take it down south and then
east to the pedestal. Go south and then go down the stairs into the dried up lake.
Collect the item from the chest and then head to the right side.

There's a plant here, so revive it with Life. Go back up the stairs and head west.
There's a pedestal here. Head south a little and look to your left to find a plant.
Revive it with Life. Now ignore the key puzzle and go south then west all the way.
Defeat the huge group of enemies, then go west to the end. There's another plant
here, so revive it. Now use the switch to get the key and place it in the nearest
pedestal. Hug the left wall as you go north to find another flower. Revive it and
you'll have revived all six flowers. Now step on the close switch and get the final
key, then place it in the pedestal. Head through and defeat the boss to get another
Myrrh drop (although it's not really needed). The Jegon River is now filled. Yay.
*********************************************************************************

This is just a suggestion, but if you're curious to see the final part of the Black
Night's story, go ahead and collect another drop of Myrrh. That will be your
sixteenth, and you'll then see the Black Knight's ending, which is extremely sad.
Why? Just watch and find out...

+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+
|                               The Abyss                          Y505       |
+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+

Go to Rebena Plains and enter the Miasma Stream there. There's no set element; you
MUST have the Holy Element to pass through. You'll see a strange creature here... a
Carbuncle. Follow it into the Abyss, the source of all miasma...

And home to the beast Raem.

+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+
|                                Mag Mell                           Y506      |
+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+

The last word of the boy who set off to destroy the miasma was heard from Mag
Mell... the only "town" in the Abyss. There are many different cocoons here, and
there is only one that actually talks. All of them have the strange Carbuncles
inside. This place is also home to a Moogle Nest, but that's it. It's a huge place,
but those are the only two attractions. Head west at the start and then go east.
Walk around behind the big cocoon until the examine icon pops up. You'll find a
small hole which is home to a lovely Moogle. Collect your stamp then head back to
the start of the town. Go north all the way, and then northwest when you can't go
north anymore. You'll find the talking Carbuncle here. At first, it'll just pretend
to sleep.

Visit it next year and it'll talk to you. Visit it four years in a row after that
and you'll hear everything it will say to you. That's really the only attraction
here, so head back out of Mag Mell for now.

Main Guide
~~~~~~~~~~

NOTE: Before you enter Mount Vellenge, go back and select your diary and (I'm not
kidding) re-read the whole thing. You'll probably have 60+ pages, but READ IT ALL!
Trust me, the information in it will be REALLY useful near the very end of the game.

Mount Vellenge... the meteor is located in here, the meteor that spread the miasma.
The boss here, the Meteor Parasite, is the actual source of the miasma. But there's
more. What is there? Let's just say you need strong memories...

The narraration is just the narrarator writing a letter to her mother, and explains
nothing about where she is or any info on Mount Vellenge. You have a tough fight
ahead of you, so make sure you have a Phoenix Down and a Cure Ring handy, as well as
some other rings just in case. Strong stats are needed too, and if you want to
survive the final boss battle, you'll need many memories. Two Chimeras come charging
at you the very beginning of the level. They can take you out instantly if your
stats are not strong. You may have to go through many, many other dungeons to build
your stats so you can finally challenge Mount Vellenge. Okay, head south right at
the start to find a HUGE boulder blocking your path. There are approximately eleven
of these boulders in Mount Vellenge.

They take six hits from a weapon to destroy, and magic doesn't affect them. Destroy
this boulder and head on through. Go east all the way until you can go east no more.
At this point, go northwest and defeat the Chimera and open the chest. By the way,
out of the fourteen chests found in this level, there are only thirteen artifacts to
be given; no scrolls or materials here, and enemies don't drop any artifacts. After
I describe how to get the first four chests, I'm going to stop telling you where to
find chests, since you can only hold four artifacts anyway. Now, when you went all
the way east you passed a path going south. Take that path south and open the
treasure chest here. You'll also find a holy crap it's a 48 HP Death Knight. These
guys are TOUGH.

They have strong defense, as well as the fact that their attacks do major damage and
have SUPER long range. Defeat this guy and then head west to find another boulder.
Smash it and then head down to find a Sphere. Use Gravity to bring it down and then
defeat it. Ignore the rock for now and head south. You'll spot a Death Knight, a
Shade, and a treasure chest. Open the chest and use powerful attacks to defeat the
Death Knight and Shade. Return to the boulder you saw and break it, then go south,
past the boulder, into a big blue, wide open area. There's a ****load of enemies
here. If I were you, I'd simply ignore them and run southwest as fast as I can.
You'll encounter a boulder which you should break quickly. There's no turning back
now, since about five enemies are blocking your way.

Rush down south past the boulder you just broke, into area two. Here, heal yourself
instantly and equip a Phoenix Down, for you're about to encounter THE most annoying
obstacle you'll ever encounter in the game: the Miasma Crystal. As you head south, a
whir sound will play, and it'll slowly get louder and louder. STOP once a purple
crystal appears in your sight. If you have a focus attack that has long range, stay
as far away from the purple crystal as you can and shoot it with focus attacks. You
may be asking yourself, "What's so bad about this crystal?" Well, if you get closer,
your Crystal Chalice will suddenly dull and the force field will be cancelled. This
leaves you completely vulnerable to miasma. These Miasma Crystal are like the
boulders.

They have to be hit six times with a weapon and they'll break. Magic won't work. In
multiplayer, it isn't any easier. They have to be hit six times from the same person
and they'll break. So make one person the healer, and have them heal while the other
breaks the crystal. If you have three or four people playing, have the last two deal
with the monsters. Continue south  and rush past the Tentacle and Shade; they're too
much trouble for you to deal with them. The Shade will probably follow you, but just
defeat it. The Tentacle will remain in one place. As you proceed further down the
path, you'll hear another whir of a Miasma Crystal. A Tonberry guards this crystal.
Just because the Tonberry Chefs in Mochet Manor were easy, don't expect these guys
to be that simple.

They have 24 HP and their infamous Knife attack can reallly hurt you. Defeat it from
a far range and then heal yourself and quickly shatter the Miasma Crystal. Open the
chest to collect your fourth artifact for the level. Go east, and rush past the
tentacle. Continue east and you'll pass under a bridge. Stay under this bridge and
examine the right wall to find a hole. What the hell is a moogle doing in a place as
scary as this? Collect your stamp and then exit. NOTE: If you have a GBA, and a GBA
cable, paint your moogle green. Why? I'll explain later. Continue southwest down the
path. Shatter the crystal near the treasure chest and go east. Now, if you don't
have a long-range focus attack or a powerful magic spell, shattering the next Miasma
Crystal will be hell.

The two Tentacles here cast Slowga on you, and they're guarding the Miasma Crystal.
You might want to defeat both of them from a long range while your chalice is still
active with the force field. Once they're gone, quickly breack the cyrstal. Now heal
yourself and ready yourself with powerful, powerful spells and make sure you're at
full health. Run southeast for a while and you'll enter the boss arena.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BOSS (Form 1): Meteor Parasite
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Well, here you are... the final battle with the Meteor Parasite. It's essential that
you have these status:

Strength: 55+
Defense: 65+
Magic: 40+
Memories: 80+

You might have to go through a few additional years (I had to go through four more
years before my status were like that) to get your status up to that level. Along
with that you'll need to have Fira/Firaga, Blizzara/Blizzaga, Cure, Clear, and a
couple of Phoenix Downs ready. Now, the Meteor Parasite looks huge and it is, but
the actual vulnerable spot is a small tentacle swinging around everywhere. This
tentacle causes massive damage if your defense isn't high, and it has a couple of
magical attacks that can hurt you, but those come in parts two and three. Even if
you have the status listed above, you still may not be able to beat it. A lot of
this battle required you to actually be skilled when it comes to playing the game.
Oh no, not that!

Really, if you got through the game only because of high status, you're in major
trouble here. Now, the Meteor Parasite has only two attacks in the first form, and
both are very annoying. The first attack is a poison spell. The spell can reach you
no matter where you are, and you have a couple of seconds to move out of the way
before it's cast. It has a medium raidus, so you won't have to move far. The second
attack happens only when you're close enough to the Meteor Parasite. It'll smash
down where you are and cause SERIOUS damage, unless you have high defense, where
it'll take away only a heart or so. The spinning larva-type things surrounding the
actual meteor can poison you if you walk up and touch them, so never get TOO close
to the Paraiste.

Only get close enough to where you can slash with your weapon. A long range focus
attack is great, although the charging up may mess you up. Level three magic
(Firaga, Blizzaga, and Thundaga) is recommended ONLY for part one of this battle,
which is the part we're focusing on now. Slow, Stop, Gravity, and yes even Holy have
no effect on the Meteor Parasite. Okay, the Parasite is hard enough, but something
that nearly doubles the difficulty is the fact that two tentacles always rest on
each side of the arena. They will spit poison/ice (the left tentacle) or fire (the
right tentacle. Ignoring these tentacles pretty much guarantees that you'll suffer
an instant death (believe me, they hurt, and the attacks of the Meteor Paraiste
don't help).

I HIGHLY suggest you don't take out both Tentacles though; it only takes about sixty
seconds for one to respawn, and it takes a long time just killing one; instead,
equip Blizzara and head for the one on the right. It takes about six hits with
Blizzara to defeat it, and if Blizzara keeps freezing it, it can't attack. Once it's
gone, rush to the Meteor Paraiste and use magic or weapons, depending on which is
stronger. If you have a GBA with a green moogle, like I told you to do, it should
show how much each thing does. Usually, both magic and weapons will only do one
point of damage each (and it has 450 HP!), but that will have to do. Once the
Tentacle on the right respawns, heal, use Clear, and defeat the Tentacle once more.
Then continue attacking the Meteor Parasite.

Lather, rinse, repeat. It's a slow process, but the safest one (I didn't even have
to use one Phoenix Down using this strategy). Ignore the Tentacle on the left
completely (it shouldn't be too much of a bother). NEVER attack the Parasite when
both Tentacles are on the screen because, like I said earlier, you'll be eliminated
quickly. Once you inflict 150 points of damage, it'll transform...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BOSS (Form 2): Meteor Parasite
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You are now in a lower level of the boss arena, where the area is bigger, allowing
you to move around more. Also, the two Tentacles on both sides of the boss are
farther apear, allowing you to easily avoid one while dealing with the other.
However, the Meteor Parasite has trashed the two attacks it had in Form One and
replaced it with a deadly attack that shall be known as Hell's Little Pink Circle of
Death (TM). It also has a second attack that is used rarely, only a couple of times
in the whole battle. HLPCoD is one attack that is as strong, maybe stronger, then
the Meteor Parasite's body slam. However, it can hit you no matter where you're
standing. The Meteor Parasite will throw itself upward a little and a small sound
will be made (you'll grow to recognize it).

A pink circle will appear wherever you're standing. When this appears, RUN! It has a
medium radius, and causes and explosion only about a second after it appears. This
can do a lot of damage if your defense isn't high. You can't block this spell, and
it interrupts any magic you're charging, as well as knocking you down or
interrupting a 1-2-3 Combo Attack. Make sure that you aren't hit at all by that
attack (you will get hit a couple times in the battle, but try to keep the hits to
the minimum). The second attack is very easy to avoid, and very deadly if you're
hit. You may have noticed in the first form that the Meteor Parasite retreated into
the actual Meteor area a few times during the battle. This happens once every time
you take off 50 HP.

While the Meteor Parasite is hiding, run up against the Meteor until you're running
against it. The flaps will open and about five-hundred lasers will spread across the
screen. Unless you're against the meteor, which you should be, the laser can't be
avoided. The Meteor Parasite will do this a couple of times, then reveal itself
again. Now, there's a strategy here that is probably the safest strategy that's
available for this level. However, like all safe strategies, it requires lots of
patience. But by doing this, you may only get hit once or twice in the whole battle.
Because the Tentacles are spread out so far apart from the Parasite, don't bother
taking either of them out. Instead, you should notice two rocks to the left and
right of the Meteor Parasite (a little in front of it).

Get in between those two rocks and do a 1-2-3 Combo Attack on the Meteor Parasite.
It's safe to just do two of the strikes and skip the third, but if you want to risk
it, you can go for a third strike. The Parasite will life up, signaling it's about
to do the pink magic circle. At this point, run down south a little, just a tiny bit
past the two rocks. Wait for the explosion to occur and disappear, then rush back in
and do another 1-2-3 Combo Attack. Lather, rinse, repeat (again). Seeing as how the
sword strikes only take off about one damage point each, this WILL take a long time.
However, you won't bit hit by either tentacles and you'll rarely be hit by the
Parasite's attacks. If you get below three hearts, HEAL. You can't risk ANYTHING.
After taking off aonother 150 HP, you'll go to...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BOSS (Form 3): Meteor Parasite
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You're transported to the lowest part of the arena, at the very bottom of the
meteor. This is definitely the hardest form, and it can be quite frustrating.
However, using a strategy that is sorta like a combined strategy for the first and
second form, I was able to beat the third form on my first try. You are in a small,
cramped area where the two Tentacles are VERY close to the Meteor Parasite. Not
good. The one on your left spits fire and is vulnerable to ice, while the one on
your right spits ice and poison and is vulnerable to fire. The Meteor Parasite keeps
Hell's Little Pink Circle of Death (of course, it's only one of the most annoying
attacks in the game), and gets rid of the huge laser attack, but replaces it with
another SERIOUSLY deadly attack.

Again, HLPCoD is used the most throughout the battle, requiring you to run madly
around the arena, trying to avoid it. The second, final attack of the Meteor
Parasite comes right after the pink circle attack is used. A bunch of flashing
lights will appear on the larva-thing that the Parasite is attatched to and then a
HUGE amount of bullets will strike the area. Move around constantly. One bullet can
take off about a heart, which isn't that bad. However, about fifty of them are fired
at once, so hitting a lot can kill you. Now, like you did in Form One, you will not
want to eliminate both Tentacles. It takes a long time for the Tentacles to respawn,
but killing both takes quite a while and you'll get almost no time to attack the
Meteor Parasite, so it's not really worth it.

Take out the Tentacle on the left using six Blizzara moves. It's hard to take it out
this time, unlike in Form One, because you have to deal with the pink circles, as
well as the Tentacle body slamming you, cancelling any spell you're charging. It
takes a couple of minutes to wipe out the Tentacle, but be patient. Once it's out of
your way, run up to the Parasite and do a 1-2-3 Combo Attack. It's REALLY
recommended that you ONLY do two strikes and not do the third. The Parasite will
charge the pink circle near where you're standing. Like in Form Two, run south, to
the back of the arena, and wait for it to explode before rushing in and continuing.
You'll have to deal with the Tentacle on the right, which spits poison at you, but
as long as you constantly move, you should be fine.

You WILL be hit by a poison blast a few times during the battle, so make sure to
have your handy Clear spell ready. Make sure you NEVER fall below four hearts. If
you fall below five, you'll want to rush back and use Cure. But if you get to one or
two, you're in serious danger. I hope you have some Phoenix Downs left, because you
might be needing them here. Anyway, do the strike/run/strike/run strategy until the
Tentacle on the left respawns. Defeat it and continue, avoiding the bullet spray
that the Parasite also uses. Again, after you knock off 50 HP, the Parasite retreats
and simply fires a _HUGE_ amount of bullets at you, so heal yourself fully and then
run like hell until the Parasite reappears. Yes, the strategy is slow, just like all
the others.

But it is safe, the safest strategy I can think of, and that's what matters. Once
you defeat the Meteor Parasite, run to the phone and call Nintendo and tell them, "I
HAVE BEATEN THE METEOR PARASITE! WORSHIP ME, FOR I AM YOUR GOD!" And Nintendo will
say, "No, you still have one more area, so go away and beat it." And then you'll
walk slowly back to your Gamecube, ready to enter the...

NOTE! HUGE NOTE! HOLY CRAP, MAJOR NOTE: THE FOLLOWING SECTION CONTAINS FREAKING
SPOILERS FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! SPOILERS! WHILE YOU MAY THINK THE PLOT TO THIS GAME
SUCKS, IT GETS A __LOT__ BETTER HERE AND THERE ARE MANY SURPRISES! YOU HAVE BEEN
FREAKING WARNED! CONSIDER THIS YOUR ONLY WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I will be describing the plot revealed here in actual game text, using quotation
marks so you know when you're about to encounter a plot twist thing.

I really hope you have a shitload of memories (I apologize for the language),
because you'll really need them. Again, 80+ is recommended, but the more you have,
the better. Also, it's really useful if you read your diary throughout the years
during the celebrations. I told you to re-read it before you entered Mount Vellenge,
but I bet a third of you didn't listen to that. Well, you'll have to face the
consequences :) Take a single step forward and a glowing ball will appear, and
reveal the shape of a woman. Approach her and she'll say that you'll be easy prey
for Raem. After playing with your mind by teleporting everywhere, she'll say that
you and her will always be one (Wherever there is light, there is shadow). She'll
then mention two people named Leon and Hurdy.

She'll tell you to prepare yourself, for you have roused Raem. Oh noes, who is Raem?
After you gain control, talk to her again. She'll release two Red Minions. Minions
are the toughest enemies in the game, but these are some of the easier Minions.
Defeat them using magic (Thunder recommended). The girl will tell you to run, but
speak to her again. She'll warp you to yet another place. Talk to her once more.
She'll explain more about Raem...

"You see, Raem lays claim to all your memories, even those etched deeply into your
minds. All that is remembered shall eventually be forgotten. But some memories are
held close while their warmth remains. Such memories are too dazzling for me to
grasp. I wonder... Perhaps memories that shine brightly are too much for even Raem's
greedy clutches. Perhaps you might never have made it here without such radiant
memories lighting your way. Perhaps if your most powerful memories strike Raem... If
you wish with all your heart to return home... your desire will strike him down!
Hold fast to your brightest memories and step through the doors of recollection. You
will face Raem soon enough!"

Talk to her again once she's done explaining and she'll reveal a big, wooden door,
the door of recollection. She'll then insert the keyh of rememberance.

"Your most powerful memories will serve you when you're through the door. But faded
memories will mutate into monsters and turn upon their master! Answer with care!
Remain calm and focus! It takes only a single powerful memory to open the door."

You'll now be asked a single question. If you looked at your diary like I told you
to, then you'll be able to answer it. The question depends on the diary entries in
your Crystal Chronicles, so if you have not encountered something, a question
relating to that encounter will not appear. Answer the question correctly to proceed
through the door. Answer incorrectly and you'll lose memories (if you have a GBA
out, you can see your memory count). Also, Minions will appear. Once you've defeated
the Minions/answer the question, the door will open. Go through it...

"I remember when Leon and Hurdy came here. Raem robbed them of their memories, and I
could do nothing but watch. After seizing their memories, Raem seemed somehow
dissatisfied. I believe it was because they had always focused on the future and had
too few memories to savor. But you seem different from them. I sense it. Please, try
your hardest to remember everything!"

Another question will be asked. Again, it is based on your Crystal Chronicles.
Remember, you pass through the door if you get it right, you fight Minions and lose
memories if you get it wrong. Let me note here that the game ends if your memories
drop below ten.

"I wonder, did you imagine your mother's face beyond the light? Or perhaps the face
of a friend? If so, then that means your memory of them has grown stronger."

Head through the door and the girl will make another door appear.

"Long ago, a meteor crashed down and shattered the great crystal. It warped the
natural course of the world. Raem was born of that cataclysm. He gorges himself on
memories, and from those memories are monsters born. Monsters further the cycle by
making you suffer. And then, Raem consumes your painful memories with delight. I
want to see this age come to an end... I want to see memories properly spun and
return to nature... I want to revive that golden age..."

Answer the next question. If you've gotten all three asked so far wrong, then a
Monstorous Minion will appear. Holy crap, those guys are HARD! They have a whopping
120 HP, but are vulnerable to pretty much all magic. So DON'T get three wrong.
Please. Once ready, approach the door.

"On one hand, painful memories can sometimes help one grow. On the other hand,
joyful memories can make one look only backward and forget about moving forward. All
memories are someday forgotten. When they are, it's because I nibble on them from
time to time. For I am the Queen of Reflection, Mio."

Go through the door here.

"Miasma arises from something deep inside Mount Vellenge known as the meteor
parasite. Raem depends on the wicked power of miasma. That is why he tried to stop
you from finishing off the meteor parasite. The power of memories here is immense
compared to that of your world. Believe in their power for just a little longer!

Answer the next question correctly/incorrectly and head through the door.

"Raem draws near. He is close. But... your memories blaze so brightly! I can endure
them no longer... Such a terrible glow! You may well defeat Raem. And now, one final
question! Focus, and answer carefully."

Well, I don't know about you, but the first time through I got all questions
correct. It's quite easy if you looked through your diary. You'll be forced to go
through one. final. door.

"I believe... that beyond the light a dazzling future awaits."

Ready yourself... and go through the door.

"One moment. I'd like to share something before you face Raem. Memories, you see...
They are like a pack that you carry as you trek toward the future. This burden
cannot be too heavy, nor can it be too light. If it is too heavy, it will weigh you
down before you ever reach your destination. If it is too light, you will reach your
destination having gained nothing from the journey. But memories can brighten your
journey if balanced at just the right weight. Stop along the way now and then... to
look about and savor the view. A traveller grows from such a journey and spins the
best memories from it. Those memories become myrrh and are collected by the next
traveller. Please, do not abandon the spinning of more memories. They are needed for
a stable, tranquil future. Come. We cannot turn back now!"

Are you ready?

You are transported to simply the most beautful arena game history has even
encountered, along with Mio.

"Here he comes."

Raem will appear out of the dust, in an amazing display of color. By the looks of
him, he's a Phoenix.

Raem: "Why, if it isn't Lady Mio! What is all this? I see you have brought a mortal
to this realm. This will not do."

Mio: "Enough! We dwell in a world of memories. If you would eat justa  few memories
and return them as dew, we could live in harmony forever!"

Raem: "We may have begun the same way, Lady Mio. But as you should well know, I was
raised on miasma, nourished by it. Both memories and miasma are quite essential to
me. For you see, of all the many memories born of this world of miasma... the ones
filled with sorrow are the most delicious of them all. Indeed, the final memories of
the villagers of Tida were truly succulent. One of these days, my near Lady Mio, you
must try some!"

Mio: "You cannot be serious. Raem, you and I are both born of memory! We have no
need to devour memories, nor have we any need for miasma!"

Raem: "But that was so very long ago... I wonder if other delicacies will ever
surpass the memories of Tida. Perhaps we could start with the memories of that
caravanner there? I wonder how they taste..."

Mio: "No, you will never touch them. These memories burn too brightly for you!"

Raem: "Oh, are your memories truly that powerful? Well... That makes me hunger for
them all the more!"

Mio: "Raem, that is enough!"

She'll shatter the shield blocking you.

Raem: "Fool!"

Raem will then knock out Lady Mio.

~~~~~~~~~~
BOSS: Raem
~~~~~~~~~~
You face each other at last. Raem here has 300 HP, and basically one slash equals
one point of damage. Oh, yay. That means you have to hit Raem 300 times before he
perishes. However, this can actually be an easy battle, despite the fact that it
might take you a half-hour to beat. However, using the strategy I'll list below, I
didn't have to use one Phoenix Down. Okay, Raem has six evil attacks, but let me
tell you about the Minions that wander around first. There are two Minions here, a
Red Minion and a Blue Minion. The Red Minion is stronger, and has 24 HP while the
Blue Minion is weak and has only 15 HP. If you defeat both, two more will appear
quickly. Therefore, you must defeat only one. Can you guess which one you'll want to
defeat?

Go for the Red Minion before you lay a finger on Raem, and avoid attacking the Blue
Minion at all costs. Once the Red Minion is down, you can begin fighting with Raem.
If you are playing with two, three, or four people, then try to cast Slowga or Stop
on the Blue Minion to keep it from attacking you as much. Raem keeps his wings
spread out for pretty much the entire battle, revealing his vulnerable spot, which
is his face. His wings are very dangerous, since they spit out Magicite Bubbles.
There are blue bubbles, red bubbles, and purple bubbles. Remember the Giant Crab,
where it spit out bubbles to cast slow on you? Well, these are just like those. They
move slowly, although they home in on you and two are spit out at one time. A blue
bubble will freeze you, a red bubble will burn you, and a purple bubble will
paralyze you.

Simple enough. Okay, whenever you run up to Raem's face to attack him, he might
shake his head from side to side. This can knock you back and do at least one heart
of damage, which can somtimes be quite annoying if the Blue Minion is behind you
attacking as well. If you are close to his wings, he will push both of his wings
together and try to crush you, which also usually takes away a full heart from your
health meter. The final attack only happens when you have gotten Raem down to 150
HP. He'll shoot from his two sides two laser beams. The lasers don't hurt you, but
they cause a huge inferno that causes SERIOUS damage. DON'T. ENTER. THE LASER'S.
BLAST RADIUS. I cannot say that enough! If you stay in close to Raem or stay far
away from the laser when it is used, you'll be safe.

Even after you get him down to 150 HP, he'll rarely use the attack (although it'll
be used more and more as his health meter gets lower and lower). Okay, you may think
I'm crazy here when I give this strategy. Avoid the Minion as you rush in, do a 1-2-
3 Combo Attack (it's your decision whether to do two strikes or three) then rush out
as Raem shakes his head. Rush back in and do another 1-2-3 Combo Attack, then
retreat. When the Minion reaches you and Raem, run to the edge of the arena and heal
if you've suffered ANY amount of damage. ANY. You have no idea how bad off you'll be
if you're hit by the laser a couple of times, so you'll want to be at full health at
all times. Lather, rinse, repeat. Eventually, you'll deal enough damage where Raem
will fall...

Raem: "You... How could runts like you fell the great Raem?"

Mi: "Raem... Though the miasma may fade away, you will now perish with it. So
please... Believe me.

Raem: "Mio! I don't want to fade! I will not fade! Even if I must possess you!
Mio... Don't... let... me... fade..."

Shattered glass. Teleportation. You are now in an amazing area above the clous,
where you can see the world from a distant view. This is the area where you shall
face the final boss. You have a brief moment to prepare yourself. Equip a Phoenix
Down (I hope you have lots left) and make sure you're at full health. Rush forward
to see your home planet, and look above to find a SERIOUSLY amazing sight. The REAL
Raem will appear out of the Gamecube's beautiful graphics. He looks so damn cool.
Ready yourself.

"I will never fade!"

MAJOR NOTE: It's about time you faced a challenge. Since many of you have probably
been following this guide through for the whole game, and maybe some of you just
started, I don't think you should look at the guide for the final boss. Really, you
DO need a challenge. If you looked at this guide just for the final boss, then I
really hope you are TOTALLY hopeless when facing him. I'vd listed the strategy for
the final boss anyway, but let me say this: is it really that fun if you beat the
last enemy with a guide?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FINAL BOSS: Raem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This. Is. One. Helluva. Hard. Boss. Yes. It is Raem attached to a giant sword, with
a small enemy thing below it. It takes place in a geourgous graphic arena, and Raem
himself IS the Gamecube's power. Literally, they must've spent forever developing
Raem's final form! Despite the fact that he looks absolutely perfect, he is VERY
VERY VERY VERY VERY tough. But yes, I managed to beat him on my first try using
about five-hundred Phoenix Downs. It's VERY essential that you have at least 80
memories, and if you have 100 memories, you're all set. Why? I'll explain later.
First, let me explain the seven hellish attacks Raem has. The first four attacks
happen only when the lower part of Raem's body is showing. The top part will fire a
laser down at the screen and a white circle will cover the ground.

If you're standing anywhere but the edge of that circle, you have no chance of
escaping. If you ARE standing at the edge, GET OUT OF THE CIRCLE! This is like the
laser in the last battle, and it takes away about four hearts, meaning two hits with
it can instantly KO you. He fires this constantly, especially when you're far away
from him, so stay in close and heal RIGHT after he uses it if you're hit. This is
probably the most deadly attack Raem uses while he's on the ground. The second
attack involves the lower part of the body sending a small laser through the ground
which doesn't hurt you, but makes ice appear which shortly shatters. THAT can hurt
you, so stay away from it at all costs. The third attack is an evil purple gas of
death.

Raem's lower body will spray it and it'll stop you for a few seconds. Nothing major,
but if the laser follows, then you're in trouble. The final attack can't hurt you,
but it is used for eating your memories (I'll explain more about the memories in
this battle later). The upper part of Raem's body holds the most deadly attacks. The
first attack is a single black laser that fires in a straight line. It can take a
huge chunk out of your health (3-4 hearts, maybe more) if you're hit, so constantly
move to avoid being shot. The second attack is fired out of Raem's twin cannons; two
pink lasers will be shot, and both of them deal about three hearts worth of damage,
which can be very bad. The last attack is a blast of white light that also does
around three hearts of damage.

Remember, keep moving to avoid all three upper attacks. Now, let me finally tell you
why you've been needed all of those memories. At the start of the battle, bubbles
which contain members of your family will start to appear. These are your memories.
If you look at your memory count, it decreases each time a bubble appears. If you
cast Cure on it, it'll transform into a tiny pink ball, know as the Ultracite. This
is the most powerful Magicite ever, which can only be found in the final battle.
Pick as many of these up as you can, since without them, you're pretty much hopeless
when fighting Raem. If you wait too long, and you're looking at Raem's lower body,
he'll suck the memory in, eating it. This doesn't really do anything to you, other
than preventing you from getting the Ultracite out of that memory.

You need as many Ultracites as possible. What do they do, you ask? Well, casting one
will instantly charge up either Firaga, Blizzaga, Thundaga, or Curaga. It can also
cast the best spell in the game, Invincibility. The more memories you have, the more
Ultracite you'll receive, and they are the key to winning the battle. If you get
Invincibilty, a blue shield will instantly surround you and stay there for about a
minute. Use this time to rush up to whatever vulnerable point and start slashing as
much as you  can. If you're facing the lower body, you must slash the small little
enemy attatched to the big sword. This does no damage to Raem itself, but eventually
Raem will lower itself so you're facing the upper body. When you're facing the upper
body, the only real way to hurt it is if you have Invincibility.

Run up in between Raem's wings and start slashing away. If you don't have
Invincibility, then you must wait for Raem to attack, quickly rush in and do two or
three swipes, then retreat. It's a really slow process, so that's why you'll want to
make sure you have so many memories available. Cure OFTEN. NEVER wait until you have
one or two hearts, because one more hit and you're GONE! You probably WILL need to
use Phoenix Downs during this battle, so make sure to have at least three (I had
around fifteen and used all but two). If you keep slashing Raem's upper body, you'll
eventually beat him. YAY!

SPOILERS! SPOILERS! SPOILERS!

Raem: "Not yet! Not..."

You will be sitting in the clouds and then Mio will appear in the sky. You'll run up
to her and watch as she falls to the ground.

Mio: "Now we can defeat the meteor parasite. At long last... The world can return to
its proper course! Raem and I... will sleep for a time. But, worry not. As long as
you spin memories, someday... we will be reborn. I want you to remember... Remember
me from time to time. O keepers of the crystal... Thank you."

She'll vanish and a small crystal will appear in her place. You'll be warped back to
the Meteor Parasite, where you have to fight it all over again. Just kidding. The
Parasite will be lying there, helpless, and you'll arrive. Simply run up to it and
deliver the final blow. The whole parasite will slowly begin to explode and light
will escape from the top. A huge burst of light will appear from Mount Vellenge,
which will cover the entire world, ridding it of miasma. The sky will be covered in
a giant shadow, which will destroy all miasma. Your caravan will return home, and
everyone in your family will greet you.

                                     ***

There are approximately __10o__ enemies in Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles. Holy
crap, that's a lot of enemies. Each enemy will be counted as a single percentage
point towards completion. Here,I'll list the name of the monster, how powerful it is
against different types of magic, it's HP, Strength, Defense, and Magic Power, and
whether it has a sepcial weakness or resistance. Any additional notes will also be
added if needed.

Please note that depending on what cycle you're on in a dungeon and how many people
are playing, the HP for enemies will double. This is the chart:

  +-----------------------------+
  | Cycle 1 | Cycle 2 | Cycle 3 |
--+-----------------------------+
1P| Default | x1.5    | x2.5    |
--+-----------------------------+
2P| x1.25   | x1.875  | x3.125  |
--+-----------------------------+
3P| x1.5    | x2.25   | x3.75   |
--+-----------------------------+
4P| x1.75   | x2.625  | x4.375  |
--+-----------------------------+

Note: All enemies will be listed in alphabetical order. Also, the Strength, Defense,
Magic, and Spell resistance levels are courtesy of the Nintendo Power Player's
Guide.

Okay, here's the setup for the Spell Resistance Levels:

*=very weak against spell
x=weak against spell
o=neither weak nor resistant against spell
%=powerful against spell

There are six Magicite Stones, eleven forms of Magic, and thirty-eight different
powerful levels of magic you can cast. Sound confusing? Well, it sorta is, but once

multiplayer mode, and fusing magic becomes more complicated once you get to
multiplayer. All levels of magicite can be cast when in multiplayer mode (though you
might need more players for the harder magicite), but only a total of seventeen
levels of magic can be used in single player.

Fire Magicite is an orange stone dropped by enemies, and it is also one of the five

Name of Magicite | Power |
--------------------------       Fire magic is one of the three common types of
Fire             | 30    |       magic that you see. It lowers the defense of any

Fira             | 15-45 |       slightly increased. To cast any of the three levels

Life Magicite is important in single player because it's used for fusing some of the

Clear Magicite is underrated. It is one of the most important magicites to have,
sine it can heal any type of status effect (yes, even Haste). But most people I know
who have this game don't seem to find it important... and then I laugh over their
shoulders when they die due to poison =P Anyway, it IS an important piece of magic
that you should always have. Clear Magicite is, well... clear >_>

Holy can do a lot of stuff, and that doesn't just involve doing a nice bit of
damage. Holy is also not an actual Magicite; you must fuse it with other magicite to

--------------------------       Gravity is unique in quite a few ways. First, it
Gravity          |Depends|       can cause massive damage or cause almost no damage
--------------------------       depending on what enemy you're facing. If the enemy
Gravira          |Depends|       is very weak against Gravity, half its HP is sucked
--------------------------       up. If it it's somewhat weak, then you can suck up
Graviga          |Depends|       a quarter of its HP, and you can only suck up a
--------------------------       tenth if it isn't weak against it at all. Some
                                 enemies are totally invulnerable to Gravity. Check
                                 the enemy chart to find out which enemies are weak
                                 against the spell. Second, it can bring flying
                                 enemies down to the ground. Most flying enemies
                                 can't attack if they aren't in the air, so it's
                                 easy to defeat them. And third, both Gravira and
                                 Graviga have the same Magicite requirements. So how
                                 do you know what spell you'll cast? First, let me
                                 explain the requirements of Gravity. Player two
                                 must cast their spell within a third of a second
                                 after player one casts it. This applies to Graviga
                                 as well, and player three must cast their spell
                                 within a third of a second also. For Gravira,
                                 player two must cast their spell within a third of
                                 a second after player one and player three must
                                 cast their spell from a third of a second to two-
                                 thirds of a second after player one.

+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+

Slow spells will make an enemy move slower (well, duh), but it will double the time
that is required for them to cast spells. Remember, this spell can be cast on you as
well, and not only will your spell charge time be doubled, but your focus attack
charge time will be doubled as well!

                                 three have to cast theirs from a third to two-
                                 thirds after player one.

+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+

Haste is one of the best spells to cast on yourself. It'll increase your speed by
1.5 and half the time it takes to charge magic and focus attacks. It is costly to do
though, especially in multiplayer mode.

POWER OF MAGICITE

--------------------------
Name of Magicite | Power |
--------------------------       Haste is probably one of the spells that I use the
Haste            |Speed +|       most, since the fact that your speed increases
--------------------------       greatly can really help in some of those hard
Hastega          |Speed +|       battles. However, I don't reccomend that you use
--------------------------       Haste in a battle that requires magic, since it
                                 takes up three Command Slots to use in single-
                                 player. Haste and Heastega are fused with the same
                                 timing; players two through four must cast their
                                 spell from a third to two-thirds after player one
                                 casts theirs.

+====---------------------------------------------------------------------====+

Stop is one of the kind. No Stopra or Stopaga or something, just Stop. And for a
good reason; if Stop has a level two or three, it would be WAY too powerful.

POWER OF MAGICITE

--------------------------
Name of Magicite | Power |
--------------------------       Stop freezes an enemy in its tracks for a short
Stop             | Frozen|       amount of time (longer than freeze or paralysis
--------------------------       does). If you use Stop on an enemy, you can easily
                                 escape it. I like to use Stop in the later levels,
                                 like Lynari Desert and Mount Vellenge, where I am
                                 overrun by powerful enemies. To use Stop in multi-
                                 player, player two needs to cast their spell from
                                 a third to two-thirds of a second after player one,
                                 while player three needs to cast their spell from
                                 two-thirds of a second to a second after player
                                 one.

This part of the guide will show all of the diary entries in my Chronicles. Before
you all ask, "What the hell is the point of this?" let me explain: in The Nest of
Memories, you're asked five questions based on your Crystal Chronicles. If you can't
remember the answers, just look here; there is a chance that some of my diary
entries will be similar to yours. I will not be posting ALL of my entries, because
some are not important (ex. "I went and re-beat the Malboro. It was an easy win,
blah blah blah). Okay, so let's start!

Page 1
******
The mroning of my departure was here at last. I tried to brace myself for the
journey ahead. There was a field along the main road where I decided to camp until
sunrise. Tomorrow I set out in search of myrrh.

Page 2
******
Not far from the village, someone called to me. The man introduced himself as Sol
Racht, leader of the caravan from Alfitaria. It seems that news of my caravan had
already reached them. They showed me much kindness, and a moogle named Stiltzkin
gave me a lesson in combat.

Page 3
******
I visited a moogle nest for the first time. The moogle there cheerfully welcomed me
into his home. When it was time to go, I thought he looked a bit sad. I batted the
bonbon on his head and bade him farewell. If wonder if all moogles live so
cofortably.

Page 4
******
I wound my way through the vivid green hills and followed the path to reach the
River Belle. All my tension seemed to flow away with the River Belle's serence
currents. As I pressed onward, I slew many goblins. I soon saw a rainbow over a
great waterfall. Who would have known that I would fight the giant crab surrounded
by such beauty!

Page 5
******
I came across the caravan from Alfitaria today. The town was already abuzz with talk
of the Black Knight, but Sol had more tales to tell. Sol spoke with such enthusiasm
that he actually seemd to admire him. It is astonishing how quickly the word of the
Black Knight has spred in spite of the way miasma insolates every town.

Page 6
******
The miasma stream. Many caravans have passed through, and now I will follow in their
tracks. Someday, others will follow me. I feel like I have become a small part of
history.

Page 7
******
As I approach the Mushroom Forest, I somehow feel likke I'm shrinking. Each
toadstool I pass seems taller than the last. Now I knoww I am inside the forest, I'm
walking along a rooftop of a mushroom. Although a malboro blocked my path, I
prevailed and collected a drop of myrrh.

Page 8
******
The Mine of Cathuriges is a relic of the age of Liltian reign. Orcs rule it now. As
I ventured deep into the mine, I kept jumping at my own shadow, cast on the walls by
the flickering lamps overhead. I found the orc king waiting for me in the deepest
cavern within. After my victory, I collected a drop of myrrh.

Page 9
******
With my first journey behind me, my caravan has finally come home. Before setting
out, I had heard only stories of the world outside. Once out there, I found
excitement, surprise, and a bit of hardship. Whenever I close my eyes, I vividly
remember all my adventures as I searched for myrrh. Tonight is the festival. It's
time to celebrate!

Page 10
*******
Goblin Wall lies east of Tipa, nestled among the mountains of Kutliema. As expected,
the place was infested with goblins. They engage in the dark and sinister
ceremonies, so the people of my village fear them. I planned a daring raid into the
goblins' lair to the collect the myrrh there. It worked. The village should be safe
for now.

Page 11
*******
I came upon the caravan from Marr's Pass. It was overturned. Few monsters prowl the
road, and I've rarely seen such things in all my travels. The sight was so bizarre
that I merely stared in amazement before it ocurred to me to lend a hand.
Thankfully, no one was badly hurt. They said they were attacked by the infamous
Black Knight. Why would he do such a thing?

Page 12
*******
Early this morning, I passed the caravan from Alfitaria. They proudly marched right
past me! I must admit, they were an impressive sight.

Page 13
*******
Today I decided to take a side road for a change of pace. To my surprise, I heard
someone call out to my caravan. It was a group of kindly-looking Clavats. A look at
their clothes told me that they probably hailed from the Fields of Fum.

Page 14
*******
Today I paid a visit to Moschet Manor. I felt small in the Mushroom Forest, but here
I'm like an ant! I met the gigas master and his lamia wife, together with their
tonberry chefs. I almost felt sorry for the chaos I brought into their home. Perhaps
I should have knocked.

Page 15
*******
I was amazed to meet a traveller who did not belong to any caravan. He was stranded
since is papaopamus was injured. I lent him some ointment from back home. In return,
he showed me his compact crystal, something I had only heard of. Imagine, a portable
crystal! But carrying something like that around is just asking for a visit from a
band of... No, could he have been...?

Page 16
*******
They say that the myrrh tree sprouted to Tida after the village fell to ruin. The
tree grew from the hopes of people waiting for the caravan to return home. But at
the same time, those hopes also gave rise to Armstrong. Now I understand why
caravans try to avoid this place.

Page 17
*******
So ends the second year of my caravan. Miasma hindered my steps, and monsters struck
at me from behind. Still, I'll always look back fondly on the warm smiles that
greeted me in villages I visited, and it was always a joy to meet other caravans on
the long, lonely road. I hope I see them again next year.

Page 18
*******
After eating, I was preparing to set off, when suddenly some Lilties ran by, in hot
pursuit of a monster. They were probably from Marr's Pass. That village has long
been home to blacksmiths, so they were probably off gathering materials.

Page 19
*******
Shella, citadel of the Yukes. There is a slight chill in the air, and I find it hard
to velieve that Tipa and Shella are part of the same world. They say that Yukes
dress in strange ways to maximize their magical abilities. Someone once said they
have no bodies, only souls. Yukes are a mysterious people indeed.

Page 20
*******
According to ancient Yukish lore, flan dislike fire, for heat can melt their
gelationous flesh. For reasons unknown, they are unaffected by spells that later
time, such as Slow and Stop. The more powerful dark flan cannot be harmed until a
Holy spell is cast upon them.

Page 21
*******
Veo Lu Sluice is a monument to peace. The myrrh tree sprouted here as if to
celebrate the coming of such times. It is unfortunate, however, that the tree grew
near the golem, who was left there to protect the sluice from monsters. I suppose it
just goes to show that nothing can be gained without toil.

Page 22
*******
I spotted the Striped Brigands by the main road. I recently heard that they'd klled
a man, so I asked them for the truth. They claimed that they never take lives. As I
talked with them, I realized they are good people at heart. I think I can trust
them.

Page 23
*******
I wonder why anyone would actually want to travel into miasma. Today I met a
stranger named Gurdy who was nearly killed by the caravan from Marr's Pass.
Lightning brings the cactus pain. Now it all begins again. I'm not quite sure what
the verse means, but I think he recited it to me as thanks.

Page 24
*******
The Fields of Fum. It is said that Clavats work tirelessly to cultivate this land.
But it is also said that Yukes irrigated this land and that the main road was built
by Lilties long ago. This place truly demonstrates the potential of peace.

Page 25
*******
By the time caravans reach Daemon's Court, the long journey has made them weary and
some arrogant. The name of the place is intended to be a warning to stay alert and
not succumb to fatigue or overconfidence. I must brace myself.

Page 26
*******
Today I learned of flan. Their gelationous bodies have no arms or legs. They attack
by coiling up their bodies and then springing at foes in a ferocious head butt. They
also spit a sticky, acid substance from their gaping mouths. Though this acid lacks
the power to melt weapons or armor, it can restrict the victim's movements.

Page 27
*******
Winds have always come from Selepation Cave beyond the southern forests of the
plains of Fum. But who could have known it was the cave worm's doing? After
collecting the myrrh there, I looked back from the mouth of the cave. No wind
stirred now that the monster had drawn its last breath. Legends are only legends,
after all. But as I turned to leave, a gust of wind brushed my chreeks.

Page 28
*******
My third year with the caravan draws to a close. As I made new memories this year,
those from the last began to fade. In one fairy tale, memories that grow dim are
eaten by a terrible demon. I wonder what happens to memories when they're completely
forgotten... I suppose looking back and chersing the past can bring sadness when we
face the future.

Page 29
*******
Today I saw the caravan from Alfitaria. I was shocked to hear that the Black Knight
had attacked the caravan from Marr's Pass. Furious, he began to look into the
history of the Black Knight. The last thing anyone had heard was that a preacher had
hired him, and the pair had headed deep into the swamp.

Page 30
*******
I was surrounded by the Striped Brigands, and they took everything of value.
Actually, it was more like I gave it to them. Why did I do that? I should get some
sleep now.

Page 31
*******
I saw the couple from Leuda. The two Selkies form the caravan from that distant
village. They asked how my quest for myrrh was going, but they seemed awfully
nonchalant about their own.

Page 32
*******
I found the caravans from Alfitaria and from Marr's Pass shouting at each other.
Though all were Lilties, it seems that city folk and country folk don't get along.
Who can blame them? They've each chosen different paths in life.

Page 33
*******
Marr's Pass. This land was once home of the Lilties. With the iron weapons they
wrought here, they once ruled the entire world. Now, this place is but a small town
at the crossroads. Time washes away everything. Joy. Agony. Everything.

Page 34
*******
I ran across the caravan from Marr's Pass. They were heading home with their chalice
full of myrrh. They were quite generous with weapons they'd found, as some were of
no use to them. I suppose that great blacksmiths like them prefer their own weapons
over those wrought by others anyway.

Page 35
*******
I sailed into the islands of Kilanda and landed safely, much to my relief. Mount
Kilanda fumed angrily in the distance. I hurried onward. At the summit waited the
iron giant, who gave me a fair amount of trouble. All is well, though, and I am back
on the coast.

Page 36
*******
Gurdy again. Today he was arguing with a lady from Fum. Why does he argue with
caravanners when he cannot travel without one? Of crumed iin few reminisce. Its
faulty beams will not be missed. I wonder if this is a famous verse. Well, I don't
expect him to repay me anytime soon.

Page 37
*******
This morning I ran into the caravan from Marr's Pass. They are always hunting
monsters, and sometimes they catch one. Today they shared some of their bounty with
me. I know I can't worry for every village out there, but I wonder how their hunt
for myrrh is going.

Page 38
*******
Today I visited Conall Curach. As I marched over those endless planks, I began to
understand how the Selkies must have felt. The dragon zombie awaited me at the end.
Long ago, Selkies must have fought this creature in their search for a new home. The
myrrh tree drooped mournfully, as if it marked where the Selkies' dreams were
buried.

Page 39
*******
I camped with the caravan from Fum and walked with them for a while this morning.
Their gentle manner reminded me of my family. When I spoke of my parents'
profession, they gave me some advice on farming. Perhaps I'll send some seeds back
home.

Page 40
*******
I came across the couple from Leuda. They asked me how I was doing in a nonchanlant
way, but the moment they saw how much myrrh I had gathered, they grew downright
furious. I didn't want trouble, so I hurried on my way.

Page 41
*******
Rebena Te Ra. They say this city was built by misguided souls who clung to dreams of
reviving the long lost age of prosperity. Now, its king and his subjects dwell here
in eternal afterlife. After the lich vansihed through the portal, a ghostly silence
gripped the chamber.

Page 42
*******
My fourth year with the caravan is over. So many memories from my earlier adventures
have dimmed, from the joys of chance encounters to the suspense of my first battles.
It would be a pity if the goal of gathering myrrh became the only thing that drove
me forward. But I can't look back only at the past. The quest for myrrh means hope
for the future.

Page 43
*******
So that was the Black Knight.
Berserk is the only word the comes to mind. Swinging his weapon wildly, he hunted
something I could not see. In a weary voice, he claimed that his memory had been
stolen and that he is now searching for the thief.

Page 44
*******
I can't believe it! I knew there was something suspicious about Gurdy, but to think
he's a swindler! I saw him cheat the caravan from Shella. At any rate, his verse for
today follows: Lonely mushroom bursts to flame. In the land the quicksands claim.
Apparently, he penned all of these himself.

Page 45
*******
This is the village of the Selkies. At first, I felt a little scared. Even now, I
shiver when I remember the old pier and the sharp winds. I also shivered when I
realized that someone had snatched by wallet. I never want to come here agian.

Page 46
*******
I heard voices from afar and was dismayed to find that they belonged to the couple
from Leuda. They seemed trylty distressed this time. I bought some things from them
only after haggling their prices way down, just to spite them. Still, I hope they
are all right.

Page 47
*******
Here I am in the Lynari Desert. A sea of sand stretches in every direction. Bruied
treasure? I feared I wouldn't even find a myrrh tree in this desolation. The
legendary treasure had to wait. I fought the antlion and collected a drop of myrrh.
My, I'm a long way from home!

Page 48
*******
I ran across the caravan from Leuda. Those two Selkies are some characters. They
seemed to be enjoying the journey more than observing their duty. It was a
refreshing outlook, but it worried me. I began to understand how Sol of Alfitaria
must have felt about me.

Page 49
*******
Today a voice hailed me from a distance. Amidatty of Shella beckoned me closer.
Pointing to a loaf of ordinary bannock, he boasted that it was a model of the whole
world, and I simply nodded along. Ah, now I remember! It was the same loaf that
Gurday was hawking before.

Page 51
*******
Leut's of Marr's Pass gave me some advice: "Flan carry nothing worth of note. Well,
water flan sometimes have chilly gel, which may come in handy."

Page 53
*******
Five years have passed since I first set out. There was a man who lost his memory
and spent his days chasing some sort of light. HOw could anyone go on without any
memory at all? Perhaps he hunts the light because, stripped of his memory, he has
nothing left. If he still had his memory, he would surely have chosed a different
path.

Page 54
*******
Today I witnessed the death of the Black Knight. A boy named Leon Esla was riding
with the caravan from Alfitaria. He drove his spear into the knight. THe Black
Knight seemed at peace when he died. I wish I knew why.

Page 55
*******
Was I dreaming? Or did I really see something on Gurdy's back? He mentioned
something quite strange. He said he had a brother whome he had never met. What could
he mean by that? Three rocks await the winter's kiss. One by one they find their
bliss.

Page 56
*******
According to ancinet Yukish lore, griffins are quite vulnerable to fire. They can
also be frozen for a short period of time with ice spell fusion. THe spell Slow is
effective against them, but Stop is not. Spells of lightning and gravity are
useless.

Page 57
*******
Mag Mell, village of legend. Or rather, a village trying to disappear from legend.
Has time stopped here? The air is stifflinig. A peculiar wind blows through.

Page 59
*******
I found the caravan from Fum travelling near the main roads, and they tried to push
their goods onto me. Sheula claimed that they had too much to carry home, but I
could tell from the gleam in Jake's eyes that they were just after my money. I never
suspected Clavats could be so sly. I bought nothing from them, of course.

Page 60
*******
Leuts of Marr's Pass gave me some advice: "The gigas lord, huh? What about the gown
Jack wears, the lord's robes? Of course, it's many sizes too big for me, but I'm
sure there must be some use for it."

Page 61
*******
As I rode along the stone path, someone called out to me. It was the caravan from
Shella. I drew nearer, wondering what they wanted. They asked me to make a trade and
seemed to know exactly what I carried. Intrigued by their offer, I agreed.

Page 62
*******
My first visit to Alfitaria. Huge buildings, crowded together. Lotws of strange
people hurrying about. To me, they all look the same. They all wear the same hunted
expression, as through something is chasing them down.

Page 65
*******
Today was the end of my sixth year. I later heard more about the child who slew the
Black Knight. Apparently, his father had left before he was even born. I wondered
whether the boy simply wanted some sort of memory with his father. By avenging his
father'sdeath, he would form an unbreakable link with a man he never had the chance
to know.

Page 66
*******
A band of thieves and a swindler! Lightning brings the cactus pain. Of crumed inn
few reminisce. Lonely mushroom bursts to flame. Three rocks await the winter's kiss.
In the end shall blooom a flower. Sacred light reveals its power. Maybe I can look
for buried treasure there.

Page 70
*******
Tonight I celebrate the end of my seventh year. "In ages past, there was no miasma,
and all the world was a paradise. A princess drew radiance from memories, and with
them she made the crystal shine." Our world used to be this paradise. How could we
forget to hope for a world without miasma?

Page 72
*******
The Striped Brigands suddenly appeared and surounded the caravan. They deamnded I
leave behind all my valuables. Unadunted, I decided to charge through their
blockade. Sorry I ran you over, little moogle. I had a feeling you'd survive.

Page 73
*******
I shared a meal with the caravan from Fum. They offered me bread and meat fresh from
their farm. The bread was incredibly soft, and the meat was tender and delicious.
But the tough bread Mother bakes is still one of my favorites.

Page 75
*******
I came across the caravan from Marr's Pass. Though stout warriors, and even Lilties
suffer a poor hunt now and then. So itwnet this time, as they had been unable to
find all metrials requested by their village. Theyseemed dispirited, and I had just
what they needed, so I gave it to them. It was a good feeling.

Page 76
*******
Today I walked for a while with the carava from Alfitaria. Sol spoke out of nothing
but his fondness for days long gone. I sensed a somewhat defensive air about him, so
I teased him a bit. I expected him to tease me back, but he just muttered, "Youth
these days..." What a pity.

Page 78
*******
My eighth year comes to a close. "One day, a star fell from the heavens. Memories
lost their glow, and the crystal grew dim. From the darkness, a great evil soon
emerged." The rest can be heard in Shella, but this is no children's tale. The
meteor was as real as monsters and miasma.

Page 79
*******
I heard music from the dirt road, where I found the couple from Leuda. It was much
too soon for the myrrh festival, but I stayed long enough to watch the girl dance
and to reminisce about life back home. As the music played, I couldn't sit still,
and I got up to join the dance. It was fun, but a bit embarrassing.

Page 80
*******
A long shadow stretched across the dirt path. It belonged to Amidatty. He pointed to
a loaf of moldy bannock and declared that the mold represents miasma. I was a bit
wary of this by now, but I humored him. For all his quirks, he is a surprisingly
clever man.

Page 82
*******
I came across the caravan from Marr's Pass. Though stout warriors, even Litlties
suffer a poor hunt now andthen. So it went this time, as they had been unable to
find all the materials requested by their village.I offered to sell them what they
needed, but they rejected my price as too high. Perhaps I was a bit greedy. How
unseemly!

Page 84
*******
Leuts of Marr's Pass gave me some advice: "I want a coeurl for a pet. They're so
elegant! They often carry silver, rubies, and sometimes hold water. But I'd hunt
them just for their whiskers!"

Page 86
*******
The curtain falls on my ninth year. "The demon awoke ravenous and began to swallow
the shadows. Monsters sprouted in their wake." The tale is filled with many opposing
elements, like the star and the darkness, the princess and the demon, the crystal's
glow and the monsters. And behind them all lie memories. I think it's trying to
convey something important.

Page 87
*******
According to ancient Yukish lore, cactuars are botanical and loathe fire. Despite
their appearance, their anatomy is similar to that of animals, which may explain
their sensitivity to cold. Lightning does not harm them because the needles that
cover their bodies diffuse the electrical charge. The spells SLow and Stop are also
useless against them.

I came across Amidatty and his caravan. He knew it was nothing but bannock, but he
would not let himself think that way. His kind are peculiar folk, but now I relieve
that this is how they seek knowledge. Maybe that loaf was merely a tool for his
philosopy. Never underestimate Amidatty!

A queen must lead her people. She cannot turn her back on her duty. To be honest, I
have wanted to leave the caravan at times. I felt that I wasn't truly needed. But I
concluded that I wanted to stay. I don't know why, exactly, I guess not knowing is
what keeps me there.

My tenth year with the caravan is over. "Once monsters had blackened our memories,
the demons devoured them. From the darkness, monsters spawned anew." How did the
rest of the story go? There was something about a princess, but I can't remember how
it ends.

According to ancinet Yukish lore, the gigas lord was once immune to cold but has
lost that resistance after residingin his manor for so long. However, he has grown
more resistant to fire and suffers no enchanted effect from fire magic.

Most people I've talked to, and most of the reviews I've read have said that Final
Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles has no story, or at least not a very good one. That's
not true. The story is actually very good, but Square-Enix forgot to do one thing:
explain the thing easily! All the caravan encounters seem totally different from
each other, but as I was typing up my diary entries, I realized that they are all
connected, and they all tie into the main story. You have to think a little bit if
you want to understand the whole story of FFCC, but it sometimes can be a bit
difficult to figure out. So this chapter, while it may seem pointless, will actually
analyze (duh) the story for you :) This chapter may be a little confusing to follow
at first, but you'll eventually understand it.

So, let's start then!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
STORY ANALYSIS PART ONE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upon starting the game, your character will be talking to his or her family, but
that will reveal not part of the plot. They'll be wishing you good luck on your
journey, but what journey are you going on? After you encounter the Afitaria caravan
and visit Port Tipa for the first time, the moogle with the complicated name will
explain this to you. Part one is easy to understand, but it's probably the only one
that's easy to understand :) Long ago, 100 years ago, a terrible meteor smashed into
the earth, releasing a terrible poisonous gas known as miasma. Anyone who came into
contact with this miasma instantly fell to their death (although in the game you
only lose a bit of a heart if you venture into it). It was later discovered that
certain trees that grew around the world contained a special substance called myrrh.

This myrrh, if placed into certain crystals, would protect the towns and cities from
the miasma. Smaller crystals were placed in villages, while large crystals were
placed into big cities. However, this myrrh is only good for a single year (which
isn't that long, when you think about it). So that year, villages and cities send
out a group of strong, adventurous youths. It is up to the to collect enough myrrh
from the trees around the world so their village can be safe for another year. Final
Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles is the story of a group of youths set out to get the
myrrh...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
STORY ANALYSIS PART TWO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the meteor crashed into the earth, the great crystal shattered, the one
guarding all the world. The miasa covered the whole world. Jump to one-hundred years
later, when monsters first starting appearing around the world. There were no
monsters until one-hundred years after the miasma struck, so there must be some
connection. Myrrh trees didn't sprout until the miasa came, signaling that again the
miasa had something to do with the trees sprouting. Even now, enemies rarely cover
the trails, and seem to only exist in areas with myrrh trees.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
STORY ANALYSIS PART THREE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A few years ago, the village of Tida was eagerly awaiting the return of their
caravan, which was supposed to return in three days. Three days passed. The caravan
did not return. The villagers of Tida still eagerly awaited the return of their
caravan, and refused to leave the village. Eventually, the crystal failed and the
miasa clamined the lives of every villager in Tida. The terrible memories that the
villagers had caused a Myrrh tree to sprout, but the forgotten memories caused the
enemy Armstrong to grow. By an astounding coincidence, Armstrong and the myrrh tree
are very close to each other.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
STORY ANALYSIS PART FOUR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There was once a boy who was collecting myrrh for his village when he decided to go
and try to stop the miasma for good. He got very far... as far as the legendary
village, Mag Mell. But he was never heard from again. Now look back to Story
Analysis Part Three. Tida's caravan never returned, and neither did the boy trying
to get rid of miasma. Put two and two together and you'll learn that the boy trying
to free the world of miasma belonged to Tida.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
STORY ANALYSIS PART FIVE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Black Knight. A strange warrior chasing the unseen light, trying to find his
memory. It is said that the Black Knight was last heard of traveling with a
preacher. He returned from the journey with no memory, and he lost everything, so he
went to chase the light. All caravanners talk about him, how he is reckless in
fighting, and how he is very dangerous.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
STORY ANALYSIS PART SIX
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a lone traveller named Gurdy, who seems to be without a caravan and travels
only with other caravanners for short amounts of time. However, his strange
personality and ways of cheating irritate the people who he is traveling with,
causing him to be gotten rid of. He seems to know a strange poem:

Lightning brings the cactus pain
Of crumed inn few reminisce
Lonely mushroom bursts to flame
Three rocks await the winter's kiss
In the end shall blooom a flower
Sacred light reveals its power.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
STORY ANALYSIS PART SEVEN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the meteor that crashed into the earth, the Meteor Parasite was born. From this
Meteor Parasite, the miasma spread and covered the earth. Also from the meteor,
Raem, the phoenix bird of memories, was born. With him was the Queen of Reflection,
Mio. Memories are what the world runs on, part of a big cycle of the world. Raem
feeds on memories. All that is remembered will eventually be forgotten. Reason being
is that Raem will eat the memories. The memories that taste the best are dreadful
ones, which is why Raem depends so much on the miasma. The miasma brings dreadful
memories, which Raem will eat. From those bad memories, monsters are born, which is
why they sprouted after the miasma came. Travellers come and collect myrrh, leaving
a few memories behind.

From these memories, myrrh sprouts, which also explains why the myrrh trees sprouted
after the miasma came. The cycle is then repeated again.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
STORY ANALYSIS PART EIGHT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Gurdy had a brother. However, this brother he had never met. Now, this brother once
tried to do an extrodinary thing: he tried to free the world of miasma. Refer back
to Story Analysis Part Four. It says that a person once tried to free the world of
miasma. If you combine this with Story Analysis Part Eight, you can figure out that
Gurdy's brother was that boy, and that Gurdy's brother was also from Tida. When
Gurdy tells you this, you'll notice that he has different clothes on, the clothes of
a preacher. These are his brothers clothes. The clothes look like a preacher's
outfit. Look at Story Analysis Part Five, the one explaining the mysterious Black
Knight. He was once hired by a preacher to serve as a bodyguard. This means that
Gurdy's brother and the Black Knight traveled together on their quest.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
STORY ANALYSIS PART NINE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once, two people known as Leon and Hurdy tried to travel into Raem's lair, the Nest
of Memories. They had almost defeated the meteor parasite, but they were stopped by
Raem right before it was gone copletely. Raem stole their memories, but was upset.
The reason he was upset is because Leon and Hurdy always looked into the future, and
didn't have that many memories with them.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
STORY ANALYSIS PART TEN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you refer back to Story Analysis Part Five, the Black Knight was chasing some
kind of light, trying to find his memory. Check Story Analysis Part Nine and you'll
learn that the two people named Leon and Hurdy were robbed of their memories when
they came through. Look at Story Analysis Part Eight, which explains that Gurdy's
brother had hired a bodyguard. Back in Story Analysis Part Nine, it mentions that
TWO people traveled into the Nest of Memories. Thus, from all this info, we can
conclude that the Black Knight once encountered Raem, who stole all of his memories,
which explains why the Black Knight is so wild and talks nonsense. We should also be
able to figure out their names, basically by how they sound. Replace the "H" in
"Hurdy" with a "G" to get "Gurdy."

It is safe to assume that Hurdy was Gurdy's brother, and Leon was the Black Knight.

And so ends the story analysis chapter, which explains much. See, I told you that
this story was a lot better than it sounded! Note that the Striped Bandits don't
have any tie in to the main plot, although at one point they do kidnap Gurdy.

Have any useful information you want to share for beating a boss or a dungeon, or
maybe one of the few sidequests in the game? Send it in! If I approve of your
information, I'll post it. Note that not everything sent it will be posted here; it
must be a useful strategy (I'll try it out myself) that can benefit for everyone.

From: Bakudan Niyakusma
Guide for: Beating the Gigas Lord
I noticed that you said that people should not use physical attacks against
the Gigas Lord. This is true, for the first 2 cycles. But, after trying
magic (with a high magic powered Yuke) on him and Maggie, I got nowhere.
(Which, this took me 3 hours) With my Yukes attack and Defence power very
low, and only one phoenix down, I took the risk of using a physical attack.

I ignored Maggie, since I kept attacking her before. And since the Gigas Lord
was doing nothing, he healed every time I attacked. So with my very weak
hammer, I swung like mad against the Gigas Lord, which kept him busy
attacking back, instead of healing. Once my health got low, I went not too
far (but far enough so I am not attacked), and casted cure. After 5 minutes
of physical attacks, he was defeated.

The best thing about this is that when you attack he moves back a little, so
half the time you're farther away from Maggie's Stop spell, which only took
effect about 5 times. Slowga wouldn't matter, since it usually does not
effect the 1-2-3 combo.

From: Noah Wonne
Guide for: Meteor Parasite and Raem
I've found some useful tips to help survive the Meteor Parasite's second and
third forms and Raem's first form.

METEOR PARASITE, ROUND 2: When it retreats into the meteor in preparation
for the laser attack, just get behind one of the bumps in the floor. If
you've already killed the plant tentacle thing nearby, you can just wait
there for the lasers to finish, then resume attacking and dodging pink
circles.

METEOR PARASITE, ROUND 3: When you see it start shooting its rapid-fire
bullets, move to a corner of the room where one of the plant tentacle things
normally respawns. They can't reach you there.

RAEM, ROUND 1: Bring any way to damage Raem from a distance (Such as magic
or a weapon with a ranged focus attack). First wipe out BOTH minions. (Yes,
both. I know what I'm doing.) Then, QUICKLY run up to Raem's face (his weak
point) before he finishes creating two more minions. Smack him around a bit,
and when he is done calling up the minions, he will notice you're right in
front of him. He'll then try his bump attack (where he moves forward a bit
to push you away). Let it knock you back, then eat some food to recover
health if your health is too low to survive another. He SHOULD try it again
repeatedly and miss every time afterward, and the minions are too far away
from you to care. (If he tries a different move after the bump attack, kill
the minions again and try the whole procedure once more, but maybe step a
tiny bit closer after he bumps you away.) Cast spells or use ranged focus
attacks from your little safety zone and watch him fall within minutes.

No special strategy for Round 2, though I'm proud to say I found out how to
change memories to ultracite on my own by accident (My stats were pretty
low, so I was healing like mad, and a memory happened to float nearby...).

Note: All of these strategies worked for a Selkie with relatively low stats
and mediocre equipment. Results may vary for other tribes and other stats.

From: Steven Zerwick
Guide for: Meteor Parasite
The reason I am sending you this email though is to share my strategy for
beating the meteor parasite...which is similar to yours except for a few
things.  First, the strategy that is used for the second phase of the battle
actually works just as well for the first one.  In fact, if you have any
agas you don't even need to get close to the tentacle.  I simply stayed up
against the wall right in the middle and moved forward and back avoiding the
poison spells, and casting blizzaga.  If you stand perfectly in the middle
the tentacles can't attack you.

On the second stage you can actually avoid the blue lasers by standing back
as far as you can as well.

Finally, on the third stage you can basically stand back as far as possible,
and avoid both the two minion tentacles and the rapid fire attack.  Simply
cast an aga spell as close as you can from the very edge of the screen and
you will hit the parasite, just watch out for the evil pink booms of the
tentacle.  I only had about 22 defense and I managed to beat the parasite
very easily with this strategy.  aga spells make a HUGE difference.  I tried
this the first time with blizzara and it drove me nuts trying to do the
third stage with the stats that I had.

-----------------------------------------------------------

From: Adam Watts
Guide for: Meteor Parasite
Phase One:
                           Keep moving! Make sure you have a cure stone or a cure
ring in your command list. You do not need to take out the plants as long as you
dodge their spells. Run up to the swinging "tentacle eye" of the miasma monster and
hit it in a 3-hit combo. QUICKLY run back out of reach of the eye, and when he tries
to slam you, do another 3 hit combo. If he lashes his tongue out at you, run away
and do a cure spell. Eventually, he will curl up in the shell of the monster and the
shell will spin. I did not notice any threat from the spinning shell, so just wait
until the eye comes back out. If you get hit by a spell, just run and cure yourself.
Make sure you dont take too much damage when combo-ing the eye. Repeat this as many
times as necessary. I used the Master's Weapon, so it should be alot easier for you
if you have the Valiant, Mighty, or Victorious weapon.

Phase two:

                            You will see a cutscene of yourself at the lower level
of the "miasma cavern".
This phase is nowhere nearly as hard as the first one. Just run up to the eye during
one of his spells and combo him. Repeat as many times as necessary. Eventually, he
will retract into the shell once again. RUN AS FAR BACKWARD AS POSSIBLE! Beams will
emit from the creatures shell which covers almost the entire radius of the area
except for the very back. This should happen
2-3 times.when he comes back out continue with the combo's and retreats. He may
retract back into the shell again, but you know what to do.  DONT FORGET TO HEAL
YOURSELF!

Phase three:

                          You will see another cutscene of yourself on the lowest
level. This is the last phase, so prepare yourself. This one is a bit harder than
the first one, but you have more room, and the flower monsters cant get you. RUN to
the back of the room as fast as you can. The monster will emit a series of
explosions within a certain radius of the front of the eye. Try to time your sprints
to the eye just right. there are 2 series of explosions before they start over
again. try to wait until the eye has finished casting a spell just as the last
explosion of that phase stops. Repeat. When the eye retracts, run to the back of the
room again. This power attack is feeble at best as long as you keep a good range and
stay out of the explosions! After the explosions are finished, repeat the afore
mentioned strategy of timing your attacks and combos. Eventually the monster will
die and you will enter a long cutscene. Beware because this is not the end of the
game. This is where those spells you gathered will come in handy.

AIM Contact
~~~~~~~~~~~

I tried, I really did, for nearly a year to allow people to IM me for questions.
However, people seem to not respect the rules. I understand that there were many
that did, and I'm sorry this had to happen, but I am moving to a closed list.
There have been many pointless IMs, including people who bash, advertising
people (0_0), spammers, and people who "wnt to maek convursashon bye tlking liek
thiz" which gets incredibly annoying. So it's only e-mail now, sorry.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
E-mail contact rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

My e-mail address is cskull@frogdesign.com. There are a few things that
you can e-mail me about, and few things that you can't. First the
things that are okay.

Information on the game. No this does NOT mean full dungeon guides,
because if it isn't there I haven't gotten to them yet but I will. It means
additional TIPS on beating a dungeon or correcting information that I messed up.
Secrets are _TOTALLY_ accepted.

Praise mail. I used to be agianst this, but now I realize how rare praise really
is. Just don't send me things like, "Yer faq is kewl, lol!!!"

Suggestions for the FAQ. Something like, "Why don't you add such and
such in your FAQ. NOT "Why don't you totally re-do your FAQ because it
sucks!" That is just plain rude and annoying. If you don't like my
FAQ, tell me things to make it better!

The things that you CAN'T e-mail me about are...

Spam. This is the NUMBER 0NE thing that you must not send. I get at least twenty
spam e-mails a day and I don't need yours it doesn'thelp. Please don't send any.

Asking permission to use this FAQ. No, you can't, so don't bother. Only four
sites, which I have listed at the top of the guide, can use this FAQ.

Hate mail. No I don't appreciate it if you send me an e-mail saying, "Your FAQ is
thebiggest piece of **** ever created! It sucks!" That just
fills up my inbox and it really annoys me.

Spelling/Grammar mistakes. I used to get about ten e-mails a day
saying, "You spelled these two words wrong." or something like, "You
used inappropriate grammar in this chapter." Please people! I can find
those on my own!

And that wraps up the contact. Once again my e-mail is:
