1. Guide
Benjamin: My village is gone!! What is going on?
Man: This place is going to sink any second! Let's climb up quick!
Man: Press the "B" Button, and jump across!

(Benjamin and Man look at a tower)
Man: Look over there. That's the Focus Tower, once the heart of the World. An
old Prophecy says, "The vile 4 will steal the Power, and divide the World
behind 4 doors. At that time the Knight will appear!" The Prophecy has now come
true. 4 monsters have locked the doors of the Focus Tower and escaped with the
keys. They're draining the light from the 4 Crystals of the Earth, and the
World is in Chaos. The people are in desperate need of help. Benjamin, only you
can save the Crystals and the world.
Benjamin: Me?
Man: Yes, you Benjamin! Only you could be the Knight spoken in the Prophecy...
(Monster appears)
Man: Look out! A monster!

(After battle)
Man: Seems I was right! At last I've found a true knight!
Benjamin: But you said you were SURE I was the one!
Man: Well, actually it was more of a guess...
Benjamin: Forget it. Just tell me where I can find the Crystals.
Man: It's up to you to find them.
(Mountain shakes)
Man: This place is becoming dangerous! Follow me to the Level Forest!
(Old Man leaves)
Benjamin: Got to get out of here. Who is that guy, any way?

(Level Forest)
Benjamin: There you are! What do you think I should do first?
Man: Save the Crystal of Earth. See you!
(Old Man leaves)

Old Man: That boulder is blocking my way back to town. Would you shove it
aside?
(After moving rock)
Old Man: Thank you! If you want to go through this forest, find Kaeli in
Foresta and show her this.

(Foresta)
Kaeli: I'm Kaeli. There's a tree blocking the north exit of the Level Forest. I
can chop down the tree, but monsters have taken over the forest, and I cannot
get to it.
Benjamin: I can help you with that. Come one, let's go!
Mother: Don't you dare take Kaeli anywhere dangerous!
Kaeli: Listen, Mom... Hey that Tree Whither looks awful! How much the trees must
be suffering OK, you win.
(Grabs Axe)
Kaeli: Don't worry, Mom.

(Level Forest)
Kaeli: Let me cut this with my Axe.
(Cuts down tree)
We've got to reach the north exit.

(North Exit of Level Forest)
Kaeli: This is the evil tree I was talking about.
Monster: Uwa ha ha! Surprise!
Kaeli: He poisoned me... Just as he d...did the t. t... trees!
(After battle)
Mother: Kaeli! What happened?
Kaeli: I'll be okay...as soon as I take Elixir...
Mother: That's in the Sand Temple.
Benjamin: Do not worry. I'll get it!
Kaeli: Then take this Axe with you...
Benjamin: I'll be back.

(Sand Temple)
Tristam: Looking for some Cure, kid?
Benjamin: First of all, my name is Benjamin, and I am looking for Elixir.
Tristam: I'll sell you some for, say 9000GP. Well?
Benjamin: Whoa! That's way to much!
Tristam: Listen kid, this stuff is precious, right?
Benjamin: My allowance is only 2GP a month!
Tristam: Then let's do it this way. I'm going to the Bone Dungeon to find
treasure. You come with me and help. If I get treasure, you get the Elixir.
Benjamin: Do I have any choice? When Do we go?
Tristam: There's a Battle field near by. Why don't you whack a few monsters
there, and maybe win something kid.
Benjamin: The name is Benjamin!

(Bone Dungeon)
Tristam: The doors are sealed shut. Well, here goes... Watch this!
(places bomb)
Aren't these something? I sell you some cheap! How about 50 Explosives for
30GP?
Benjamin: (Choose Okay or sorry.) (If you say Sorry)
Tristam: All right, I'll cut you a deal. How about 50 Explosives for 15GP?

Flamerus Rex: Grr... You'll never beat me. I have the power of the Crystal of
Earth.
(After battle)
Benjamin: Look! The Crystal!
Tristam: Never mind that, get a load of this stuff! I'll keep this. Oh, here's
what you wanted.
(Exit of Crystal room)
Tristam: Look. I've got to go. See you around, kid.
(Tristam leaves)

(Foresta)
Kaeli: Benjamin... is it really you?
Benjamin: Here's the Elixir.
Kaeli: Thank you. Now I can visit Spencer in Aquaria...
Benjamin: Why don't I go to Aquaria first and look around? Where is it?
Kaeli: It's through the Focus Tower, and to the north east.

(Focus Tower)
Man: Well done, Benjamin. Remember, Captain Mac will be crucial to your quest.
A girl named Phoebe can help you.
Benjamin: But I am going to Aquaria!
Man: Maybe you'll find her along the way...

(Libra Temple)
Benjamin: Hi!
Girl: It's hopeless, I give up... Aquaria is frozen, people are sick, Grandpa is
trapped...
(Girl starts to leave)
Benjamin: Wait, have you ever heard of a man Spencer?
Girl: Why... He's my Grandpa.
Benjamin: What luck! Let's go free him.
Girl: But we can't! I'm going home...
(Girl starts to leave again)
Benjamin: Hey! What's your name? Where are you from?
Phoebe: Oh, I am sorry. I'm Phoebe from Aquaria.
Benjamin: YOU are Phoebe? Then I'm going with you!

(Aquaria)
Benjamin: So, Phoebe, where's Spencer trapped?
Phoebe: In the tunnel he was digging under here. The dirt is frozen solid, so
he can't get out.
Benjamin: Can't we melt?
Phoebe: Not until we get Wakewater from the Spring of Life. But a monster from
in the Wintry Cave stole the Libra Crest which Warps to the Life Temple.
Benjamin: Anyway, first we have to get that whatcha-ma-call-it Crest back,
right?
Phoebe: Right! To the Wintry Cave!

(Wintry Cave, after falling)
Phoebe: This claw saved me! Here's how you use it. Select Claw, hold down A
Button, and press the control pad. Now it's yours!

(After the battle with Squidite)
Phoebe: That must be the Libra Crest! Let's take it and go to the Libra Temple.
There's a mark there that just looks like the design on the Crest. Stand on it,
and we'll be Warped to the Life Temple!

(Temple of Life)
Phoebe: That must be the Spring of Life.
(Phoebe walks over to lake, and Benjamin walks over to Phoebe)
Phoebe: It's hopeless now.
Benjamin: Don't give up yet. There's some one inside. Let's have a look.
(After looking around)
Benjamin: Aquaria's in great danger!
Man: I know that. We need Wake Water to melt the ice...
Phoebe: But the Wake Water has dried up! It's hopeless!
Man: Hear me! All that's left is in this bag. Take it and go back to Aquaria.

(Aquaria)
Phoebe: Wake water, please save our town!
(Plant turns green)
Phoebe: That's it! I guess this town will stay frozen until the Crystal of
Water shines again.
Benjamin: Then we'd better hurry to the Ice Pyramid!

(Falls Basin)
Phoebe: Let's push this out of our way.

(After battle with crab)
Phoebe: You can use Explosives, right? Here's how to use a Jumbo Bomb.

(Ice Pyramid)
Phoebe: I see a switch in the statue, but can't reach it. Let's push it with
some thing...

Ice Golem: Mwa ha! I'm enjoying our little game...

(Top of Pyramid)
Ice Golem: You think you're a Knight, huh? Fwa ha! Take this

(After battle)
Phoebe: The Crystal! I'll go back to Aquaria and see if the ice melted. Don't
forget to see Grandpa!
Benjamin: Right, bye!

(Aquaria)
Spencer: The ice has melted! How did it happen?
Benjamin: Phoebe and I restored the Crystal of Water's light.
Spencer: Then you're the Knight in the Prophecy! The shield has found it's
owner! A shield used by a Knight in days gone by. Captain Mac found it.
Benjamin: Captain Mac! I've heard that name before!
Spencer: For years Mac's been studying the Prophecy. On his way back from doing
some research the lake dried up and his ship ended up on a rock ledge. But
that's no problem. If we dig from here, we'll be able to reach the ship. Any
way here is a key. The shield is hidden in the Focus Tower. By the way,
Fireburg's been having strong earthquakes lately.

(Focus Tower)
Man: Some awful news made Captain Mac race from his home. Anyway seek Reuben in
Fire burg. Say what's this statue for?

(Fireburg)
Benjamin: You're Reuben, huh? Have you heard about the Crystal of Fire?
Reuben: I can't deal with that now. I've got to help Dad.
Benjamin: Well, why don't you let me help you!
Reuben: He's stuck behind a bolder. There'd be no problem if we had a Mega
Grenade, but only Dad's friends can use them.
Benjamin: Where's the guy's house?
Reuben: In this town, but he's shut himself in.
Benjamin: We'll pay him a visit any way. Come on!

(Fireburg Inn)
Tristam: What's up?
Benjamin: We went to the house in the pit, but the guy wouldn't let us in.
Tristam: You two want in? Then take this.

(House)
Friend: I ran when I saw the monster in the volcano. A huge boulder fell and
trapped Arion... Only a Mega Grenade can free him.
Benjamin: How do you use one?
Friend: Just throw it!
Reuben: Go trough the abandoned Mine to reach the boulder.

(Mine exit)
Reuben: We're close enough to blow up the boulder! Dad! Stand back! We did it!
Arion: Reuben.... I knew you'd save me!
Reuben: Please head home to Mom!
Arion: Right. You two be careful!
Reuben: Let's return to Fireburg.

(Sealed Temple)
Man: Do you have 10GP for a cup of coffee?

(Lava Dome)
Dual Head Hydra: It's the end of the line for you!
(After fight)
Benjamin: We did it! There's one Crystal left to go!
Reuben: I remember a person from Windia saying something about a Crystal....
Benjamin: Windia? Where's that?
Reuben: To the south east exit of Focus Tower....

(Focus Tower)
Man: Hurry to Windia, but be on the lookout for Captain Mac's ship!

(Rope Bridge)
Mummy: Gotcha!
Reuben: Stay back, Benjamin, and leave this monster to me!
(After fight)
Benjamin: Reuben!
Reuben: I'm all right! Keep going, and I'll catch up!
Tristam: Your buddy fell, kid?
Benjamin: Yes, but he's okay.
Tristam: All right, then I'll tag along with you for a bit.

(Coming soon Alive Forest)

Windia
Benjamin: Excuse me, are you Otto?
Otto: Later...

Otto: My daughter Norma went to the Tower up north using my Rainbow Road. But
the powerful wind from Mt. Gale broke the road-making machine. Norma's stuck
until the wind die down.
Kaeli: Benjamin, let's keep going. The Crystal of Wind might be in that
mountain air.

Top of Mount Gale
Benjamin: So you're the one who's draining the Crystal of Wind's power!
Dullahan: Nah, it's Pazuzu. But you'll never meet him!

Windia
Otto: The wind has suddenly stopped. I'll try to make the Rainbow Road!

Otto: It worked!
Benjamin: Otto, we're going to save Norma and the Crystal!
Otto: Wait! In the Tower, you will see switches on even-numbered floors. Flick
them with your Axe. Then the elevator won't go past that floor!

Pazuzu's Tower
Benjamin: Are you Norma?
Norma: I was afraid no one would find me, but now I can go home!
Benjamin: You Dad's waiting for you.

3F
Pazuzu: I was waiting for you, little beasts!

4F
Pazuzu: Mwa ha! You can't catch me!

2F
Pazuzu: Mwa ha! You can't catch me!

1F
Pazuzu: Playtime's over! Prepare to meet your doom! And you can forget about
Captain Mac!

Windia
Benjamin: We sill have Captain Mac to worry about. Spencer said you'd help...
(Reuben enters)
Benjamin: Reuben! Are you okay?
Reuben: Yeah! And guess what I found when I fell? A stairway to the top of the
Focus Tower!
Benjamin: Stairway?!
Otto: I've got it! If we refill the dry lake, we can save Captain Mac.
Benjamin: How?
Otto: Go to Spencer's tunnel. Set a bomb there, and the water from the Upper
Lake will spill into the dry lake!
Benjamin: But Spencer's tunnel has caved in.
Otto: There is one way... If you power up the Rainbow Road machine with Thunder
Rock, you can reach Spencer's Place!
Reuben: Dad will know about this!
Benjamin: Kaeli, will you take care of Norma? Reuben and I know the Focus Tower
well, so we'll be back from Fireburg in no time.
Kaeli: Of course.

Fireburg
Benjamin: Arion, you ever heard of Thunder Rock?
Arion: Of course! Wait a second. Here. Take it.

Windia
Otto: Found some Thunder Rock, huh?
(uses rock)
Otto: Power up completed! Now you can go to Spencer's Place!

Spencer's Place
Reuben: Let's blow that area up with a Mega Grenade.

Benjamin: We did!
Reuben: Let's tell, Kaeli.

Windia
Benjamin: It worked! The ship is afloat.
Kaeli: Thanks. I'll head there now!
Benjamin: But the ship's full of monsters. Let us go first
Kaeli: Give this Captain Cap to Dad when you find him. Then he'll know I'm
coming.

Mac's Ship
B1
Mac: Is...Isn't th...that my Captain Cap?!
Benjamin: Kaeli asked us to give it to you. Are you okay?
(Kaeli enters)
Kaeli: Dad! I was worried about you. You look awful..
Mac: I'm...okay, but I have some bad news... The Dark King... Prophecy...
Kaeli: Dad, tell us about the Prophecy later! Let's cure your wounds in Windia
first.
Mac: But...
(Kaeli and Mac leave; Reuben falls)
Reuben: I'm okay. I guess I haven't recovered from that fall off the bridge.
Benjamin: Reuben! Let's go to Windia and put you to bed!

Ship Dock
Spencer: There you are!
Benjamin: Spencer! Phoebe's been looking for you.
Spencer: I met her at the Inn in Windia, and now she wants to see you. We're
done here. Let's go!
Tristam: Right! See you again, kid!

Windia (Inn)
Benjamin: Reuben's Hurt!
Phoebe: I'm surprised you even made it here with such a bad wound! Off to bed
with you.
(Reuben leaves)
Phoebe: Benjamin, you need to hear Mac's news. You're not going to like it...

(Inn; 2F)
Benjamin: What can be so important?
Mac: I've discovered a lost part of the Prophecy. "The one behind the 4 is
darker than the night, and rises midst the land!" You've saved the Crystals,
but our real enemy is the Dark King. He's in Focus Tower. Reach the tower with
my ship, Stan by the steering wheel and press the A button.

Doom Castle
Statue: ... Benjamin, Phoebe, knights of Light... We Crystals now entrust you
with
our power.

Doom Castle
Benjamin: Dark King, we meet at last...
Dark King: Indeed, and now you will serve me...
Benjamin: I don't think so! We won't allow you to ruin our World.
Dark King: Alas, silly humans, I must share a terrible secret! That Prophecy?
Ages ago I started that rumor! Welcome to the power of Darkness!

(During battle)
Before changing to second form
Dark King: How amusing! Is that all that you can muster?

Before changing to third form
Dark King: Grrr... Now see what I really am!

Phoebe: At last! It's all over!
(Man appears)
Man: Disguised as a human I, the Crystal of Light, have guided you.

Benjamin: Thank you!

Windia
Otto: Benjamin! You say Dark King was the problem, and you beat him?!

Otto: They're fine! They've already headed home.
Benjamin: Great. Sometime I'll drop by and say "Hi!"

Foresta
Kaeli: You're safe! What are you going to do next?
Benjamin: Maybe you can answer that, Mac, how about lending me that
ship? I
need a little more adventure in my life.
(Turns to face Kaeli)
Benjamin: Don't worry, Kaeli!
Mac: Alright. But let me see if it's still seaworthy.
Mother: Don't forget your Cap again!

Aquaria
Benjamin: Spencer! You still digging?
Spencer: Yep. All because of you guys!
Benjamin: Any one seen Tristam?
Spencer: That jerk. He's gone treasure hunting again!
Benjamin: Well, tell him I said "Hi!"

Fireburg
Reuben: How's it going?
Benjamin: Reuben! Couldn't be better!
Reuben: Why don't you hang out in this town?
Benjamin: No way! I'm off for more adventure in Captain Mac's ship.
Reuben: At least let me see you off!

Ship's dock
Mac: The ship's better off then new!
Benjamin: Thanks, Mac.
Mother: Three cheers for Captain Benjamin!
Otto: Wait until you see my next invention!
Norma: Can you come over again?
Arion: Have a good trip.
Reuben's Mother: Do it up while you're young!
Reuben: I think I've had all the adventure I can stand!
Spencer: How about taking me along? You'll need an expert treasure
hunter!
Phoebe: You don't know what you're saying, Grandpa!
Phoebe: You'll be back in no time. See the World for me!
Kaeli: We're going to miss you.
Benjamin: I'm going to miss you, too. Farewell!
(Kaeli and Phoebe run up. Shows ship going off)

Deck
Benjamin: What are you doing here?
Tristam: I can't resist it when I hear about an adventure. I'm going to
