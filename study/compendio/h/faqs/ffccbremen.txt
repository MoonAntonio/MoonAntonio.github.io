[003] III. Game Information & Story
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Title:		   Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles
Publisher:	   Square-Enix
Developer:	   Square-Enix
Genre/Category:	   Role-Playing
System:		   Gamecube
Number of Players: 1-4
Release Date:	   02/09/2004
Play Time:	   20-100+ Hours

Story:

Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles is the first Final Fantasy game to make it's
return to Nintendo.
        
The basic plot is this:

Long ago, a substance called miasma covered the world of Final Fantasy:
Crystal Chronicles.  The substance called miasma is sort of like radiation.
It's invisible but permeates the air.  Prolongued contact with the miasma
begins to drain your life away until you eventually die.

However, certain crystals were found that can keep the miasma at bay.  Large
crystals are found in the center of towns to protect the entire town from
miasma.  The problem is that the crystals lose power after about a year and 
must be purified by a substance called myrrh.  Myrrh is collected from myrrh
trees.  These trees are very rare and only produce a single drop every two
years.

Thus, crystal caravans were formed.  These caravans are sent out by each town
to travel the world in search of myrrh trees.  They harvest the myrrh and
place it in a container called a crystal chalice and then bring it back to
their town to purify the crystal.

This is the story of your crystal caravan.

[009] VI. Menu System
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The [M##] is the search code for menu system ONLY.  Use it to search for a
specific menu item in this section.  Each menu item has its own information
about it what it is used for and any submenus contained within it.  Use the
search code listed next to a particular menu item to jump to that section for
it or simply scroll down to it.

The menu system in Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles is very similar to any
other RPG's you have played before.  You access the main menu by pressing
the "X" button while in a dungeon.

Here is a list of the menu items on the main menu and their appropriate
search codes:

 [M01] Command List
 [M02] Items
 [M03] Equip
 [M04] Artifacts
 [M05] Treasures
 [M06] Money
 [M07] Favorites
 [M08] Family
 [M09] Letters

[010] VII. Battle System
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Battling in Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles is somewhat different from what
you may be used to.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[011] -- Attacking -----------------------------------------------------------

Attacking in Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles is very simple.  There are
various ways to deal damage to enemies.  You can attack using your weapon or
cast spells on them.

Attacking is fairly straight-forward.  While in a dungeon, you simply select
"Attack" from your command list (top left of screen) by using the "L1" or "R1"
buttons to rotate it.  When "Attack" is highlighted, you are ready to attack.

Now simply press the "A" button to begin swinging your weapon at enemies.  By
timing your attacks correctly, you can perform a combo attack.  Try not to 
just mash the buttons but get a smooth rythm going.

You can also perform something called a "Focus" attack.  Simply hold the "A"
button down and your character will charge up.  A round target will appear
on the ground near you.  Use the Left Analog or D-Pad to move the target over
to an enemy while you are still holding "A" down.  When you get the target on
an enemy, let go of the "A" button to perform the focus attack.  This attack
is much stronger than your standard attack.

You can also attack enemies with spells.  Spells will be covered in the next
section.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[012] -- Spells --------------------------------------------------------------

There are many different spells in the game.  To use a spell you must first
find it somewhere in a dungeon.  Once you find a spell, you must then equip it
to your command list using the "Command List" option in the menu.  After you
equip it you can use it.

Casting spells is fairly straight-forward.  While in a dungeon, you simply
select the name of the spell (Fire, Gravity, etc.)  from your command list
(top left of screen) by using the "L1" or "R1" buttons to rotate it.  When
the name of the spell is highlighted, you are ready to use it.

Now, simply hold the "A" button down and your character will charge up.  A
round target will appear on the ground near you.  Use the Left Analog or D-Pad
to move the target over to an enemy while you are still holding "A" down.
When you get the target on an enemy, let go of the "A" button to cast the
spell.

To use healing spells on yourself, simply place the target on top of your
character and cast the spell.

Here is a list of all the spells in the game.

[015] VIII. Items/Equipment
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[016] -- Food ----------------------------------------------------------------

Food is used in the game to replenish your characters health, sort of like
potions in other Final Fantasy games.  Each race begins the game with likes
and dislikes for certain foods.  By feeding your character foods they do not
like, they will begin raising their likeness for that food.  If you work hard
enough at it, you can eventually have your character like all foods.  See the
section "Characters" below for information on starting food likes/dislikes
for each race.

All foods heal your character.  However, depending on your like or dislike
for a food, the effect it has may not boost your character, but actually
lower that stat for your character (temporarily).

Here is a list of all the foods in the game:

  --------------------------------------
 | Food            | Effect (Temporary) |
 |--------------------------------------|
 | Cherry Cluster  | Magic + 2          |
 | Fish            | Strength + 2       |
 | Gourd Potato    | Defense + 2        |
 | Meat            | Strength + 2       |
 | Rainbow Grapes  | Magic + 2          |
 | Round Corn      | Defense + 2        |
 | Star Carrot     | Defense + 2        |
 | Striped Apple   | Magic + 2          |

[017] -- Equipment -----------------------------------------------------------

Here is a list of all the equipment in the game:

Steel Blade
Sonic Lance
Dual Shooter
Rune Hammer

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[018] -- Materials -----------------------------------------------------------

Materials are found in dungeons throughout the game.  You use these materials
to forge new weapons and armor in the game.

Here is a list of all the materials in the game:

Iron
Bronze
Crystal Ball
Mythril

More coming soon...


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[019] -- Magicite ------------------------------------------------------------

Magicite is basically a type of magic.  You find stones inside dungeons that
are of a particular type of Magicite.  Getting one of these stones allows you
to use that type of magic during that dungeon.  When you leave the dungeon
however, you lose them all.

There are six types of Magicite in the game:

Fire
Blizzard
Thunder
Cure
Life
Clear

You can combine these types and create more powerful spells like Holy and
Gravity.  See the section "Spell Fusion (Spell Combinations)" for more
information on fusing magicite.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[020] -- Artifacts -----------------------------------------------------------

Artifacts are basically special items you find in dungeons.  As you collect
these items in a dungeon, they automatically get applied to your character.
Once you leave the dungeon however, you will lose them all.

The only way to keep an artifact PERMANENTLY, you must defeat the boss of that
dungeon.  After you defeat the boss, you will get the option to choose ONE
artifact that you have collected to keep permanently.  The artifact you choose
will stay with you for the rest of the game.

*Note: Artifacts are one time only items.  Meaning you can only get it once
       per character, per game.  An example of this is the Moogle Pocket.

*Note: Dungeons change the artifacts you receive from them dependant on when
       you go into them.  The artifacts can change every year that the drop
       of myrrh is replenished at that dungeon.  It is not based on the
       current year.  It is based on the drop of myrrh.  Everytime the drop of
       myrrh is replenished at a dungeon, the artifacts might change.  I will
       refer to this as a cycle in the table below.  Each new cycle can bring
       different artifacts.

       In other words, you can get a drop of myrrh from a dungeon, EVERY
       OTHER YEAR.  So if you got a drop of myrrh from River Belle Path in
       year 1, you could get the next drop of myrrh from River Belle Path
       during year 3.  Just add 2 to whatever year you are on when you get
       the drop of myrrh from that dungeon.

       Year 1 + 2 years = Year 3.  Not exactly 2 years the way we think
       about it, but that's basically the gist of it.


I will list all of the artifacts in the game as well as information about them
and the location where you can find it.

Here is a list of all of the artifacts in the game:

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

[021] -- Forging -------------------------------------------------------------

To forge new weapons, armor, and accessories, you must find designs for them
in dungeons.  You must also find materials for forging them like bronze and
iron.  You must then go to a Blacksmith and pay them to forge new weapons, 
armor, etc. for you.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[022] -- Crystal Chalice -----------------------------------------------------

The crystal chalice is something that you simply cannot live without.  It
forms a protective barrier around it that keeps miasma away.  Since miasma is
poisonous, you will die if you get too far away from the chalice for too long.

On the world map the chalice goes along with your caravan and you don't need
to worry about it.  However during dungeons, you must manually pick it up
and carry it around with you.

While you are holding the chalice, you cannot attack or defend.  In fact you
can't do anything other than walk around with it.

In single player you have a friend with you named Mog.  He will carry the
chalice for you.  simply drop the chalice by pressing "B".  Then press "X" to
have him pick it up.  He will carry it for a while until he gets tired.  This
doesn't mean you have to take it from him, but he will move slower and you
will eventually get frustrated because you will accidentally keep walking
outside the protective barrier since he starts lagging behind.

To fix this, simply have him drop it and carry it around until you see him
say he wants it back.  Then give it back.  Repeat this cycle as neccessary.

In multi-player, you or one of your friends has to carry it.  While this 
seems like the person carrying the chalice will get left out of the battle,
it simply isn't true.  In fact, being the person with the chalice means you
are the leader since no one can go anywhere without you.  Also, you can drop
the chalice at anytime and start fighting enemies with your friends.  Often
your friends will form a protective barrier around you to protect you while
you drop the chalice as well.  So the chalice holder is often the most
important of the bunch.

Okay, so keep the chalice with you to survive.

Now, in the world there are miasma streams.  They are basically like walls
of miasma that you can't pass through unless your chalice is the same
elemental type as the stream.  So if the stream blocking your way is "Water"
then you need to find a "Hot Spot" in a dungeon that is blue (Water) and set
the chalice down on it to change the chalice to that element.  Then you can
return to the stream and walk past it.

Once you beat a dungeon, you don't need to re-enter it to change the chalice
to a different element.  If that dungeon had a Water and Fire hot spot inside
and you finished the level, then next time you go to enter the dungeon you
will get the option to enter the dungeon, cancel, or change your chalice's
elemental type to Water or Fire from a menu that pops up.

Now, changing your chalice to a different element also has an effect on
your character.

Here are the effects based on the elemental type of the chalice:

 Water - Character resists cold
  Fire - Character resists fire
  Wind - Character resists thunder
 Earth - Character resists poison and petrification

So you want to pay attention to what elemental type your chalice is set to.
For example if you fight a lot of enemies that cast fire spells on your
characters, you may want to change the chalice to the fire type to lessen
the damage you receive from their attacks.

[025] IX. Moogle Mail
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Moogle Mail is basically just regular postal mail delivered by moogles.  
Throughout the game, your family will send you mail.  You can read the mail
and send replies along with items or money back to them.  Depending on what
you reply or send back, it will make your family happier or sadder.

[046] XI. Enemies/Bosses/Optional Bosses
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This section lists all the enemies in the game.  I have broken it up into
three subsections: Enemies, Bosses & Mini-Bosses.  The listing is in
alphabetical order.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[047] -- Enemies -------------------------------------------------------------

The [E###] is the search code for enemies ONLY.  Use it to search for specific
enemies in this section.  First I will list the enemies in the game.  Each
enemy has its own information about it such as the HP, STR, MAG, etc. Use
the search code listed next to a particular enemy to jump to that section for
it or simply scroll down to it.

Key:
        HP   = Hit/Health Points
        STR  = Strength
        DEF  = Defense
        MAG  = Magic
        WEAK = Weaknesses to be exploited

[048] -- Bosses --------------------------------------------------------------

The [B##] is the search code for bosses ONLY.  Use it to search for specific
bosses in this section.  First I will list the bosses in the game. 
Additionally, all bosses will have strategies listed on how to defeat them.
Use the search code listed next to a particular boss to jump to that section
for it or simply scroll down to it.

Here is a list of the bosses in the game and strategies for each:

           (Arranged in alphabetical order)

[B01] Armstrong                          [B06] Golem
[B02] Cave Worm                          [B07] Jack & Maggie
[B03] Dragon Zombie                      [B08] Lich
[B04] Giant Crab                         [B09] Marlboro
[B05] Goblin Mage                        [B10] Orc King

-------------------------------------------------
- [B01] -----------------------------------------

Name: Armstrong

Strategy:
        Take out the small skeletons immediately.  Once they are out of the
way start attacking Armstrong with physical focus attacks.  Just get around
behind him and attack.  Charge up your attack and unleash it.  If you have
strong magical attacks you can try to use them instead.  However, I think
physical attacks work much better.  If he summons any of the smaller
skeletons, take them out quickly and return to fighting the boss.  The key to
this battle is to keep moving at all times.  If you find yourself low on
health, just run to an open spot and heal.  This battle shouldn't be too
difficult.

                             -------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------
- [B02] -----------------------------------------

Name: Cave Worm

Strategy:
        This boss can be easy or hard depending on how you go about killing
it.  When the battle begins, take out the smaller electric enemies quickly.
Now turn your attacks to the main boss.  If you get too close to him, he
will start moving around and if you get  hit it can hurt you badly.  The
best way is to stay near him, but not too close.  I found that the best
place to stand is to the left of him about five to seven steps away.  At
this location he will keep trying to use his attack where he sucks you to
him.  When he does that, run towards him and start flailing on him. Don't
use focus attacks because they are too sloe.  Just keep pounding on him
with physical attacks.  When he stops sucking, run back to your spot.  At
that spot, you can get hit by his other attacks, but they aren't that bad.
Simply run to the back of the arena and heal yourself as needed.  Eventually
he will go down.

                             -------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------
- [B03] -----------------------------------------

Name: Dragon Zombie

Strategy:
        This boss can be easy or hard depending on how you go about killing
it.  I recommend having the following things equipped to your command list.
Have Cure, Phoenix Down, and Holy.  When the battle begins, take out the
smaller enemy quickly. Now turn your attacks to the main boss.  You cannot
physically attack this boss so you have to rely on magic.  Holy is the best
spell to use on him becasue it does damage regardless of if he is invisible
or not.  Just keep casting Holy on him and you will take him out easily.
Heal as needed by running to one of the sides all the way over and then heal.
Take out any smaller enemies he summons as fast as possible with physical
attacks.  Continue using this strategy until he goes down.

                             -------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------
- [B04] -----------------------------------------

Name: Giant Crab

Strategy:
        This boss isn't too difficult.  Just avoid the electric ball he sends
out and get around behind him and attack.  He also uses his claw to attack you
physically.  Just watch his pattern and avoid it.  I would suggest combining
your Blizzard magic together and using Blizzara on him.  It will only take
about 10 Blizzara spells to defeat him.  If you don't have Blizzard, try
Fusing Life and Thunder together to create Holy and use that on him.  If you
don't have anything good to fuse a spell together with, just use standard
spells or get around behind him and attack him with your weapon.  Remember to
heal often and try to keep a Phoenix Down equipped in case you die.

                             -------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------
- [B05] -----------------------------------------

Name: Goblin Mage

Strategy:
        Take out the small goblins immediately.  Once they are out of the way
start attacking the main Golbin Mage with physical focus attacks.  Just get
around behind him and attack.  Wait until he starts casting and move around
behind him.  Then charge up your attack and unleash it.  If you have strong
magical attacks you can try to use them instead.  However, I think physical
attacks work much better.  If he summons any of the smaller goblins, take 
them out quickly and return to fighting the boss.  The key to this battle is
to keep moving at all times.

                             -------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------
- [B06] -----------------------------------------

Name: Golem

Strategy:
        As soon as the battle begins, take out the two flans as quickly as
possible.  Once you have them out of the way, attack the main boss.  If he
casts slow on you, either wait until it wears off or use a Clear spell to get
rid of it.  Use fruits, vegetables, or Cure spells to heal yourself if you
need to.  Get around behind Golem and use physical attacks.  Eventually he
will go down.

                             -------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------
- [B07] -----------------------------------------

Name: Jack (Gigas Master) & Maggie (Lamia Wife)

Strategy:
        At the start of the battle, run up to Jack and hit him once.  This 
will trigger a scene where Maggie comes out to help Jack.  Once she appears
focus all your attacks on her until she is defeated.  You will know she is
defeated when you see her go to the bottom left door of the house and sits
there the rest of the battle.  Don't worry if you don't see a health bar when
you attack Maggie, she doesn't have one, but eventually you will defeat her.
Now that she is out of the way, turn all your attacks towards Jack.  

Try to get behind Jack and attack him.  Eventually he will go down.
 
                             -------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------
- [B08] -----------------------------------------

Name: Lich

Strategy:
        This boss can be impossible if you do not have the proper spells.  
First of all you will need the spell Holy.  If you do not have it, then give
up.  Next you will need Cure or some healing items.

At the start of the battle, take out the small skeleton goon.  Then head over
to the two orbs, one on the right and one on the left, and hit them with a
spell like Fire, Thunder, Blizzard, etc.  Once the barrier is removed from
both orbs, you will be able to attack the main boss.

Now use Holy on the boss to make him visible.  Once he is visible, get close
to him and start hacking away at him with your sword.  Eventually, the
barriers will go back up around the orbs.  He will be invulnerable during
this time.  Hit the orbs with spells again and take out any small goons and
then use Holy again on the boss.  Then use physical attacks.  Use healing
spells/items as needed.

Repeat this process until he is destroyed.

                             -------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------
- [B09] -----------------------------------------

Name: Marlboro

Strategy:
        This boss isn't too difficult.  Just avoid the tentacles that come out
of the ground.  Equip Fire, Cure, and Clear in your command list.  Use Fire to
attack the Marlboro.  Use Cure to heal yourself when you get low on health.
Use Clear to remove any status effects it might inflict on you.  If you find
yourself low on health, simply run all the way down and away from the Marlboro
and heal yourself.  If any of the smaller plants popup, take them out first.

                             -------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------
- [B10] -----------------------------------------

Name: Orc King

Strategy:
        This boss isn't too difficult.  Equip 2 Blizzard's to get Blizzara if
you have it.  Also equip a Cure and a Clear.  Avoid the Orc King by staying
outside his reach.  He will mostly cast a fire spell that you can avoid and
while he is casting it, simply cast Blizzara on him.  If he summons a smaller
orc, take it out first and then focus on the Orc King.  If you get too close
to him he will either perform a spinning attack or try to smash you with his
hammer.  These two physical attacks are fairly weak.  Just stay at a distance
and keep casting spells on him.

Evenutally he will put a yellow colored barrier around himself. This is his
final move.  Heal yourself immediately and run as far away from him as you can
get.  He will then blow up and deal a good amount of damage to your character
before he dies.

[050] XIII. World Map
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This section contains the entire world map of Final Fantasy: Crystal
Chronicles.  The map begins at the very bottom where you start the game.
Scroll down to the bottom of the map and find the town of Tipa and you will
see the label "(Start)" denoting this is where you start the game.

Under each dungeon you will see elements in parenthesis like (Fire, Water).  
This will tell you what elemental hot spots each dungeon contains, so you
can use them to change your chalice quickly into the element you need to 
travel through the Miasma Streams.

Notice that under the Miasma Streams you will see a code (EL##).  This code
refers to the chart below that describes what elemental property the stream
has depending on what year it is.  The element of the stream changes every
year so use the chart to see what element you need to change your chalice to
to get past it.

[100] XIII. Walkthrough
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
This is the walkthrough section of this FAQ.  I will attempt to avoid spoiling
the game when I can.  The game is broken down into several sections by year,
however each year contains multiple missions. This section will concentrate on
going full out in the game. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[101] Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you begin the game you will get an introductory scene telling you about
the world in which the game takes place.  You will have to create a name for
your town.  For the walkthrough I will use the default town name of "Tipa".
Press the "Start" button when after you create your name.

You will then get a screen with a diary on it.  When you are finished reading
it press "A" to exit.

You will then be shown five different options.  You can press left ot right to
rotate the options around.

Here are the five options:

Diary - This is a book that records all the information from your adventures.

Save Game - This is where you save the game.

Options - This screen allows you to change all of your options.

Bring a Friend - This allows you to import a character into your game from a
                 memory card.

Set Out - This is where you create/select a character to play the game as.


Choose "Set Out" and you will be asked to create a character.  Choose a slot
and create a character.  See the section "Characters" above for information on
the differences on the races and trades.

After you create a character the game will automatically jump you into a
scene with your character leaving home in search of myrrh.

The basic plot of the game is this:

Long ago, a substance called miasma covered the world of Final Fantasy:
Crystal Chronicles.  The substance called miasma is sort of like radiation.
It's invisible but permeates the air.  Prolongued contact with the miasma
begins to drain your life away until you eventually die.

However, certain crystals were found that can keep the miasma at bay.  Large
crystals are found in the center of towns to protect the entire town from
miasma.  The problem is that the crystals lose power after about a year and 
must be purified by a substance called myrrh.  Myrrh is collected from myrrh
trees.  These trees are very rare and only produce a single drop every two
years.

Thus, crystal caravans were formed.  These caravans are sent out by each town
to travel the world in search of myrrh trees.  They harvest the myrrh and
place it in a container called a crystal chalice and then bring it back to
their town to purify the crystal.

This is the story of your crystal caravan.

The game progresses in years.  After you gather 3 drops of myrrh, the game
will advance by 1 year.  The only way to get a drop of myrrh is to complete
a dungeon.  Once you complete a dungeon you will get 1 drop of myrrh from the
myrrh tree there.  However, once you get a drop from that dungeon/tree, you
cannot get another drop from that dungeon/tree for another 2 years because it
takes two years for the tree to replenish (grow) a new drop of myrrh.

So you can go back inside and complete that dungeon 100 times during that
same year and never get another drop of myrrh.  Once you have advanced the
game 2 years, you can go back into that dungeon and get another drop of myrrh
from it.  

In other words, you can get a drop of myrrh from a dungeon, EVERY OTHER YEAR.
So if you got a drop of myrrh from River Belle Path in year 1, you could get
the next drop of myrrh from River Belle Path during year 3.  Just add 2 to
whatever year you are on when you get the drop of myrrh from that dungeon.

Year 1 + 2 years = Year 3.  Not exactly 2 years the way we think about it,
but that's basically the gist of it.

I will refer to this as a cycle.  Basically a new cycle begins in a dungeon
once the myrrh drop replenishes.  So at the start of the game, the first
dungeon you go into will be on cycle 1 and stays on cycle 1 until you beat
the dungeon and then wait two years.  Then when you enter the dungeon after
two years, the myrrh drop will be replenished and you will be on cycle 2 for
that dungeon.  As cycles advance in dungeons, some items you get may change
and the enemies/bosses may get harder.

So you see, each dungeon has cycles.  Cycles aren't the same as years.  Keep
this in mind as you play through the game.

Now, throughout the game there are certain random events that happen while
traveling along the roads in your caravan.  Basically, your caravan will stop
and shake on the road just like when you enter a town or something, however it
happens on the road where there is no town.  It will then jump you into a 
little side story of sorts and usually adds a page to your diary.  Sometimes
the events ask you for input as to what you want to do.  Since these events 
are random, I will not list them in the walkthrough section of the FAQ.
Instead I will list them all in the "Random Caravan Side Events" section of
this FAQ.

[102] -- Tipa ----------------------------------------------------------------

Enter Tipa and walk around to see what your hometown looks like.  You can
create up to 8 characters of different trades in the game.  Each one will
occupy a slot in the town.  If you haven't created a character of that trade
yet, a moogle will be at the house and tell you nobody is home.

Here is a map of Tipa:

Find the large crystal in the center of the town and walk around behind it.
You will see the word "Examine" come up on your screen.  Examine the area and
you will find an entrance.  Go inside.  This is a moogle house.  Inside you
will find a moogle that will initiate a sidequest in the game to go around
and find all the moogle houses and get a stamp from each on your moogle card.
Have him stamp your card.

You can also paint your moogle here as well.  See the sections on Moogle
Stamps and Moogle Painting for more information.

Now head all the way to the far left side of the town and go all the way up
the long path.  Near the top of the path that dead ends, search around until
you see "Examine" popup on the screen.  Examine the area to get a SECRET
item.  I will refer to this as a SECRET item in the game so you know when you
come across one.  The SECRET items in the game replenish themselves everytime
you complete a dungeon.  This gives you incentive to recheck this spot to get
a new SECRET item everytime.  Sometimes the SECRET item is of little value
like a seed or something.  However, occasionally you will get something really
good.

For the remainder of the walkthrough I will use the following text to remind
you to go get the secret items after completing a dungeon:

GO COLLECT ALL SECRET ITEMS FROM TOWNS.

So when you see it, you need to go and collect them all each time from all
the towns you currently have access to.

When you are done exploring, leave the town and take your caravan up on the
world map.

You will get a scene with some people and you will meet Mog and another
moogle.  This will jump you into a tutorial.  Go through the tutorial and exit
when you are finished.

[104] -- Port Tipa -----------------------------------------------------------

Head to the left and enter Port Tipa.  Head down the path to find a cave
entrance.  Go inside and speak to the moogle to get another stamp.

Leave the cave and if you head down the path you will see a familiar area. 
This is where you were during the tutorial.  You can view the tutorial again
as well as change your chalice to the water elemental.  When you are ready to
go, leave Port Tipa.

[105] -- River Belle Path ----------------------------------------------------

Here is where the real part of the game begins.  Head down and to the right
on the world map and enter River Belle Path.  After a brief introduction, you
will have control back.

Here is a map of River Belle Path:

                  To World Map                                                 


Enter River Belle Path and upon your entry to a dungeon you will always be
prompted to setup your command list.  Press the "Y" button to do this.  When
you are ready, exit the menu and press the "A" button to start the level.

To your right will be a raised drawbridge.  To lower it, simply drop the
chalice on one of the square switches on the ground and then go over and
stand on the other one at the same time and it will lower.  However you will
notice that the other side is still up so you can't get across.  In essence,
lowering either side of the bridge is pretty pointless so you might as well
ignore it.  It's a shortcut back from the other side, however you won't have
a need to come back.

Instead, go to the left and follow up the map over to the "B".  Kill any
enemies along the way.  Once you get to the "B" (Blue Water Hot Spot), drop
your chalice on it to change it's elemental type to water.  You will need it
to be water to get into the next area of the game later on.

Now go down on the map and grab the "Stone of Cure" from the treasure chest.
This will make things easier now that you can heal yourself easily without
wasting any food.  Also, if you picked up a "plume of phoenix (Phoenix Down)
after defeating any enemies, go into your command list and equip it.  By 
adding one to your command list, it will automatically get used and revive
you if you die.

Now head on up to the gate blocking the bridge and kill the enemy there.
Anytime you see a gate blocking your path, there should be an enemy nearby.
When you kill that enemy, it will drop a round key that fits on top of the
pedestal near the gate.  Pick up the key and drop it onto the pedestal to
open the gate.

Now, use the map to explore the area and grab all the treasures.  Make sure
you go to the "C" marked on the map.  It initially looks like a wall but
when you get close to it you will see "Examine" popup in the screen.  Examine
the wall to reveal a cave opening.  Go inside and get your moogle stamp.

Come back outside and follow the map and grab all the treasures in the entire
area.  Make sure you always kill all of the enemies in an area because you get
some great items from them.

When you are ready, go to the small path that goes off the top of the screen
(marked "To Boss") on the map, and you will encounter your first boss in the
game.


-- Boss Battle --
Name: Giant Crab

Strategy:
        This boss isn't too difficult.  Just avoid the electric ball he sends
out and get around behind him and attack.  He also uses his claw to attack you
physically.  Just watch his pattern and avoid it.  I would suggest combining
your Blizzard magic together and using Blizzara on him.  It will only take
about 10 Blizzara spells to defeat him.  If you don't have Blizzard, try
Fusing Life and Thunder together to create Holy and use that on him.  If you
don't have anything good to fuse a spell together with, just use standard
spells or get around behind him and attack him with your weapon.  Remember to
heal often and try to keep a Phoenix Down equipped in case you die.
 
--

You will receive your first drop of myrrh.

It takes three drops of myrrh to protect your village and advance to the next
year.  You will also get the option to read your new mail and send something
back to your family.  Send them something depending on what trade your family
is. 

You will also get the option of choosing which artifact you want to keep.  I
would suggest keeping the "Moogle Pocket" so you can permanently keep an
additional slot in your command list.

Now, you can go back through River Belle Path as many times as you want and
keep getting money, artifacts, etc.  It's up to you.  However you can only get
one of each artifact.

GO COLLECT ALL SECRET ITEMS FROM TOWNS.

[106] -- The Miasma Stream (water) -------------------------------------------

When you are ready, head up to The Miasma Stream (Water) at the top of the
world map and go inside.  Once in the Miasma Stream, you will notice that you
must carry the chalice yourself, Mog will not be there to help.  Simply carry
the chalice to the other side of the path and exit.  You will then be on a 
new area of the world map.  Our next stop is up the path to Marr's Pass.

Marr's Pass is a crossroads and central hub of this area.  You can choose to
enter Marr's Pass and travel to the left or right and exit it to continue
along the path.  Or simply move your caravan over top of it and pass it up
without entering it.

Head inside Marr's Pass and on the left side of the main path is a well.  When
the "Examine" pops up on the screen, examine the well.  This will give you a 
SECRET Item.

Now along the left side of the town you will also find some wooden steps
leading down.  Go down the steps and examine the hole in the wall to go
inside.  Talk to the moogle there and get your card stamped.

Make your way along to the map and grab the five treasure chests.  To the right
of treasure 5 is a the moogle house.  Search along the right side of that area
and when the "Examine" pops up, press "A" and go inside to grab another stamp.

Make sure you always kill all of the enemies in an area because you get some
great items from them like Iron.

Now head to the top of the screen to come across your next boss battle.


-- Boss Battle --
Name: Marlboro

Strategy:
        This boss isn't too difficult.  Just avoid the tentacles that come out
of the ground.  Equip Fire, Cure, and Clear in your command list.  Use Fire to
attack the Marlboro.  Use Cure to heal yourself when you get low on health.
Use Clear to remove any status effects it might inflict on you.  If you find
yourself low on health, simply run all the way down and away from the Marlboro
and heal yourself.  If any of the smaller plants popup, take them out first.
 
--

You will receive your second drop of myrrh.

After you defeat the Marlboro, you will get the option to read your new mail
and send something back to your family.  Send them something depending on what
trade your family is.  You will also get the option of choosing which artifact
you want to keep.  I would suggest keeping the "Earth Pendant" so you can
permanently gain an extra heart for your life gauge.

GO COLLECT ALL SECRET ITEMS FROM TOWNS.

Now, before we head to The Mine of Cathuriges and the end of year 1, let's go
forge some new weapons and armor.  Head all the way back on the world map to
your home town (Tipa).  Talk to the Blacksmith there and forge yourself a 
Novice's Weapon (Iron Sword if you are a Clavat), an Iron Shield, and some
Bronze Armor.  If you are a different race you can also forge an accessory
like a pair of gloves.  If you don't have enough Iron then you can either buy
some from a merchant or go get more at The Mushroom Forest.  It's up to you
but I prefer finding them versus buying them since they cost so much money
to buy.

When you are ready to go, head back and enter The Mine of Cathuriges.

Make your way along the dungeon.  You will find that where the "||" is on the
map above, you are blocked.  To get past this, simply go over to the mine
cart, (MC) on the map and hit it with your weapon from behind.  It will crash
through the rocks and open a path.  You basically need to continue using the
mine cart to break down any barriers along the way.  Occasionally you will
have to hit a switch so the mine cart follows the correct tracks.  On the map
above I have an [X] on the correct switch you should hit to make the mine cart
go the correct way.


If you hit the mine cart to the wrong path, simply go back to where the mine
cart was and try again after switching the mine cart tracks.

Near the end of the dungeon is a track off to the left of the screen.  Follow
it over to find a small opening.  You will get an "Examine" popup on the
screen.  Examine the area to find a moogle house and go inside to grab another
stamp.

Now head on up to the boss.

-- Boss Battle --
Name: Orc King

Strategy:
        This boss isn't too difficult.  Equip 2 Blizzard's to get Blizzara if
you have it.  Also equip a Cure and a Clear.  Avoid the Orc King by staying
outside his reach.  He will mostly cast a fire spell that you can avoid and
while he is casting it, simply cast Blizzara on him.  If he summons a smaller
orc, take it out first and then focus on the Orc King.  If you get too close
to him he will either perform a spinning attack or try to smash you with his
hammer.  These two physical attacks are fairly weak.  Just stay at a distance
and keep casting spells on him.

Evenutally he will put a yellow colored barrier around himself. This is his
final move.  Heal yourself immediately and run as far away from him as you can
get.  He will then blow up and deal a good amount of damage to your character
before he dies.

You can also try and defeat him before he blows up.  Simply run up to him and
start flailing wildly.  If you are strong enough, he will die before he has
a chance to self-destruct.
 
--

You will receive your third drop of myrrh.

After you defeat the Orc King, you will get the option to read your new mail
and send something back to your family.  Send them something depending on what
trade your family is.  You will also get the option of choosing which artifact
you want to keep.

Upon completing The Mine of Cathuriges, you will conclude year 1.  You will
see a long scene showing the myrrh ceremony revitalizing the crystal and a
celebration.  During the scene all of the diary entries you gathered during
your first year will be displayed.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[111] Year 2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's a new year and it's time to set off again in search of three more drops
of myrrh.  Since it takes two years for myrrh trees to replenish (every other
year), we cannot visit the three places we did in year one to collect myrrh.
You can still go there and get items and artifacts, but not myrrh.

Before you set off, go and find your family and talk to them.  Hopefully they
will give you something like money, fruits & vegetables, etc.

GO COLLECT ALL SECRET ITEMS FROM TOWNS.

If you want to you can shop around and talk to people.  When you are ready, 
exit the town.

Upon exiting you will be stopped by the town elders.  Roland will talk to you
about your destiny and send you on your way.

On the world map, head up the path toward the Goblin Wall.  the Goblin Wall
was previously unavailable to you, but should be open now.  Along the way you
will be stopped by a scene with 3 Lilties by the names of Rolf Wood, Leuts
Royce, and Lynne Doff.  They will tell you they challenged the Black Knight
and got beaten.

Upon entering the Goblin Wall, you will get a brief introduction.

Make your way along the dungeon.  To open the gates blocking you or covering
treasure chests, you will need to get above the gate and hit the skull switch
for each one.

On the map above where the "M" is, you will need to open that gate and then
enter the alcove and go to the back left corner of it.  You will get an
"Examine" on the screen.  Press "A" and go inside to grab another stamp.

Also, you will come to some skull switches above what looks like cave openings
blocked by boulders.  These switches do not work and you cannot open the 
boulder openings.  These will open up later in the game so ignore them for
now.  You will also notice an area on the right of the Goblin Wall that you
cannot get to along with a treasure chest you cannot get to.  Ignore that for
now since you cannot get it until later in the game when the boulder doors
open up.

Just keep climbing up the Goblin Wall and grabbing all the items from the
treasure chests.  Eventually you will get to the top where there is an iris
door with a pedestal near it.  Take out the enemies there and grab the key
to open it up.  Head on inside for your next boss battle.


-- Boss Battle --
Name: Goblin Mage

Strategy:
        Take out the small goblins immediately.  Once they are out of the way
start attacking the main Golbin Mage with physical focus attacks.  Just get
around behind him and attack.  Wait until he starts casting and move around
behind him.  Then charge up your attack and unleash it.  If you have strong
magical attacks you can try to use them instead.  However, I think physical
attacks work much better.  If he summons any of the smaller goblins, take 
them out quickly and return to fighting the boss.  The key to this battle is
to keep moving at all times.
 
--

You will receive your first drop of myrrh for year 2.

After you defeat the Goblin Mage, you will get the option to read your new mail
and send something back to your family.  Send them something depending on what
trade your family is.  You will also get the option of choosing which artifact
you want to keep.

GO COLLECT ALL SECRET ITEMS FROM TOWNS.

Return to the Goblin Wall and use the menu to change your chalice to the Fire
elemental.  Now head through the Miasma Stream.  Once you reach Ironmine Downs
head to The Mushroom Forest and change your chalice to the water element.
Then head to the Miasma Stream and go through to the other side.

Upon reaching this new area called the Vale of Alfitaria, head up the path to
Alfitaria.  Enter the town and head to the right after crossing the bridge.
Find the steps leading down on the right side of the town and go down them.  At
the bottom, follow the path all the way to the left to find an "Examine"
popup.  Examine the area to find a moogle house.  Enter it and grab another
stamp.

Now leave and head back up the steps.  Now go all the way to the left side of
the town and when you find some stairs leading up, go to the left side of them
and search around.  You will find another SECRET Item.

When you are ready, exit the town and head up to Tida.

Make your way along the ruined town of Tida.  Use Fire spells on the plants
that block your way to make them go away long enough for you to pass through.
If you have Fira or Firaga, cast it on the plants to make them permanently go
away.

If you see a pedestal underneath some vines, simply torch them with a Fire
spell to uncover the pedestal.

Find the "M" on the map and go inside the hole in the house to grab another
stamp.

Now follow the path along and eventually you will reach the next boss.

-- Boss Battle --
Name: Armstrong

Strategy:
        Take out the small skeletons immediately.  Once they are out of the
way start attacking Armstrong with physical focus attacks.  Just get around
behind him and attack.  Charge up your attack and unleash it.  If you have
strong magical attacks you can try to use them instead.  However, I think
physical attacks work much better.  If he summons any of the smaller
skeletons, take them out quickly and return to fighting the boss.  The key to
this battle is to keep moving at all times.  If you find yourself low on
health, just run to an open spot and heal.  This battle shouldn't be too
difficult.
 
--

You will receive your second drop of myrrh for year 2.

After you defeat Armstrong, you will get the option to read your new mail and
send something back to your family.  Send them something depending on what
trade your family is.  You will also get the option of choosing which artifact
you want to keep.  I would suggest choosing the Chocobo Pocket if you got one
to permanently increase your command slots.

GO COLLECT ALL SECRET ITEMS FROM TOWNS.

[115] -- Shella --------------------------------------------------------------

Now, change your chalice element to Earth using the menu at Tida and go
through the Miasma Stream over to Veo Lu.  Follow the path over to the left
to find the town of Shella.  You will be greeted and told that you cannot
enter the town unless you have the Mark of Shella.  When you leave the town
your diary will also be updated.

Now, to get the Mark of Shella enter Veo Lu Sluice and kill all the enemies
that you can access for now.  One of the enemies will drop a Mark of Shella
that you can use to enter Shella.  Once you have the Mark of Shella, simply
exit Veo Lu Sluice and return to Shella.  Give the Mark of Shella to the 
person standing near the entrance and he will create a bridge for you to
cross.

Note: Once you use the Mark of Shella, it is gone forever.  To get another
      one, you can buy one from a merchant in town, or find another one in
      Veo Lu Sluice.  I suggest buying a couple from the merchant before
      leaving the town.

Here is a map of Shella:

                                  To World Map                                 


In order to open doors, simply stand on one of the pads in front of the door
and once the glyph changes to the same symbol that represents your characters
race (Clavat, Lilty, Yuke, or Selkie), the door will open.

To get to the boss you simply need to go through the house and find and kill
all 10 of the Tonberry's.  Use the map above to find all 10 of them and take
them out.  I recommend starting with the bottom left hand corner room and
going clockwise around the house until you have gotten them all.  That way you
will only have to go into each room once and you will get all the treasures.

Find the "M" Moogle House in the room on the left of the house under the large
table and go inside to get your next stamp.

Make your way through the manor until you reach the next boss.

-- Boss Battle --
Name: Jack (Gigas Master) & Maggie (Lamia Wife)

Strategy:
        At the start of the battle, run up to Jack and hit him once.  This 
will trigger a scene where Maggie comes out to help Jack.  Once she appears
focus all your attacks on her until she is defeated.  You will know she is
defeated when you see her go to the bottom left door of the house and sits
there the rest of the battle.  Don't worry if you don't see a health bar when
you attack Maggie, she doesn't have one, but eventually you will defeat her.
Now that she is out of the way, turn all your attacks towards Jack.  

Try to get behind Jack and attack him.  Eventually he will go down.
 
--

You will receive your third drop of myrrh for year 2.

After you defeat Jack & Maggie, you will get the option to read your new mail
and send something back to your family.  Send them something depending on what
trade your family is.  You will also get the option of choosing which artifact
you want to keep.

Upon completing The Moschet Manor, you will conclude year 2.  You will
see a long scene showing the myrrh ceremony revitalizing the crystal and a
celebration.  During the scene all of the diary entries you gathered during
your first year will be displayed.  You can choose to skip them if you want
and it will not affect the game.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[117] Year 3
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's a new year and it's time to set off again in search of three more drops
of myrrh.  Since it takes two years for myrrh trees to replenish (every other
year), we cannot visit the three places we did in year two to collect myrrh.
You can still go there and get items and artifacts, but not myrrh.

Before you set off, go and find your family and talk to them.  Hopefully they
will give you something like money, fruits & vegetables, etc.

GO COLLECT ALL SECRET ITEMS FROM TOWNS.

If you want to you can shop around and talk to people.  When you are ready, 
exit the town.

Upon exiting you will be stopped by the town elders.  Roland will talk to you
about your destiny and send you on your way.

On the world map, head up to River Belle Path and change your element to Wind.
Head through the Miasma stream and go to The Mine of Cathuriges and change
your chalice element to Fire and go through the next miasma stream.  Now go to
Moschet Manor and change your chalice element to Water and go through the
miasma stream to Veo Lu.  Now head over to Veo Lu Sluice.

Upon entering Veo Lu Sluice, you will get a brief introduction.

Make your way through Veo Lu Sluice to the end boss and take him out.

-- Boss Battle --
Name: Golem

Strategy:
        As soon as the battle begins, take out the two flans as quickly as
possible.  Once you have them out of the way, attack the main boss.  If he
casts slow on you, either wait until it wears off or use a Clear spell to get
rid of it.  Use fruits, vegetables, or Cure spells to heal yourself if you
need to.  Get around behind Golem and use physical attacks.  Eventually he
will go down.

You will receive your first drop of myrrh for year 3.

After you defeat the boss, you will get the option to read your new mail
and send something back to your family.  Send them something depending on what
trade your family is.  You will also get the option of choosing which artifact
you want to keep.

To get to the boss, you need to find the two enemies in the level that have
the two pedestal keys.  They are randomly placed somewhere in the level so you
just need to kill all the enemies until you find them.  Once you get the keys,
simply take them back to the two pedestals and place them on them to open the
gate to the boss.  You don't have to enter it yet though, only when you are
ready.  You will encounter ghost type enemies in this dungeon.  Simply cast
Holy on them to make them visible and then hit them with physical attacks.
This will make them MUCH easier to kill.

Make sure you get the moogle stamp from inside the moogle house.  It's located
to the left of the main building, under the bridge.

When you are ready, head inside the main building to face your next boss.

-- Boss Battle --
Name: Lizardman King

Strategy:
        This guy is pretty easy.  When the battle begins, take out the smaller
enemies, the Coeurls and Lizardmen.  Once they are out of the way, focus on the
Lizardman King.  You can easily avoid his attacks and just keep running around
behind him.  There are also switch pads in the area that you can step on if you
want to.  They will activate saw blades in the ground that will come out and
hit anything that walks on them.  The damage they take away is minimal so I 
wouldn't waste time with it.  Just get around behind the boss and flail away.
It shouldn't be too difficult to take him out.
 
--

You will receive your second drop of myrrh for year 3.

After you defeat the boss, you will get the option to read your new mail
and send something back to your family.  Send them something depending on what
trade your family is.  You will also get the option of choosing which artifact
you want to keep.

GO COLLECT ALL SECRET ITEMS FROM TOWNS.

Make your way through Selepation Cave grabbing all the treasure chests.  When
you come to two purple tubes near a gate, simply hit them both at the same
time with one focus attack and they will open the gate.  To operate bridges
simply step on them and make sure Mog is completely on it with you.  Sometimes
I push him in.  Get to the top level and grab the moogle stamp from another
moogle house.  Now make your way through the caves to the next boss.

-- Boss Battle --
Name: Cave Worm

Strategy:
        This boss can be easy or hard depending on how you go about killing
it.  When the battle begins, take out the smaller electric enemies quickly.
Now turn your attacks to the main boss.  If you get too close to him, he
will start moving around and if you get  hit it can hurt you badly.  The
best way is to stay near him, but not too close.  I found that the best
place to stand is to the left of him about five to seven steps away.  At
this location he will keep trying to use his attack where he sucks you to
him.  When he does that, run towards him and start flailing on him. Don't
use focus attacks because they are too sloe.  Just keep pounding on him
with physical attacks.  When he stops sucking, run back to your spot.  At
that spot, you can get hit by his other attacks, but they aren't that bad.
Simply run to the back of the arena and heal yourself as needed.  Eventually
he will go down.
 
--

You will receive your third drop of myrrh for year 3.

After you defeat the boss, you will get the option to read your new mail
and send something back to your family.  Send them something depending on what
trade your family is.  You will also get the option of choosing which artifact
you want to keep.

Upon completing The Selepation Cave, you will conclude year 3.  You will
see a long scene showing the myrrh ceremony revitalizing the crystal and a
celebration.  During the scene all of the diary entries you gathered during
your first year will be displayed.  You can choose to skip them if you want
and it will not affect the game.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[123] Year 4
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's a new year and it's time to set off again in search of three more drops
of myrrh.  Since it takes two years for myrrh trees to replenish (every other
year), we cannot visit the three places we did in year three to collect myrrh.
You can still go there and get items and artifacts, but not myrrh.

Before you set off, go and find your family and talk to them.  Hopefully they
will give you something like money, fruits & vegetables, etc.

GO COLLECT ALL SECRET ITEMS FROM TOWNS.

If you want to you can shop around and talk to people.  When you are ready, 
exit the town.

Upon exiting you will be stopped by the town elders.  Roland will talk to you
about a young scholar who got help from a renowned knight.

On the world map, head up to the Goblin Wall and change your element to Earth.
Now head through the Miasma stream to the next area.  Now head over to the
Mushroom Forest and change your element to Water.  

Note:  When you change your element to water you will be cut off from your
       home town of Tipa until the next year!  So make sure you get what you
       need from there before you change it!  There is no way to get your
       element back to earth.

Now head over to Jegon River and take the boat across to the other side.  Then
go over to the next Miasma stream (water) and pass through to the next area
called Rebena Plains.

Now let's go to Conall Curach.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[124] -- Conall Curach -------------------------------------------------------

Upon entering Conall Curach, you will get a brief introduction.

Here is a map of Conall Curach:

Coming Soon...

Make your way through Conall Curach grabbing all the treasure chests.
You will encounter ghost type enemies in this dungeon.  Simply cast Holy on
them to make them visible and then hit them with physical attacks. This will
make them MUCH easier to kill.  Make your way through the marsh to the next
boss.

-- Boss Battle --
Name: Dragon Zombie

Strategy:
        This boss can be easy or hard depending on how you go about killing
it.  I recommend having the following things equipped to your command list.
Have Cure, Phoenix Down, and Holy.  When the battle begins, take out the
smaller enemy quickly. Now turn your attacks to the main boss.  You cannot
physically attack this boss so you have to rely on magic.  Holy is the best
spell to use on him becasue it does damage regardless of if he is invisible
or not.  Just keep casting Holy on him and you will take him out easily.
Heal as needed by running to one of the sides all the way over and then heal.
Take out any smaller enemies he summons as fast as possible with physical
attacks.  Continue using this strategy until he goes down.
 
--

You will receive your first drop of myrrh for year 4.

After you defeat the boss, you will get the option to read your new mail
and send something back to your family.  Send them something depending on what
trade your family is.  You will also get the option of choosing which artifact
you want to keep.

Upon entering Rebena Te Ra, you will get a brief introduction.

Here is a map of Rebena Te Ra:

Coming Soon...

Make your way through Rebena Te Ra grabbing all the treasure chests.  
You will encounter ghost type enemies in this dungeon.  Simply cast Holy on
them to make them visible and then hit them with physical attacks. This will
make them MUCH easier to kill.

When you come to a glowing orb, you must hit it with a spell to deactivate it.
If the orb is Red you need to hit it with Fire.  If it is Blue, then hit it
with Blizzard.  If it is Purple, hit it with Thunder.  If it is white, then
any spell will work.  Once the orb is deactivated, hit it with your weapon
to destroy it.

When you come to a pattern on the ground that lights up when you stand on it,
you will need to allow a skeleton enemy to cast the correct spell on you to
activate the floor switch.  If the pattern is Red you need to get hit with a
Fire spell.  If it is Blue, then get hit by a Blizzard spell.  If it is
Purple, then you need to get hit with Thunder.  If it is white, then any
spell will work.

Make your way through the temple grounds to the next boss.

-- Boss Battle --
Name: Lich

Strategy:
        This boss can be impossible if you do not have the proper spells.  
First of all you will need the spell Holy.  If you do not have it, then give
up.  Next you will need Cure or some healing items.

At the start of the battle, take out the small skeleton goon.  Then head over
to the two orbs, one on the right and one on the left, and hit them with a
spell like Fire, Thunder, Blizzard, etc.  Once the barrier is removed from
both orbs, you will be able to attack the main boss.

Now use Holy on the boss to make him visible.  Once he is visible, get close
to him and start hacking away at him with your sword.  Eventually, the
barriers will go back up around the orbs.  He will be invulnerable during
this time.  Hit the orbs with spells again and take out any small goons and
then use Holy again on the boss.  Then use physical attacks.  Use healing
spells/items as needed.

Repeat this process until he is destroyed.

After you defeat the boss, you will get the option to read your new mail
and send something back to your family.  Send them something depending on what

[950] XIV. Secrets/Sidequests
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[951] -- Painting/Trimming Mog -----------------------------------------------

When you find a moogle house, you will notice that Mog is sitting on the 
carpet near the fireplace.  If you talk to him you will get a menu asking
if you want to paint Mog.  Choose "yes" to paint him.  

Now you can paint him red, green or blue.  You can also wash him and cut his
hair.  Use the D-Pad on your controller to spin him around and make him lay
down so you can paint/trim all of his body.

Painting Mog has the following effects:

1.  It changes the kind of radar your GameBoy Advance screen displays if you
    have one connected.

    Painting it the following colors has the following effects:

    None  - Terrain Radar 
    Red   - Monster Radar 
    Green - Scouter 
    Blue  - Treasure Radar 


2.  It changes the kind of spells your moogle will cast in battle.

    Painting it the following colors has the following effects:

    None  - Random spells
    Red   - Fire spells
    Green - Thunder spells
    Blue  - Blizzard spells


Trimming Mog's hair has the following effects:

Throughout the game there are dungeons that are either hot or cold.  Depending
on how long Mog's hair is in these dungeons, he will get tired slower or
faster.

If you cut his hair short in a hot dungeon, then he will not get tired as
fast.  However, if you let it grow long Mog will say "It's too hot!" and get
tired much faster.  This is annoying because you will have to carry the
chalice frequently.  So cut his hair short before going into a hot dungeon.

If you let his hair grow long in a cold dungeon, then he will not get tired as
fast.  However, if you cut it short Mog will say "It's freezing here!" and get
tired much faster.  This is annoying because you will have to carry the
chalice frequently.  So let his hair grow long before going into a cold
dungeon.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[952] -- Moogle Stamps -------------------------------------------------------

Collecting moogle stamps in the game allows you to unlock the mini-game
Blazin' Caravans.  The game will unlock once you collect all the stamps.

To begin collecting stamps you simply need to find a moogle house and talk to
a moogle.  The first time you speak to one it will initiate this sidequest.
The moogle will give you a stamp card as well as your first stamp.  Each time
you visit a different moogle in the world, you will get a new stamp.

Here is a diagram of the stamp card the moogle gives you:

house.  The moogle house entrance is a crack in that house.  To get there,
make your way to the far right from the entrance to Tida.  Follow the path
up and then left.  Cross over the small bridge and keep going until you hit

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[953] -- SECRET Item Locations -----------------------------------------------

Throughout the game in certain locations, you will find something I will refer
to as a SECRET item. The SECRET items in the game replenish themselves
everytime you complete a dungeon.  This gives you incentive to recheck each
spot to get a new SECRET item everytime.  Sometimes the SECRET item is of
little value like a seed or something.  However, occasionally you will get
something really good.

In this section I will reveal the locations of all the SECRET items in the
game.

-- Tipa --

Enter the town of Tipa and head all the way to the far left side of the town

search around until you see "Examine" popup on the screen.  Examine the area
to get the SECRET item.
