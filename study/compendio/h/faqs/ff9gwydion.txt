This guide to Final Fantasy IX marked my second contribution to the gaming
world back in 2002. One of these days I found myself looking back at what I
had created, and how much things had changed. Not just myself, but everything
in general. Basically, I was bored, so I started working on all my FAQs once
again, and tried to give them a proper final version. I recreated most of the
layout to make them more simple and intuitive but all the information is still
here, with some corrections and modifications.

This is a Secrets FAQ. This means that I will not be giving any explanations
on how to actually beat the game or on how to defeat any kind of monster, with
some honorable exceptions. I won't be giving any indications on how to work
with the menus and the controls or on how to work with the game. This is a
guide for people who have already finished the game once. If you're having
troubles, just seek out a different guide. Also, as you can imagine, spoilers
run free in this guide. If you're by any chance allergic to them, you should
probably get the hell out of here. Just giving you the heads up. You won't be
warned again.

On another topic. Please... do not email me. DO NOT EMAIL ME. I'm not giving
you any rules and procedures on how to contact me because, you simply
shouldn't. I'm not going to answer it so don't bother trying, there are lots
of people eager to please. I'm just not one of them.

Final Fantasy IX is a story of love and war, of sacrifice and hope and became
one of the greatest RPGs for the Playstation. This chapter sums up the events
of the ninth installment of the Final Fantasy Series.


 FINAL FANTASY IX
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Alexandria a festival is starting, a group of actors will be performing "I
want to be your canary" for several people including the royal family. They
arrive in a ship called Prima Vista but these "actors" are in fact a group of
thieves called the Tantalus and they pretend to kidnap Princess Garnet. Baku
leads the operation. Meanwhile, Zidane and Blank are in charge of the kidnap.
As Prima Vista flies over Alexandria a very strange kid arrives to see the
play, Vivi. But he's been tricked, his ticket is a fake. Fortunately he meets
another kid named Puck that helps him get inside the castle. As the play
starts Zidane and Blank manage to sneak inside the castle to proceed with the
plan. On their way to the royal quarters they encounter a stranger who seems
to be in a hurry. The stranger is in fact Princess Garnet, running away from
the castle. After a frenetic chase by Steiner, the Captain of the Knights of
Pluto and bodyguard of the princess they accidentally end up in stage. Zidane
and Garnet quickly start improvising and manage to continue with the play.
Meanwhile Vivi and Puck are being chased by the guards for entering without a
ticket. Vivi also ends up in the middle of the stage and while trying to stop
the guards with his fire magic he accidentally burns Garnet's clothes that
kept her disguised. Queen Brahne gets very mad and starts launching giant
harpoons to trap the ship and cannons to destroy it at all cost while Steiner
is fighting with Zidane, Vivi, Garnet and everyone else. The Prima Vista
manages to escape but suffers too much damage and eventually crashes in Evil
Forest from where no one was ever able to get out.

Zidane gets thrown out of the ship and Vivi, Steiner and Garnet are missing.
But once he sees them Garnet is kidnapped by a plant monster and Vivi is
trapped by another. After freeing Vivi they return to the ship and set up a
plan to save the princess. Baku refuses to put his crew in jeopardy so Zidane
goes on alone with Vivi and Steiner. When they reach Garnet she's being kept
by a huge plant monster and they engage in battle with it. Blank appears to
help and after defeating the plant they start being chased by minions of the
plant monsters. With the death of the Plant Monster, the whole forest starts
to turn into stone. The party manages to escape but Blank sacrificed himself
and turned into stone. The group now needs to go through the Ice Cave so they
can reach the top of the Mist. The Mist is very dangerous, it invades the
spirit and the mind. It's also breeding ground for various monsters and evil
creatures. While going through the Ice Cave they are struck by a powerful
blizzard that knocks the party out. Zidane manages to wake up and checks what
is causing the blizzard. He encounters a creature that calls himself Black
Waltz Nr. 1. After defeating him the party proceeds to the village of Dali.
Before reaching the village, Garnet adopts an alias, everyone will be calling
her Dagger from now on so people don't find out that she's actually the heir
to the throne of Alexandria.

When they arrive to Dali, people start acting strange and after a while Vivi
is kidnapped. Zidane and Dagger quickly try to save him and find a secret
factory underneath the village. Meanwhile Steiner goes to the Observatory
Mountain trying to find out when the next ship arrives. Zidane and the rest of
the gang keep exploring the factory and see various machines processing Mist,
making strange eggs that turn out to be, Black Mages just like Vivi! These
Black Mages seem dolls and they were being shipped to Alexandria Castle.
Finally a ship arrives but the party is suddenly stunned by the arrival of a
Black Mage, Black Waltz Nr.2. After defeating him everyone boards the ship.
They quickly realize that the cargo ship is controlled by Black Mages! They
act like zombies and can't seem to speak. Zidane immediately manages to get a
hold of the ship and changes course to Lindblum. The Black Waltz Nr. 3 appears
and tries to kill Vivi but suddenly all the Black Mages protect him and
because of that the Black Waltz kills them all. Devastated by such atrocious
act, Vivi defeats the Black Waltz. One thing is clear, Queen Brahne ordered
the 3 mages to search for Garnet. They reach Lindblum and quickly ask to see
Regent Cid. Shockingly, Regent Cid is an Oglop! He was turned into an Oglop by
his wife for his womanizing before leaving with his Hilda Garde 1 airship that
was able to fly without Mist. Eventually Cid reveals that he was the one who
ordered Tantalus to kidnap the princess. Seems that he was worried about the
Queen's recent behavior and keeping a promise to Garne's father he decided to
try to save her  while maintaining a low-profile. After a while the party
encounters Baku and his crew. They managed to escape the Evil Forest unharmed.
After that Zidane goes into town and meets an old friend, Freya who is in
Lindblum for the Hunting Contest. After the festival is over, during the
awarding ceremony a message comes from Burmecia, they were being attacked by a
powerful army of Black Mages. Maintaining an ancient alliance Cid quickly
sends the airships protecting the border with Alexandria but Freya still wants
to go by herself. Zidane also wants to go and Vivi as well but they have to
wait before the gates are opened. They have a lunch in the mean time but the
food has a sleeping weed in it and everyone faints. Dagger was the one to
blame. She wants to return to Alexandria and challenge her mother. Steiner
gladly escorts the princess back home.

When the rest of the gang wakes up they move on to Burmecia and on the way
they meet a new pal. Quina joins the party at Qu's Marsh, ordered by her
master to see the world and meet new people. In Burmecia the kingdom is
practically destroyed. Brahne, Beatrix, the greatest knight of Alexandria and
a mysterious man named Kuja are in a meeting. The party hears the discussion.
They are planning to attack Creyra next, a village built in a giant tree and
protected by a powerful sandstorm. Zidane and his friends try to stop them but
Beatrix quickly defeats them. Meanwhile Dagger and Steiner reach the Summit
Station where they find two of the Tantalus members, Cinna and Marcus. Cinna
was returning to Lindblum while Marcus was trying to find the Supersoft that
could bring their friend Blank back to life. Dagger quickly offers to help in
gratitude for Blank's sacrifice and so they head for Treno on board of a
train. In the middle of the trip the Black Waltz Nr. 3 appears once again only
to be finally defeated. Dagger, Marcus and Steiner finally reach Treno and in
the middle of the night they enter a store to steal the Supersoft only to be
found by Doctor Tot, Dagger's childhood tutor. Tot says he will give them the
item later and after a while they meet him again in his tower where they
finally get a hands on the Supersoft. Marcus needs to get to Evil Forest.
Meanwhile, Dagger and Steiner still need to get to Alexandria. For that Tot
tells them about a tunnel that connects Treno and Alexandria. They travel
through the tunnel riding a Gargant. When they arrive at Alexandria's Castle
through Gargant Roo, Zorn and Torn trap them. Steiner says he returned with
the princess but the two jesters reply he was considered a traitor by
Queen Brahne.

Meanwhile Zidane and the rest of the party reach Creyra right on time to save
Puck from being killed by an Antlion. Afterwards a ritual starts to make the
sandstorm stronger. The strings of the sacred harp that was being used for the
ritual break and the villagers consider this a terrible omen. The sandstorm
eventually stops and the King of Burmecia, that fled to Creyra begins to
consider the possibility of an invasion by Brahne's forces. In Alexandria,
Dagger talks to her mother but Kuja puts her into a deep sleep so that they
can extract from her the Eidolons, powerful summons. Zorn and Torn manage to
extract them from Dagger and Brahne intends to use this new power. Meanwhile
Brahne's forces begin their attack on Creyra and the villagers take shelter in
the chapel. Beatrix manages to steal the stone that powered the harp of the
sandstorm ritual and escapes through a teleporting system. The party uses this
same system to reach Brahne's Red Rose, the flagship. Using the extracted
Eidolons Brahne summons Odin. Odin throws his sword and completely destroys
Creyra, just like Kuja said it would. Brahne is delighted by the Eidolon's
terrific powers but Beatrix is frustrated since she believed her forces would
be more that enough to attack Creyra and Burmecia. She meets the Queen and
delivers her the jewel she stole, only one jewel remains. Brahne shows no
appreciation for her work and Beatrix gets sad as the queen just keeps giving
more and more orders. Brahne orders the execution of Garnet for escaping with
the royal pendant leaving Beatrix in shock. Knowing this, the party teleports
to Alexandria to save Garnet. They meet up with Steiner and Marcus. Marcus
goes to the Evil Forest to save Blank and the rest of the party will go to the
secret dungeon to try and save Dagger. After finding the princess they quickly
dispose of Zorn and Thorn but soon Beatrix shows up to stop them and she
easily defeats the party. Once she sees the princess in a deep sleep Beatrix
uses her powers to awake Dagger. Brahne arrives at last and orders the
execution of everyone. Freya and Beatrix stay behind as the rest of the party
escapes but Steiner feels he has to return and goes in help of the two
knights. Meanwhile Zidane and the rest of the gang get caught once again by
Zorn and Torn only to be freed by Marcus and Blank, finally restored of his
petrification.

Once again they ride the Gargant to Treno but a Ralvuimahgo chases them and
they end up in Pinnacle Rocks near Lindblum. In here Garnet finds Ramuh, god
of the thunder who accepts being her Eidolon. Meanwhile Zorn and Torn aren't
allowed to get near the Queen as punishment for letting Dagger escape with the
jewel. Brahne brings out 2 hunters Lani and a mysterious red-haired man and
offers them a reward for the pendant that Dagger has with her, giving them
full permission to do whatever it takes to retrieve it and she also requests
them to murder Vivi. Not only that but Brahne is also interested in Zidane and
offers an extra reward to whoever kills him. The red-haired man seems
particularly glad about it. As they leave a soldier informs Brahne they are
ready to leave. While leaving Pinnacle Rocks the party sees Brahne invading
Lindblum with the Black Mages and summoning Atomos, leaving the town in ruins
and destroying the whole Industrial District. They rush to the city to talk to
Cid. The regent puts the party up to date on how Kuja's the responsible for
Brahne's weapons and that he's probably from the Outer Continent. Brahne
demanded the control of Lindblum's new airship and of the Falcon Claw as terms
for Lindblum's surrender. Confident that they really need to stop Kuja and end
Brahne's weapons supply they rush to Fossil Roo that apparently is a
connection to the outer continent. They reach the underground passage only to
be stopped by Lani who wants the pendant back. She is eventually defeated and
the party is allowed to proceed to the Outer Continent. As they reach the new
continent they notice there's no Mist there. The party proceeds to Conde
Petie, a small village where they find a Black Mage, a talking Black Mage.
They end up chasing him and discover his hidden village.

As the party enters the Black Mage Village Vivi goes hysterical and tries to
find anyone to talk with. The villagers seem very frightened and by talking to
some of them Zidane and the rest of the party discover they were tools of war
that gained a conscience on the battlefield. Terrified, they ran and ended up
hiding in this village. Vivi is sad about how the Black Mages were treated and
about the secret he found out. Black Mages have a short lifespan, and
eventually come to a stop. At the inn, later on Zidane starts telling a story
to Dagger about a man who didn't know where he came from. One day he left the
home of his adoptive father in search for his birthplace but never found it.
He returned to his adoptive father and he smacked him up for running away but
the son was happy and he knew that was his real home (the only reason for
referring the story is that it's pretty obvious that the man is actually
Zidane and the adoptive father is Baku). Zidane meets up with Vivi. He's
talking to a Black Mage about stopping and death. In the morning they decide
to return to Conde Petie and reach a place called the Sanctuary, to where some
Black Mages saw Kuja heading.

They try to reach the Sanctuary but only those who pass the marriage ceremony
are allowed to travel to the Sanctuary. And so, Zidane "marries" Dagger and
Vivi "marries" Quina. On their way they bump into a thief, a little girl named
Eiko. In battle the party finds out that the girl also has the power to summon
eidolons. Zidane and his friends follow her to her home, Madain Sari. They
arrive and see a village in shambles. Eiko decided to prepare a great dinner
while Zidane and Dagger visit the Eidolon Wall. During the meal Eiko reveals
more about the Iifa Tree (the Sanctuary) and how it is protected by a seal.
Apparently the ancient summoners that lived in Madain Sari tried to summon a
Eidolon near the Iifa Tree but failed, as a result they sealed the location
fearing another tragedy, like the one that haunted their past. After a lot of
discussion the party reaches the Tree and notice all the Mist and how the Iifa
Tree seems to be the source of all the Mist. Eiko removes the seal and they
manage to reach the core of the Tree where the creature responsible for
creating the Mist rests. After defeating it the Mist stops and the party
returns to Madain Sari. As they enter a Moogle warns that something precious
was stolen.

The sacred jewel of Madain Sari was stolen. In the Eidolon Wall Eiko is held
hostage by Lani. She stole the jewel and wants Dagger's jewel as well, her
pendant, in exchange for Eiko's life. Meanwhile the red-haired man arrives and
tells Lani to take a hike. After that, he challenges Zidane to a fight and
looses, leaving in shame. That afternoon Dagger has a vision on how she was
actually from Madain Sari and she saw its destruction by a giant eye in the
sky. The next day they decide to return to the Iifa tree and wait there for
Kuja. After his defeat, the red-haired man decides to join the party, his real
name is Amarant. They reach the top of the tree just as Kuja arrives, but
Brahne is also there, together with her naval fleet and she wants to take Kuja
down as he's the only one powerful enough to mach her forces. The only thing
Brahne wants is total domination and she starts firing at Kuja while he
summons monsters to attack Brahne's forces. Meanwhile Dagger tries to help her
mother and runs to the place where the summoners failed to retrieve an Eidolon
in hope she can gain its power. In fact she does manage to retrieve it but
this Eidolon attacks with a powerful tsunami which would kill her mother
instead of helping her.

Tired of the fight Brahne summons Bahamut, the Dragon King. Kuja seems to have
been expecting that moment and brings forth the giant eye in the sky, killing
the Black Mages, corrupting Bahamut and turning the Eidolon against its
summoner, Brahne. After the battle is over, the party finds the queen ashore
near her escape pod with several injuries. She eventually dies but in her last
moments she comforts Garnet and shows her regrets. Using the queen's escape
pod the party returns to Alexandria with the four jewels. Garnet is now Queen
of Alexandria and the party decides to attend the Card Tournament in Treno
since the kingdom is now at peace. Garnet and Eiko trade jewels and each one
will keep two of them. After the tournament they talk with Cid who was in town
to participate in the tournament but also to test the new Hilda Garde 2, but
Eiko is very afraid, something is happening in Alexandria. Bahamut, the Dragon
King, controlled by Kuja, is attacking Alexandria. Garnet watches powerless to
stop him. She eventually reaches a part of the castle she had never seen
before. In the sky appears the Hilda Garde 2 and Eiko's two Jewels begin to
sparkle, she jumps only to be saved by the power of the Jewels. Together with
Garnet they both pray for the Holy Judgment. The castle transforms and
Alexander appears, the most powerful Eidolon. The holy summon quickly disables
Bahamut. Kuja is amazed and tries to control it just like he did with Bahamut.
But someone seems to be there to ruin his plans, an old man named Garland and
he uses the power of the Invincible, the great eye in the sky, to destroy
Alexander. The party awakes in Lindblum after being rescued. Garnet is sad
because of her mother and the kingdom, she doesn't seem to be able to talk.
Cid tells Zidane and the rest of the gang about his discovery on how Kuja has
a hold of the Hilda Garde 1 and he's using it to travel. Meanwhile, a new
attempt to turn Cid into human once again ends in failure.

Now traveling by boat the party decides to visit the Black Mage Village again
to know more about Kuja and the location of his headquarters. Thanks to the
information given by the Black Mages they manage to enter Kuja's palace only
to walk in a trap. Kuja makes a proposition to Zidane, he chooses a party to
go on a quest or he kills all of them. Zidane accepts and the four selected
members are dropped in Oeilvert, an ancient place surrounded by an anti-magic
field. In here Zidane and the rest of the gang find out a lot from that eye in
the sky, the Invincible. The Invincible is in fact a ship. They also know more
about a strange planet called Terra and on how it declined to a certain doom
with no chance of stopping it. The party retrieves the Gulug Stone and returns
to the palace. Meanwhile the others left behind find a way to escape and they
meet up with Zidane and try to put a stop to Kuja but Eiko is captured by Zorn
and Torn and they all manage to escape in the Hilda Garde 1, only to be
followed by the rest of the party aboard the Blue Narciss. They follow Kuja to
Esto Gaza in the Lost Continent and proceed to Mount Gulug where Kuja is
hiding. They can see Eiko and Zorn and Torn are trying to retrieve her
Eidolons as they did to Dagger. They fail because Eiko isn't 16 years old, the
minimum age needed for the Eidolons to be extracted, but Kuja insists he needs
a more powerful Eidolon so he can beat Garland. The extraction continues but
Mog protects Eiko and goes into Trance revealing his true form, an Eidolon
named Madeen. Kuja is amazed by the power a subject gains as he enters in
Trance. After Kuja escapes, the party finds Hilda, Cid's wife who was being
held by Kuja.

Back in Lindblum Hilda transforms Cid back into human and prepares a
conference to brief everyone about Kuja's plans. Kuja told Hilda that he was
not from this world. Kuja is from a planet known as Terra and he called the
planet they're in, Gaia and he's using it to achieve an even greater power. He
also referred a passage to this new world located in the Shimmering Islands
but a seal seems to prevent anyone from entering. They prepare to leave to
Ipsen's castle to break the seal until they find Dagger is missing. They
search everywhere and Zidane finally locates her in Alexandria, Dagger can
talk again and uses a knife to cut her hair. Finally the party goes on to
Ipsen's Castle and successfully retrieve the Four Keys to break the seal. The
party realizes all the keys must be inserted at once and so they split up,
Steiner and Vivi, Amarant and Freya, Eiko and Dagger and Zidane and Quina.
They manage to break the seal and through the Shimmering Islands they reach
Terra. Once they arrive Garland is already waiting for them but he disappears.
Zidane and everyone else reach Bran Bal and they see the Invincible. Dagger
faints, but an astonishing revelation is made. That planet is filled with
clones of Zidane. They call themselves the Genomes. Apparently these Genomes
are empty, with no emotions but Zidane had a special purpose when he was
created and that's why he is different.

Wanting to know more Zidane meets Garland at Pandemonium. Garland reveals his
plan to turn Gaia into Terra and how Zidane is a very special Genome as is
Kuja. Kuja was mean to be nothing more than a temporary soldier to fill in the
place that should be occupied by Zidane when he grew up. Kuja didn't accept
his fate and dumped Zidane on Gaia hoping he would die before claming his
rightful place. Zidane doesn't accept Garland's ideals and swears to take him
down at all cost, but the old man puts Zidane in a deep sleep. When Zidane
awakes he starts thinking about all the things he discovered. The rest of the
party help him see the right path and they head to fight Garland. After
defeating the old man, Kuja appears controlling the Invincible. Using the
ship's powers to manage souls Kuja uses the souls that the ship has to make
him reach a Trance. Insane and more powerful than ever Kuja unleashes Ultima,
sending the planet to a spiral of destruction that will eventually consume the
whole planet. Using the Invincible the party escapes with all the Genomes on
board. When returning to Gaia they notice that the whole planet is covered in
Mist. After leaving the Genomes in the Black Mage Village the party rushes to
the Iifa Tree where they enter Memoria.

Memoria is a place where the memories of everyone since the beginning built a
parallel world. Through Memoria they revive moments since the dawn of time and
finally reach the end of their adventure, they have to save the powerful
Crystal that sustains the balance of the world from being destroyed by Kuja.
In a frenetic battle the fallen angel of Garland's plan is defeated but his
Ultima Attack puts the party on the limit of their strength. The crystal has
been broken. A strange voice talks to Zidane and his companions. The voice
threatens to use the Crystal to remove the things that exist and create a new
world from scratch. Zidane and the party oppose and gain enough strength to
win the ultimate battle. As Necron dies, the world of nothing from which he
came starts to collapse around him. Before the explosion killed the eight
daring adventurers, Kuja uses his last shred of power to teleport the party
to safety. Outside Memoria, Cid, aboard the Hilda Garde 3 and Beatrix aboard
the Red Rose patiently waited for their friends. They all board the Hilda
Garde but Zidane goes back to save Kuja. He locates him but is suddenly struck
by the Iifa Tree and dies. Some time later, life returns to the normal course
and The Tantalus return to Alexandria to perform "I want to be your canary".
Dagger still misses Zidane but she believes she has to go on with her life,
like Zidane would want her to. Quina is now a consecrated chef, Amarant
continues with Lani, Steiner finally shows his love for Beatrix, Freya is now
with her long-lost love Sir Fratley and they plan to reconstruct Lindblum,
Vivi supposedly married and has many sons who came to watch the play and Eiko
is with Cid and Hilda and she treats Cid as Father, both Cid and Hilda seem to
like the idea. And the grand finale, in the middle of the play Zidane reveals
himself and runs to Dagger. After the Iifa Tree struck him, he was injured but
alive. The final moments are a reunion between two souls of the same kind.
Zidane and Garnet. They lived happily ever after.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Baku, Blank, Cinna, Marcus, Ruby, and the Nero Brothers are, together with
Zidane, members of Tantalus. They pretend to be actors and perform shows in

perhaps the only one in the group that actually cares more about the acting
than the other less-than-honorable dealings the group has.

Queen is almost blinding. Later, she repents for her actions by helping

Garnet's past. He is not originally from Gaia. To travel between Gaia and his
planet, Terra, he uses the Invincible, a marvelous ship.


 BLACK MAGES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Man-made weapons. They are, quite literally, dolls used for war. But some of
them started to gain consciousness and a will of their own and eventually ran
away, hiding in a village on another continent. They quickly realized their
lifespan is quite short and because of that they help Kuja in his quest when
he promises them to solve the problem.


 SIR FRATLEY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He is Freya's long-lost love. He went out on a journey to improve his combat

the people of Gaia and Terra.

Thanks to ffonline.com for providing me with information on the formulas used
to calculate the damage made by some of the techniques.
»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»

Most abilities cause certain damage depending on the character's strength and
the enemy's defense. But there are skills that have a different way of working
or that have a special formula to calculate the damage made.


 ZIDANE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flee                   You will drop an amount of Gil equal to 10% of the
                       total Gil you would've won from the battle.
Lucky Seven            When the last digit in Zidane's current HP is 7,
                       Zidane will inflict at random either 7, 77, 777, or
                       7777 damage on a single target.
Thievery               Damage is equal to the number of times Zidane has
                       successfully stolen multiplied by half Zidane's Speed.


 VIVI
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comet                  Power is equal to 56 multiplied by a random number
                       between 1 and (Vivi's current level + Vivi's Magic).
Meteor                 Power is equal to 88 multiplied by a random number
                       between 1 and (Vivi's current level + Vivi's Magic).
                       The chance of Success is equal to (Vivi's current
                       level divided by 2) + Vivi's Spirit


 STEINER
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Darkside               Steiner expends 12.5% of his total HP to deliver an
                       attack that is 40% stronger than normal and ignores
                       the target's Protect status.
Minus Strike           Steiner inflicts damage on a single enemy equal to the
                       amount of HP he has lost.
Thunder Slash          Damages the target equal to 19% of its Max HP with a
                       lightning-elemental attack.


 GARNET
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Life                   Character recovers (5 + target's Spirit)% of their
                       Max HP.


 AMARANT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chakra                 Character recovers 20% of the Max HP and MP.
Spare Change           Uses an amount of Gil equal to Amarant's current level
                       multiplied by 101. Damage is equal to (Amount of Gil
                       used [squared] multiplied by Amarant's Spirit) divided
                       by (amount of Gil owned multiplied by 10).
Revive                 Amarant recovers a KO'd party member and restores an
                       amount of HP equal to (20 + Target's Spirit)% of their
                       Max HP.
Demi Shock             Damages an enemy equal to 20% of their Max HP.


 FREYA
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lancer                 Causes physical damage to an enemy that is 20% stronger
                       sthan a regular attack. MP is also reduced by 1/16 of
                       the amount of damage inflicted.
Six Dragons            Six dragons appear to perform one of three possible
                       results to each character individually in the party:
                       30% chance HP and MP is fully restored, 35% chance
                       that nothing will happen and 35% chance HP and MP is
                       reduced to 1.
White Draw             Restores MP for the whole party by an amount equal to
                       anywhere between 0 and 1 less than double the enemy's
                       level you selected.
Dragon Breath          Damages all enemies by an amount equal to how much HP
                       the targeted monster has lost.
Dragon's Crest         Delivers an amount of damage to a single enemy equal
                       to the square of the number of Dragon type monsters
                       the party has slain.


 QUINA
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aqua Breath            Inflicts an amount of water-elemental damage to all
                       enemies equal to 1/4 their Max HP.
Twister                Inflicts random damage to all enemies based on 55
                       multiplied by a random number between 1 and (Quina's
                       current level + Quina's Magic).

  005. THE HIDDEN POWER                                              ID#02.005

Thanks to ffonline.com for providing me with information on the formulas used
to calculate the damage made by the Eidolons.
»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»

When summoned, Eidolons perform attacks or healing effects either in the party
or in the target enemies but they all have secrets behind these attacks that
will determine the damage the Eidolon makes even when they are summoned in
Trance. If summoned in Trance the number of stones in stock will not
determinate the attack power.


 EIDOLON           ATTACK POWER
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Shiva             36 + Nr. of Opals in stock           (34 when in Trance)
 Ifrit             42 + Nr. of Topaz in stock           (37 when in Trance)
 Ramuh             32 + Nr. of Peridot in stock         (31 when in Trance)
 Leviathan         59 + Nr. of Aquamarine in stock      (63 when in Trance)
 Bahamut           88 + Nr. of Garnet in stock          (77 when in Trance)
 Ark               106 + Nr. of Lapis Lazuli in stock   (87 when in Trance)
 Madeen            71 + Eiko's current level
   

But there are other attacks that can be a bit tricky to calculate or that
change if some conditions are met.


 ATOMOS' G-FORCE 199
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Atomos unleashes G-Force 199. This attack's damage is based on the % of the
enemy's Max HP (30 + Nr. of Amethyst in stock). For instance, by having 70
Amethyst stones in your inventory, you can cut off 100% of the enemy's HP
(although the damage is capped at 9999). When in Trance the damage is always
16% of the Max HP.


 ODIN'S ZANTETSUKEN
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Odin's attack is great because it can instantly kill and enemy. The odds of
that happening depend on the number of Ores in your inventory (Nr. of Ores in
stock ÷ 2). Since you can carry a max of 99 Ores, the best you can get is
49,5% of Odin killing the enemy. Although, if you have Odin's Sword equipped
and if the enemy survives the attack, the number of Ores will work against you
(142 - Nr. of Ores in stock), so if you have 99 Ores in your inventory, Odin's
attack power will be 43. When in Trance, Odin's attack will have an attack
power of 42.


 CARBUNCLE'S LIGHT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Carbuncle's attack will change depending on the stone Eiko has equipped. The
normal version will cast Reflect on the party. If Eiko has a Diamond equipped,
Carbuncle will cast vanish. With an Emerald, Carbuncle will cast Haste and if
Eiko has a Moonstone equipped, it will be Shell. An extra spell can be cast
depending on the animation version. The long version will also cast Protect on
the party, regardless of the jewel equipped.


 FENRIR'S MILLENNIAL DECAY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fenrir has two attacks. The normal is an earth-based Terrestial Rage but if
the Maiden Prayer is equipped, Fenrir will perform a wind-elemental attack
named, Millennial Decay. The attack power for both attacks is also different.
The Terrestial Rage is a weaker attack (42 + Nr. of Sapphires in stock) than
the Millennial Decay (44 + Nr. of Sapphires in stock) but both depend on the
number of Sapphires in stock.


 PHOENIX'S REBIRTH FLAME
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phoenix's rebirth flame causes damage to the enemy while restoring your party
members to a % of their Max HP (30 + Spirit stat). Both the damage and the HP
recovered increase with the full animation. But Phoenix may also cast Rebirth
Flame after all party members are KO'd, in essence giving you a continue
instead of a game over (Phoenix Pinions in stock ÷ 256). Since the max number
of Phoenix Pinions you can have is 99, the change of Phoenix using Rebirth
Flame automatically is 0.38, multiplied by 100 you get 38%.

 03. THE QUEST
«««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««
  001. THE EXCALIBUR                                                 ID#03.001
»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»

There are two versions of the Excalibur on Final Fantasy IX. One of them will
require money, and the other will require time. The quest for the Excalibur II
is perhaps the most annoying and difficult in the game.


» EXCALIBUR «
The mythical Excalibur makes an appearance on Final Fantasy once again. But
this little baby needs certain items that you can get by making offers at
Treno's Auction House and selling them to people certain people before you can
actually get it. (More information here: ID#03.009)


  ITEMS                  BUYERS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Rat Tail               Mage near the Card Carta Club
  Doga's Artifact        Man at the Synthesis Shop
  Griffin's Heart        Mage near the Card Carta Club
  Une's Mirror           Rich Man walking around the Card Carta Club


When you buy and sell these 4 items, a rare object will appear at the Auction
that's very expensive, the Magical Fingertip. Be sure that you have a good
amount of money before bidding. Bring the item to Daguerreo and give it to the
old man near the Inn. In return he will give you the Excalibur. You can buy
and sell these items for as long as you like and don't worry, the Magical
Fingertip can sometimes take a while to appear, just proceed with the game and
it will eventually show up.


» EXCALIBUR II «
Getting the Excalibur is easy, but I can't say the same about the Excalibur
II. To get it you will need no reach Memoria and defeat Lich in less than 12
hours. It's a race against time to get the most powerful sword in the game and
every help on how to cut time is useful.

Skip all ATEs and FMVs (open and close the disc cover to skip the FMVs). Don't
save a lot and ride as much as you can with Choco to prevent battles (be
careful because this will make your characters weak and impossible to defeat a
boss). Put all the game speed at max and pray to heavens so you can get there
on time. The Excalibur II is right on the screen where you fight Lich.
Usually, there's a Save point on the left side of the room but if you're under
12 hours the (?) will become an (!). Examine it and you'll get the Excalibur
II with a note from Gil's brother.

"To Brother Gil. Bro, I found the sword like you told me. But there were two
of them. One of 'em had a lame name, somethin' II. It was a dingy, old thing
with flashy decorations, something you'd probably like. So I went with
Excalipur. I'll be back after I find the Tin Armor."

The Excalipur appeared on Final Fantasy V and Gilgamesh actually uses this
sword. But once you get a hold of it it's very lame. With the Excalibur II in
your possession it's time to go in search for all the things you left behind
and start leveling up. There has been a rumor saying that if you wait until
the clock reaches 99:99:99 he will reset back to 00:00:00 and you can get the
Excalibur II then. It's true that the clock resets back to 00:00:00 and turns
red but the Excalibur II will not appear. If you want it just reach Memoria in
12 hours or less, there's no other way.

  002. THE STELLAZZIOS                                               ID#03.002
»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»

All around Gaia you can find some coins, these coins are of no importance to
you, but in Treno, Queen Stella collects them and she's willing to give you a
reward for every coin you deliver. The more coins you give her, the better the
prizes will be.


 ARIES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Location:   The Windmill in Dali.
Story:      "The story of 12 Zodiacs. The 11 Zodiacs pondered. How best to
            catch Virgo's Heart? Aries headed east."


 TAURUS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Location:   It's behind the item shop in Treno (Slums).
Story:      "Taurus had an idea. He would give Virgo a gift. Through the
            forest and over the mountain, he found a star."


 GEMINI
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Location:   By the fountain when you enter Treno, drop 10 Gil 11 times.
Story:      "Gemini thought by the river: 'I will sing her a song'. He didn't
            know where she was, but he hoped his song would reach her."


 CANCER
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Location:   In Burmecia, behind a cart filled with apples by the entrance.
Story:      "Cancer headed to the cape where Virgo waited. The sun was
            setting into the ocean. Will he finally see her?"


 LEO
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Location:   In the room with the Neptune Statue in Alexandria Castle.
Story:      "Leo was waiting for the sun to set into the ocean. Then Cancer
            showed up, and they began to fight. Into the ocean they fell."


 VIRGO
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Location:   In the Black Mage Village's Inn.
Story:      "Watching the sunset from the cape, Virgo whispered, 'My only wish
            is to be with you now...'"


 LIBRA
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Location:   Behind the fountain in Madain Sari.
Story:      "Libra was a perverse fellow. He would always walk in the opposite
            direction of the sun. Would he ever see Virgo?"


 SCORPIO
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Location:   Down the ladder in Quan's Dwelling.
Story:      "Scorpio was very timid. He always looked at his shadow, until one
            day, he decided to look away. He walked up a hill."


 SAGITTARIUS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Location:   In Lindblum, to the left of the woman selling pickles.
Story:      "Sagittarius dashed through the night, defying the chilly northern
            wind that was touching his right cheek."


 CAPRICORN
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Location:   Search the water by the entrance of Daguerreo.
Story:      "Impatient Capricorn ran up a hill toward the sun and fell asleep
            from exhaustion."


 AQUARIUS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Location:   On the first screen of Ipsen's Castle.
Story:      "Aquarius arrived late. He asked everyone, 'Who kissed Virgo?'"


 PISCES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Location:   Inside the Invincible.
Story:      "Pisces said to Aquarius, "Virgo made her choice. Go see him and
            he'll tell you the rest."


 OPIUCHUS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Location:   Where you found the coin of the one who kissed Virgo.
Story       "Their future was uncertain, but Scorpio and Virgo kissed in the
            light of dusk that moment meant everything."  =Opiuchus=


The story in the coins actually points to the location of the Opiuchus. It's
clearly to the East, in a hill, probably surrounded by mountains and forests,
near the ocean. Leo and Cancer fell in the sea so there's probably something
in the water near that location. It's somewhere between night and day.
Eventually, all clues lead to Quan's Dwelling, where you found Scorpio. It's
in a hill, near the sea (where you can find a treasure with Choco) surrounded
by forests, with a beautiful sunset between the night (Treno) and day
(Alexandria). Go to the location where you found Scorpio and you will get the
Opiuchus. After that, go meet Queen Stella to collect the rewards.

Thanks to Amy Dubs for informing me of some Mistakes in the letter sequence
and Tom Margett for the location of Mochos.

Since Moogles help you along the way it would be nice if you could help them.
It seems that Mognet Central, which is responsible for delivering the mail, is
not doing a good job, so it's your job to help them out. Something is wrong
with the machine that processes the mail and a very special item is needed.
Below is a list of the letters you can deliver, remember you need to deliver
at least 50% of the letters to be able to fix Mognet Central.


  FROM        LOCATION               TO         LOCATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Kupo        Alexandria Chapel      Monty      Evil Forest
  Mois        Ice Cavern             Gumo       Dali

  Kumool      Ipsen's Castle         Mois       Fossil Roo Entrance
  Mois        Fossil Roo Entrance    Noggy      Daguerreo
  Noggy       Daguerreo              Kupo       Alexandria Chapel


These letters are listed in the order as you get them. That means that if you
skip a letter you probably missed a moogle. That doesn't mean they have to be
delivered in this particular order but be careful of certain moogles and
locations because they might become inaccessible to you at certain points of
the game. As far as I know, this list is complete, so there are only 28
letters you can deliver. The final sequence starts after your visit to Terra.
For that, head to Alexandria and talk to Kupo. Kupo will have a letter to
Atla, Atla will have one to Mogryo, Mogryo needs you to deliver one to Kumool,
Kumool has one for Mois, Mois to Noggy and Noggy will ask you deliver the last
letter to Kupo.

When Kupo receives the final letter from Noggy he will tell you the item that
Mognet Central needs is the Superslick and that someone in Alexandria has it.
Go talk to Ruby (she's at the theatre near the chapel) and she will give you
the item the moogles need. Now you need to rush to Mognet Central. To the
North of Madain Sari is a relatively big island with a forest and some
mountains, if you look closely there is a crack on one of the sides of the
mountain, it's the entrance to Mognet Central, get yourself a Gold Chocobo and
use a Dead Pepper to break your way through. Inside, give the Superslick to
Artemicion, head of Mognet. You will receive a gift for all your trouble, a
Protect Ring! If youre curious on how many letters you delivered one of the
Moogles will give you that info. Once again, remember that you need to deliver
at least 50% of the letters in order to access the final sequence. That means
you need to deliver at least 11 letters of the first part of the letters
sequence.

  005. RAGTIME'S QUIZ SHOW                                           ID#03.005

During your adventure you will encounter special battles. One of such special
battles are the ones in which you battle the Ragtime Mouse, he will make you
a total of 16 questions, one for each time you face him. He's hard to
encounter but you can find him in any forest of the world. Personally, I just
moved randomly through the forest outside the Black Mage Village. When you
enter in a battle with the Ragtime Mouse do not attack him and be sure you
actually read the sentence. There are two signs behind the Ragtime. Attack the
one that answers your question, yes or no. For each battle you'll get a good
amount of EXP and Gil. After answering all of the questions just meet him one
more time and he will be defeated. After that you'll be awarded with a Protect
Ring.

  006. THE SPIRITS OF GAIA                                           ID#03.006

Besides the Ragtime Mouse's quiz show there are special battles called Spirits
of Gaia. In specific locations you will find monsters that will make you a
request, if you give them the item they want you'll get a reward. Remember,
don't attack the spirits or they'll go away. Also, you don't need to meet them
in any particular order, except the Yan, although there is a certain logic to
it, since most spirits will reward you with the items you need to comply with
the request of the next spirit. To be able to meet the Yan you are required to
have met all the other spirits. Also, helping the spirits will make you gain
lots of AP, so before trying to find any of them activate the Ability Up and
prepare to learn some techniques.

Completing this particular sidequest brings other benefits. By answering the
request of the spirits of Gaia, Ozma will be a lot easier to defeat. On
another topic, be careful of the Gimme Cat. He can usually be found right
outside of Daguerreo or on the surrounding islands. He will ask you for a
Diamond. Don't give him anything. If you do he will simply leave without
giving you any reward of any kind. Don't attack him either, he has powerful
attacks and even if you beat him, the rewards aren't that great.

  007. MORRID'S COFFEE                                               ID#03.007
»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»

In Dali's Observatory lives an old man named Morrid. He searches for three
very special coffee beans - Burman, Moccha and Kirman Coffee. If you give him
the three coffees he will in return award you with his Mini-Prima Vista.


  COFFEE BEAN          LOCATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Burman Coffee        Dali's Windmill
  Kirman Coffee        Eiko's Kitchen in Madain Sari
  Moccha Coffee        In South Gate, by the fountain


The Mocha Coffee can be found in South Gate, by the fountain where Cinna made
some coffee for Baku and the rest of the Tantalus after they left Evil Forest
(as seen in the ATE "Baku and his crew"). The Kirman Coffee is pretty
straightforward. The Burman Coffee is the harder to get because you need to
get the Mayor's key in order to go through the locked door. To do that, return
to the Mayor's house when he's not there, during the Card Tournament in Treno.
You will be given the chance to explore the room. This is sort of a mini-game,
you have to explore the room without waking up the Mayor's son. Choose to
explore any part of the house. Now, you will be given the option to explore
more. Choose to explore the same place until the Mayor's son goes back to a
deep sleep (if you search another place right away the Mayor's son will
awake). Do this until you find the Mayor's Key. Enter the windmill and look
below the plate full of Chocobo food. You will find some Gil and the Burman
Coffee.

This sidequest has to be done before DISC 4. Otherwise the Observatory will be
locked by roots along with the South Gate and Morrid will be dead because of
the earthquake that occurred when the roots of the Iifa Tree extended. Don't
forget to do it before you reach Terra.

  008. THE ACTION FIGURES                                            ID#03.008
»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»

You can collect these small action figures all around the world. They seem to
do nothing besides taking up space in your key items inventory, but they'll be
a great help when you try to get the S Rank.


  FIGURINE           LOCATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Mini-Cid           Treno's Auction house
  Mini-Burmecia      The Tantalus' hideout in Lindblum
  Mini-Brahne        The Mayor's House in Dali
  Mini-Prima Vista   The Tantalus' hideout in Lindblum


Getting the Mini-Cid is easy. Just bid for it at Treno's Auction House. The
Mini-Burmecia can be found in the Tantalus' hideout in Lindblum. For the
Mini-Brahne, when searching for the Mayor's key at his house you can also find
the Mini-Brahne on the desk. As for the Mini-Prima Vista complete Morrid's
Coffee sidequest and go to the Tantalus' hideout in Lindblum to get it. I
personally couldn't get the Mini-Prima Vista. The item is there in the hideout
and I can see it but I can't get it, but I was still able to get the S Rank
Medal, which means that although some people might not be able to get it, it
still counts for the S Class ranking, even though it doesn't appear in the key
items list.

  009. THE HOUSES OF TRENO                                           ID#03.009
»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»

There are two very important houses in Treno, the Auction House and the
Knight's House. In the Auction House you can bid for valuable items. In the
Knight's House you can battle powerful beasts for a prize.


» THE AUCTION HOUSE «
The Auction House sells important items and rare equipments. But you can't buy
anything unless you have a bit of money. Some items are more wanted than
others and this can make the price go up way beyond the item's real value. To
give your bid just get near the Auctioneer and press the X BUTTON. Now just
choose the amount you want to use... and good luck. Some items can be bought
and sold later for a higher price to certain people which is good to  raise
some quick money. Please note that this list is incomplete but these are the
most important items on sale.

Now, the most important rule when it comes to bidding it not to get yourself
in the middle of a bidding war. This can cause the prices to rise very
quickly, beyond a reasonable price. Let the nobles bid all they want, make a
bid moments before the end of the auction. This will help you lower the
average price of an item.

» THE KNIGHT'S HOUSE «
The Knight's House is actually the equipment shop of Treno. Downstairs you can
see a monster which will change over time. You can fight the monsters by
talking to the person taking care of the store and choosing to fight the
beast. Each time you defeat one of these beasts you will get a prize. Note
that these beasts change over time. If you missed one you won't be able to
fight it again.

  010. SECRETS OF THE QU                                             ID#03.010
»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»

All you need to know about Quina, Quale and Quan. Quale is Quina's master and
Quan was Quale's master. Quan was Vivi's grandfather and he was training Quale
before leaving him in the middle of his training. Quale now trains Quina, and
he helps him in the ways of the Qu.


» FROG SEASON «
From the beginning you can see that Quina likes frogs, a lot. And she can hunt
them in kind of a mini-game. In every Qu's Marshes there is a sort of lake
full of frogs, all Quina has to do is catch them to receive wonderful prizes
from Quan. There are four Qu's Marshes around Gaia, one in the Mist Continent,
one in the Outer Continent, one in the Forgotten Continent and one on the
Salvage Archipelago. The regeneration of the frogs is slow but there are ways
to speed up the process, first of all, never eat all the frogs. Try to leave
at least a male and female frog (they have different colors). Don't eat the
baby frogs, they'll eventually grow up and reproduce themselves and don't eat
the golden frogs, they lower the reproducing time. There's no technique or
trick to capture the frogs, just be patient and be ready.


  FROGS               REWARD
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  2 Frogs             Potion
  5 Frogs             Ether
  9 Frogs             Silk Robe
  15 Frogs            Elixir
  23 Frogs            Silver Fork
  33 Frogs            Bistro Fork
  45 Frogs            Battle Boots
  99 Frogs            Gastro Fork


After you eat your 99th frog Quale will come out. It's time for the student to
test his skills by facing the teacher. Quale isn't that hard to beat. All you
need is a good Auto-Reflect on your party. By doing this most of Quale's
status changing attacks will be harmless. But keep some Remedies ready, just
in case. All you need to watch out for is his Rolling Attack, nothing that a
Curaga spell can't handle. Attack and most importantly, steal his Robe of
Lords. He has one, so don't kill him before you get it. After the battle is
over you will receive the Gastro Fork. Quina can still continue to eat frogs
but at this point it's quite useless except for powering the Frog Drop.


» QUAN'S DWELLING «
After the destruction of Alexandria, stop by Quan's Dwelling with Vivi and
Quina. When you enter a funny scene will take place. Quina will see a lot of
food on the table and will start eating it. Unfortunately, it's all in his
imagination. After Quina goes onto the balcony he finds none other than Quan,
Vivi's grandfather. Quale will arrive moments later. We find out that Quan was
Quale's master and that he left his student in the middle of his training.
Quan claims to have discovered the meaning of life for the Qu. Eating food is
not about seeing it or feeling it, but rather imagining it. According to him,
anyone who imagines the food will be able to eat as much as they want. After
his explanation, Vivi will walk in. Quan says he tried to teach as much as he
could about the world to Vivi, he gained enough knowledge eventually,
knowledge enough for him to have an imagination. After that, Quan simply
disappears. Zidane could not see Quan during this whole discussion. After
that, if you examine the clock you can get some valuable Running Shoes.

  011. MONEY, POWER AND FAME                                         ID#03.011
»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»
«««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««
Thanks to Saynt for providing me with an alternative method on how to gain
some good amount of Gil.
»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»

During your quest there are three things to look out for. Experience, Ability
Points and Gil. There are several ways to get any of them. This part of the
guide will teach you some of those ways.


» MONEY «
Locate Chocobo's Paradise Treasure # 4, in Seatence Field, North of the Outer
Continent. Inside you will find 8 Straw Hat, 8 Pearl Armlet, 7 Aloha T-Shirt
and 8 Sandals (you can get the other Aloha T-Shirt from Moguta at Gizamaluke's
Grotto by giving her a Kupo Nut). When you sell them you will raise a whole
lot of money. The other option is to use Quina's Millionaire Ability and start
fighting or complete the various sidequests that many times award large
amounts of Gil, like the Mognet Central.

Another way is to go out and buy 99 Gysahl Greens (100 Gil each) and 99
Phoenix Downs (150 each). This goes for a total of 24.750 Gil. Take these
items to Hades and synthesize 99 Phoenix Pinions for a total of 29.700 Gil.
Now, you had a loss of 54.450 Gil but each Phoenix Pinion sells for 1000 Gil.
That means a grand total of 44.550 Gil in profit. Not only that but since that
in order to get to Hades you have to cross Memoria, you end up getting a lot
of experience and extra Gil. The only weak point about this is that you can
only do it later in the game, at which point you probably won't have any
purpose to the money. You can buy Gysahl Greens from Mene at a lower price so
in the end, you can actually raise your profit margin significantly.


» POWER «
An obvious way to get AP is to learn the technique Ability Up. This will
double your AP after battle. With Ability Up your characters will learn new
abilities in a flash. Now, all you have do is find a monster who gives away
some good amount of AP (just cruise around Memoria). The other way is to
complete the Spirits of Gaia sidequest (More information here: ID#03.006).
Each friendly monster will give away a good amount of AP. In fact you will
have received about 240 AP when you complete the quest. Another tip on
learning abilities is that, if you use two items from which you can extract
the same ability, the AP to learn that skill will be chopped in half making it
easier to learn it, and if you have Ability Up you will learn the ability in a
1/4 of the time.


» FAME «
In Vile Island to the South of Iifa Tree lives a terrifying monster that the
people of Gaia call Yan. Deep in the forest, these untamed beasts can match
your characters even at Lv.99. If you have Level Up equipped you can get to
Lv.99 in a few hours (More information here: ID#06.005). If you're still too
weak to defeat the Yans just head to Palmnell Island to the South of Daguerreo
and fight Grand Dragons (More information here: ID#06.005). If you prefer,
just visit Memoria and fight every monster you can find. Needless to say that
Level Up will be a great help, making you gain 50% more EXP than usual.

  012. THE REST OF THE QUEST                                         ID#03.012
»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»

This section is related to minor quests you can do along the game, or little
pieces of information about a particular part of the story that were otherwise
too small to star in a section of their own.


» FIGHT CLUB «
During the play "I want to be your canary", Zidane and Blank will perform a
small battle sequence. This is in fact a small game you can do to win some
pretty good amount of money and a valuable item. The item you get depends on
your ability to impress the nobles present in the crowd. If you impress them
all as well as Queen Brahne you'll get up to 10.000 Gil. When you're
controlling Steiner don't forget to talk to the Queen to collect your reward.


  NOBLES                       REWARD
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1-49 Nobles                  Ether
  50-79 Nobles                 Elixir
  80-99 Nobles                 Silk Shirt
  100 Nobles                   Moonstone


» DEPLOYING THE TROOPS «
When Alexandria is being attacked by Bahamut Garnet will have to deploy the
forces of Alexandria. Through the game, when you find these soldiers they give
you information on what exactly they do. If you order them correctly Beatrix
will give you the Angel Earrings.


  TROOPS                       TASK
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Weimar & Haagen              Protect the townspeople
  Breireicht & Laudo           Contact Lindblum
  Blutzen & Kohel              Gather information
  Mullenkedheim & Dojebon      Fire the cannons


» THE SECRETS OF DAGUERREO «
If you have the Namingway card in your collection you can rename you
characters. To do that just go on to Daguerreo and drop down to the balcony
through the stairs located near the Inn (they are kind of hidden). Anyway, if
you talk to a man he will notice your Namingway card and if you show it to
him, he will let you rename one of your characters.

Also in Daguerreo you can get the S Rank Medal. To get you must have all the
24 Chocograph treasures and the 8 Paradise treasures and all the figurines.
Just talk to the guy near the Moogle, Alleyway Jack. He'll look at your rank
and when he sees it he will runaway scared. Go back to the entrance and talk
to him again. He'll tell you his real name, but if you're a Final Fantasy
veteran you should already have guessed. He's also a treasure hunter. After a
little conversation he'll give you the medal that proves you found all the
treasures. Before showing your rank to Alleyway Jack fight him in a card
battle. He has most of the Ship Cards. So if you're missing some of those
cards you can get them now, because after he gives you the S Rank Medal he
will leave Daguerreo.


» THE EIDOLON WALL OF MADAIN SARI «
In Madain Sari there is a sanctuary where Eiko used to pray every day before
meeting Zidane. In DISC 4 the Eidolon Wall will be different and you will be
able to read various writings. Go to Eiko's kitchen with Zidane, Steiner,
Dagger and Eiko and you will see Lani although she runs away. Leave Madain
Sari and enter again but this time do it with Zidane, Quina, Steiner and Vivi
in your party. Go again to the kitchen and this time Lani won't runaway.
She'll tell you something about some carvings on the treasure chest in Eiko's
room. The writings say something about going clockwise and counter clockwise
9 times. Go to the Eidolon Wall and rotate clockwise (to the right) until you
reach the door again. When you do, you'll hear a sound. Now go counter
clockwise (to the left) until you hear the same sound. Repeat this 9 times
and you will be healed. Now you can see writings you couldn't see before. The
main reason to do this minor quest is to learn Garnet's real name. Her real
father left a message on the Eidolon Wall to his wife Jane and his daughter
Sarah that were on a boat and were lost on the night of the big storm.


» THE RING OF FOSSIL ROO «
This is a game many people don't care to play and most don't even know it
exists. The game consists in you digging up for treasures. In Fossil Roo
you'll eventually end up in a section where a treasure hunter awaits you. Give
him a Potion so he can lend you his tool. Now, first of all break down the top
wall and Kuppo will come out. Don't forget the letter he has for you. Now,
most of the rewards are lame but if you wait you can eventually gain a
Madain's Ring. As far as I know, that's the best prize you can get and the
only reason for you to play this game. Be patient. It can take a while for the
ring to show up.


» FINAL FANTASY III'S ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK «
At the Black Mage's Village you can hear the OST of Final Fantasy III. First
of all, you have to be on DISC 4. You'll also need to have the Une's Mirror
and the Doga's Artifact. You can buy both of them at the Treno's Auction
House. Once you have them, start playing the gramophone at the village's inn
and the songs playing will be from Final Fantasy III.


» THE ULTIMATE WEAPONS «
Every character will have an ultimate weapon. That is, the most powerful
weapon in the game. If you're having troubles finding them, here's a full list
of them

Once you leave Lindblum trying to reach Gizamaluke's Grotto make a little
detour and go on through the bridge into a strange looking forest that you saw
with the telescope back when you were in the castle's balcony. In here you
will see a Chocobo and a Moogle, the Chocobo will run away. Mene, the Moogle
will give you some Gysahl Green, a Chocobo's favorite food. All you need to do
is use the Gysahl Green near some Chocobo tracks and he will come right away.
With the Chocobo you can ride without facing any monsters which is quite
useful, but most importantly, you will be able to dig up treasures and items
with your Chocobo.

After calling Choco using the Gysahl Green on the tracks near the forest enter
the forest again and Mene will tell you a big secret. He will explain you that
in that forest Choco can dig up various items for a small price. To dig you
only need to use the SQUARE BUTTON, depending on the noise Choco makes you can
guess if you're close or far from the treasure, that's why the game is called
Chocobo Hot and Cold.


  CLUE                MEANING
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Kweh                Cold
  Kweh!?              Mild
  Kwehhh!?            Warm
  K-KWEHHH!!!         Jackpot


When you find a treasure a number will pop up, this number represents how deep
the treasure is buried. Valuable items are buried deeper underground. When it
reaches 0 you will get the treasure. Every item also represents a certain
number of points, these points are used to increase Choco's beak level but
also to trade for items. Mene will give you a list of thing you can buy with
the points you gain.


  ITEM                      POINTS REQUIRED
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Robe of Lords             10.000 Points
  Protect Ring              8500 Points
  Wing Edge                 3500 Points
  Viltgance Card            1800 Points
  Ether                     450 Points
  Ore                       250 Points
  Phoenix Down              150 Points
  Gysahl Green              10 Points


Chocobo's Forest is the first of many digging spots. Each one of them will
have different rules and prizes. These digging spots may also need Choco to
learn a particular skill before being reachable.


 CHOCOBO'S FOREST
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can only dig for a minute and you pay Mene 60 Gils per game. If within
this minute you find and dig 4 items you will get a bonus of +10 sec. and
every item you dig from that moment on will count double. Another rule is the
5 sec. timing. Let's say you dig up a certain item, if you dig another item
within 5 sec. you will get a bonus of 5 points. If you manage to get 8 items
Mene will force you to stop giving you a bonus according to the time left. A
new area will be available when you get the Mountain Chocobo. Choco will be
able to reach the ledges you couldn't reach before.


 CHOCOBO'S LAGOON
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This Lagoon is located on the Salvage Archipelago and you can only reach it
when you get the Reef Ability. The way to the Lagoon is like a maze but not
that hard to figure out. You need to land your airship in a nearby island and
use Choco to reach the Lagoon.

There are new rules in the Lagoon, half-time, half-price. 30 Gil for a 30 sec.
play. Also, it will be harder to dig because items will be buried deeper. If
you find 4 items Mene will force you to stop giving the bonus you deserve and
also, that 5 sec. timing will now award you with 10 points instead of 5. Once
again a new area will be opened later on. This time you will need the Ocean
Chocobo so you can go deeper into the Lagoon.


 CHOCOBO'S AIR GARDEN
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To begin with, you will need a Golden Chocobo, after that you will need some
Dead Pepper. Now, the Air Garden keeps on moving throughout Gaia. There are
a total of five locations:


 1 - To the North of the Salvage Archipelago
 2 - Near Alexandria, close to the sea
 3 - South of the Desert Palace
 4 - Near Ipsen's Castle
 5 - Right in the centre of the world map


Anyway, you can locate the Air Garden by a relatively big circled shadow on
the ground. When you locate it, give a Dead Pepper to Choco while he's flying.
Make sure you're right under the shadow. When you leave the Air Garden it will
be permanently located on the map. Once again you will be able to dig up for a
whole minute and you will receive a lot more points for each item. The 5 sec.
timing will increase, this time you will receive 15 points. In the Air Garden
there will be 2 sections, sometimes a treasure might not be in the section you
are currently at and so Choco will need to move on to the other island which
can consume a lot of time.


 CHOCOBO'S PARADISE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After collecting all Chocographs you will be able to reach the Chocobo's
Paradise. The Paradise is located in a very familiar spot, the corner of the
map, where you could find the Knights of the Round in Final Fantasy VII and
the Deep Sea Research Centre in Final Fantasy VIII. Head to that spot and you
will see a little island with a forest and a mountain that hides the entrance
to the Paradise.

In the Chocobo's Paradise you will see the Fat Chocobo. He will ask Choco to
stay in the Paradise with him and the other Chocobo's but Mene will tell them
that Choco isn't ready yet and so you can keep on searching for more treasures
with Choco. Now, the Chocobo's in the Paradise will give you a hint on the
location of a few more treasures. Beware that some Chocobo's give you two
locations (if you talk to a Chocobo with the X BUTTON he will give you a
location but if you talk to him with the SQUARE BUTTON he might give you
another hint).


To move on to other digging spot, Choco will have to learn new abilities. As
he develops, he will be able to cross various kinds of terrains. Choco can
gain various new abilities every time he visits the Chocobo's Dream World. To
reach this dream world you will need to find the location of some specific
Chocographs.

It's digging time, just bring your Chocobo and he will do the rest. Well, now
it's time to give a use for all those Chocographs you've been digging up. Each
one of them shows an image of the location you need to find and a bit of
information to help your search. To allocate a Chocograph on the search mode
just open the Chocograph menu and choose the Chocograph you want to search
for. Choco cannot find the treasure unless he has the Chocograph, even if you
already know its location. Anyway, the menu also shows your current abilities
and the abilities you need to catch the treasure, which will also give you a
hint on the location of the Chocograph (if a Chocograph requires the ability
to cross mountains it won't be hidden in the ocean, it will probably be in a
mountain or in a place you can only reach if you cross a mountain).

  003. THE PARADISE TREASURES                                        ID#04.003
»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»

All of the Paradise Treasures require that you use a Dead Pepper on Choco. You
can get a lot of Dead Peppers if you talk to the Chocobo sitting next to the
Fat Chocobo but in the beginning you need to dig them like every other Chocobo
in the world at the Chocobo's Forest/Lagoon/Air Garden. Now, Dead Peppers
enhance certain abilities in Choco. To use it open the Chocobo Menu and choose
to feed him with a Dead Pepper.


 1 - If Choco is in the ground when you use it he will dig frenetically. If
     you're near a crack, it will open and you can get treasures or find
     entrances to special places.
 2 - If Choco is on the sea he will dive furiously and if there are any
     treasures underwater he will get them.
 3 - If the Chocobo is flying he will spread his wings and fly. This ability
     is only needed to reach the Air Garden.


Here are all the locations of the treasures. There are a total of 8 treasures
To be found, and the locations are revealed to you by many Chocobos at the
Paradise and by the Fat Chocobo too. Beware that some Chocobo's give you two
locations (if you talk to a Chocobo with the X BUTTON he will give you a
location but if you talk to him with the SQUARE BUTTON he might give you
another location).

Since you don't have any Chocographs to guide you, there are other ways to
find the treasures. There are 2 different clues. If the treasure is on land
there will be a crack to mark the spot. If the treasure is underwater there
will be bubbles on the surface.


 PARADISE TREASURE #1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Location:    In Quan's Dwelling. Enter with Zidane, without Choco. Approach
             the ledge on the balcony and examine the (!). Feed Choco with a
             Dead Pepper and dive.
Reward:      9 Ore, 1 Red Rose Card, 1 Tiger Racket, 15 Topaz


 PARADISE TREASURE #2

Location     North of Oeilvert, in a mountain you'll find a crack.

             Ring


 PARADISE TREASURE #3

 PARADISE TREASURE #7

             of the map a bit up North. It's hard but you'll find it.

There's a final quest to do with Choco. Visit all the beaches and shores in
the world to gain a cool healing power. When you're at a beach, press the
CIRCLE BUTTON and you will hear a sound. Do this in every single beach of the
world. You don't need to do it with Choco, you can use the Invincible to visit
every beach and although it seems hard it's quite easy, the problem is that if
you miss a small shore it will be hard to find out which one you missed, so
try to get a map to signal the beaches you already visited. Anyway, when you
do this you will gain a healing power. Press the CIRCLE BUTTON on any beach
and you will be automatically healed. It doesn't work on any corner of the
globe, only in beaches and shores, but it will be incredibly useful when
fighting the Grand Dragons later on.

you will get to play a little bit of twenty-one, Blackjack. Quite boring I'll
say, but as a secret, I have the duty to show it.

There are 3 games you can play in Alexandria. The 1st one is the jump rope. To
play talk to the girls playing the game when you gain control of Vivi in the
beginning of the game, or later on in DISC 4.

Jump Rope is hard at the beginning because of the camera view, you can do it
the first time if you want to get the cards (they might be useful in the
beginning). After Alexandria is destroyed the girls will appear again, this
time in the chapel of Alexandria, this time Eiko can play too. While playing
the game press the X BUTTON when you see the (!). This will make Vivi or Eiko
jump. At the beginning it's easy, but at 20 jumps the speed will increase,
again at 50 jumps and at 100 jumps. At 200 jumps the speed will decrease a
little bit. From 300 onward, the speed will remain the same. Depending on the
number of jumps you do you can get various rewards.


  JUMPS                REWARD

The other game in Alexandria is the racing game. When you return to Alexandria
and you get to control Vivi alone, talk to Hippaul's mother (she's on one of
the streets) and you can choose to race against Hippaul.

By playing with Hippaul you can get various items. Talk to Hippaul's mother in
the streets of Alexandria on DISC 3. Once the game begins, quickly press the
CIRCLE and SQUARE BUTTONS alternately (I advice you to change the button
configuration because the normal configuration makes it hard to pull it off).
At start Hippaul will be slow, really slow, but he will raise his level as he
runs until he reaches a point when he's unbeatable. His mom will give you
prizes every time he reaches a certain level.

If you missed Hippaul's mom in Alexandria or didn't care to win the Athlete
Queen then you can forget about it since you'll never be able to race him ever
again, if you really want the key item do not leave town without it. You can
race Hippaul even after you got the Athlete Queen but it will be just a waste
of time if you ask me.

  004. THE NERO BROTHERS                                             ID#05.004

At the beginning of DISC 3 in Alexandria's Weapon Shop you can find Benero,
Genero and Zenero, these guys want to play a game with you. You have to bet
some money and then you need to memorize who is who. The brothers will shuffle
positions and in the end they will ask you where is one of the brothers
(because of that you need to remember all the 3 brothers and not only 1). If
you win, you'll receive all the money you betted and some more for winning the
bet. After that the brothers will ask you to quit and collect your reward or
to keep on playing, if you do, the bets will increase and so do the profits.
You can keep playing to a max of 25600 Gil. Personally, I find it useless, the
lower levels don't give you almost any Gil and the higher levels are too hard
so you're most likely to lose money instead of winning. There are better ways
to make some Gil.

Thanks to Jeff who gave me Ozma's stats and George Buttner for the tip on
Eiko's Holy against him.
»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»

For those who don't know, Ozma is the toughest and most powerful enemy in the
whole game. You can find him in Chocobo's Air Garden when you examine a rock
that looks a bit strange. If you proceed on examining the rock despite Mene's
warning, Ozma will come out to fight you.

Many people told me Ozma is very hard. I personally had more troubles to
defeat Kuja than this guy. First of all, do the Spirits of Gaia sidequest
(More information here: ID#03.006). If you don't do it, Ozma will be out of
range to physical attacks. Now, there's something that you need to get about
Ozma. He has two different sides. A light side and a dark side. The side on
top will determine Ozma's weakness. If the dark side is on top, Ozma will
absorb Holy but he'll be weak against Shadow attacks. If the light side is on
top, Ozma will absorb Shadow attacks but he'll be weak against Holy. Ozma
rotates from time to time, so it's hard to take advantage of his weaknesses.

Now, personally, I had a harder time beating Trance Kuja than this guy. My
characters were on a Lv.62 average. Zidane kept doing 9999 points of damage
with Thievery. Steiner did the same with Shock. Now, Vivi can be a good bet,
although he will only reach his true potential when he's able to cast
Doomsday, if at the time Ozma is absorbing Shadow damage, just use powerful
non-elemental attacks. I also used Eiko and she kept using Madeen and Holy if
Ozma didn't absorb it (Holy will do some good amount of damage if you equip
the White Robe).

About your Support Abilities, first of all have all your party on
Auto-Reflect. You can prevent almost half of Ozma's attacks this way. Have
Eiko with Reflect-Null to do the Healing. Equip Return Magic too. Except for
Curse, Flare Star and Absorb MP you can return all of Ozma's attacks. Auto
regenerative skills are also important, specially Auto-Potion and Auto-Regen.
Try to boost your HP with HP increasing abilities. Protect your party from
status like Slow, Mini and Confuse (Ozma has an attack called Curse that
induces these and other status ailments, but these are the most annoying).

The most important attack you need to avoid is Doomsday, to do that equip
items that protect of absorb Shadow damage. After that just keep attacking and
healing. Try to keep more than half of you HP at all times. When you beat Ozma
you will receive the Strategy Guide. This key item gives you not only a hint
on how to have the highest score at Tetra Master but it's also the proof that
you defeated Ozma.

In Memoria you can find the Legendary Synthesist, a mythical person that can
create the finest and rarest items. Before fighting Kraken, in the screen that
looks like the ocean, search behind the rocks. Keep on pressing the X BUTTON
until someone talks to you. Hades will fight you.

Hades may seem terrifying but he's not that big of a threat. Most importantly
equip items that protect of absorb Shadow damage. It is essential that you
protect your characters from most status ailments, specially, Slow, Mini and
Confuse. Return Magic's not a good bet because even though most of Hades'
attacks are returnable, you would also be returning Doomsday and in essence,
healing Hades.

Before going into battle, put all your characters on the back row. Use Long
Reach for those characters that use physical attacks, otherwise Hades will use
Cleave and that can wipe out your front row members. Other than that Hades is
not that hard. Attack with your most powerful skills and magic. After an
exhausting fight, Hades will consider you a worthy opponent and offers his
services as a master synthesist.

The Tantarian is one cool and very hard to beat monster. He's at Alexandria's
Castle Library, inside a book and you can fight him just before meeting with
Garnet and Eiko at the top of the Castle in DISC 3. If you've been stealing a
lot with Zidane there shouldn't be a problem.


  TANTARIAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Level        41
  Type         Demon
  HP           21.997
  MP           1456
  AP           30
  EXP          12.585
  Gil          4472


  Attacks      Edge, Doom, Poison, Paper Storm

  Defense      Shadow (50% protection)
               Petrify, Zombie, Stop, Float, Doom, Venom, Death, Poison, Heat,
               Mini, Silence, Confuse, Sleep, Freeze, Trouble, Berserk,
               Regen, Vanish

  Weakness     Holy

  Steal        Demons's Mail, Elixir, Ether, Silver Fork

  Reward       Ramuh Card, Running Shoes


The most important thing to remember before fighting the Tantarian is to
protect everyone with Antibody. This monster is tricky because most of the
time he'll be with the book closed. When he's like this, he will use most of
his attacks and not only that but he'll be almost immune to any attack you do.
To make him open up, attack him physically. For instance, if Zidane attacks
for 100 HP, Tantarian will open page 100. To make Tantarian reveal himself
you'll have to find out the page he's in. Try different sequences of physical
attacks and remember them because once you find out the sequence all you need
to do is repeat and he'll be found again.

When he's open, do not attack him physically. That will just make him close
once again, instead use all the magic you got. During this time, all Tantarian
will do is attack you with Poison, which shouldnt really bother you. Once he
hides, repeat the sequence you used to find him and attack with magic once
again. If you've been leveling up consistently during the game there shouldnt
be a problem.

Necron, the bringer of death. He's the final enemy you'll have to face. After
Kuja's defeat, choose your characters for battle and step up to stop him from
destroying the universe.


  NECRON
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Level        39
  Type         Demon, Flying
  HP           54.100
  MP           9999
  AP           0
  EXP          0
  Gil          0


  Attacks      Blue Shockwave, Firaga, Blizzaga, Thundaga, Flare, Shell,
               Protect, Neutron Ring, Grand Cross

  Defense      Earth (avoid)
               Petrify, Trouble, Berserk, Slow, Vanish, Venom, Zombie, Stop,
               Heat, Mini, Silence, Death, Poison, Darkness, Confusion,
               Sleep

  Weakness     Holy, Wind

  Steal        Elixir

  Reward       None


Preparing for this battle is essential. You'll have an opportunity to do so
after you defeat Kuja. The first thing you have to remember is that, Necron
isn't that difficult. First of all, protect your party from every status
ailment possible and use the remaining stones to Auto-Reflect. If you can
equip Auto-Regen and Auto-Potion as well. Now, Auto-Reflect will protect you
from the minor attacks. The greatest problem with Necron is his Grand Cross
that inflicts your party members with every status effect. He also tends to
unleash the Neutron Ring that can seriously damage your party and the Blue
Shockwave that reduces a character's HP to 1.

To defeat this final boss throw him with all you got, and I do mean
everything. If you're using Amarant, throw every item in your inventory. If
you have Dark Matter, use it. Use every character's most powerful attacks.
Zidane should be doing 9999 by know and so should Steiner. A healing character
is essential. I prefer Eiko because she can also do a good amount of damage
with Holy. Keep attacking and Healing and try not to let you HP get below 3000
because Necron might strike with a Neutron Ring and you're done for. Besides
that, he's not that difficult.

and to ffonline.com for the stats of the Grand Dragon.
»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»

All around the islands near Daguerreo you can find one of the most untamed
beasts in Gaia. The very powerful Grand Dragons. Now, these green guys can be
though, but not if you know what to do.


  GRAND DRAGON
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Level        60
  Type         Dragon
  HP           13.206
  MP           2550
  AP           3
  EXP          35.208
  Gil          2604


  Attacks      Poison Claw, Thundaga, Venom Breath

  Defense      Lightning (50% protection)
               Silence, Confusion, Darkness, Vanish

  Weakness     Ice

  Steal        Ether, Rising Sun, Tent

  Reward       Ether, Grand Dragon Card, Phoenix Down


Now, Grand Dragons are perfect for leveling up when you're on lower levels.
Most attacks are avoidable. Just equip Auto-Reflect and Antibody. This will
make him almost inoffensive. Auto-Haste is recommended to speed up the battle
and also the Level Up and Ability Up. This is all you need to defeat these
dragons, which is also perfect to power-up Freya's Dragon's Crest.

I also recommend doing the Healing Sands sidequest (More information here:
ID#04.004). Once you complete it you will be able to heal yourself in any
beach on Gaia by pressing the CIRCLE BUTTON. If you wanna fight the Grand
Dragons head to Palmnell Island (from Chocobo's Lagoon) and go into battle.
After you win just heal and prepare yourself for another round. This saves a
lot of time and tents and you can use all the powerful techniques in battle
and replenish your MP quickly.

Besides that, there isn't much to say about Grand Dragons. They aren't that
difficult so you shouldn't have too much trouble. Just develop your characters
until they're good enough to fight the Yans. If you're trying the easy
approach, just use Quina's Lv.5 Death for an instant kill.

Compared to these babies, Ozma can sometimes seem like a little kid's ball
than an ultimate boss. A single Yan can easily wipe out your entire party.
Knowing how to deal with them might just help you survive. To find them just
head to Vile Island, Southwest of the Iifa Tree.


  YAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Level        72
  Type         Normal
  HP           19.465
  MP           3378
  AP           3
  EXP          42.673
  Gil          2218


  Attacks      Snort, Comet, Aera, Virus Powder, Float

  Defense      Holy (50% protection)
               Silence, Berserk, Confusion, Vanish

  Weakness     Shadow

  Steal        Elixir, Ore

  Reward       Ether, Hi-Potion, Phoenix Down, Zemzelett Card


The problem with Yans is that they usually come in packs of three. If a Yan is
a threat, three Yans are a serious problem. You need to defeat them quick and
with the least possible number of turn. If you're fighting Yans your
characters have to hit for 9999 of damage. A Yan's worst ability is the Snort.
A Snort will immediately and permanently remove a party member from battle
preventing him or her from winning any AP or EXP. They use Snort as a
counter-attack, as well as Float. This is why you should focus all your power
on a single Yan and avoid the attacks that damage every enemy. This lowers
your change of getting yourself snorted. Comet, as you know, deals a random
amount of damage, but a single one can kill you easily.

Auto-Life, Auto-Potion and Auto-Regen are essential. Auto-Haste is advisable
since the Yans are fast as well as HP boosting abilities. Also, equip everyone
Insomniac and use Quina's Night. The Yans will fall asleep. At this point you
can use Doomsday, if you are protected against Shadow damage or Eidolons,
especially Odin that usually kills the Yans if you have enough Ore in your
inventory. The best part of making the Yans fall asleep is that they won't
counter-attack your moves. Comet will always be a Yan's worst attack. The good
part of a Comet is the 33% change it has of failing. So, try to boost your
Magic Evade. Level Up and Ability Up are good to speed up the whole process
and making your characters stronger.

With two hits at 9999 you can kill a Yan. If you're still not getting it with
a specific ability don't use it. This is to minimize the counters a Yan will
do and thereby reducing the chances of a character being snorted. The Virus
can be a good status effect in the end. By leaving all except one character
affected by the Virus, you can get almost 200.000 EXP (if you're fighting
three Yans and only one character remains to receive experience). And that's
all for the Yans. Don't forget to save frequently and soon enough you'll be at
Lv.99.

Tetra Master is simple to learn but hard to master. The game field is a 4x4
cell board. You have to place your cards on the board. Some cells are blocked
and you can't place any card there, this means that some strategy may be
required to win. Every card has arrows (at least most of them) these arrows
indicate which direction a card can attack or defend. Each card also has
number and letters:

The 1st number represents the card's attack power and the letter determines
which type of attack it is. M stands for Magical Attack and P stands for
Physical Attack (eventually a card will level up and the attack type will
change to X, which means that the card will choose the lowest defense or to A,
in which the card will choose the lowest number, regardless of what that
number stands for). The 2nd number represents the physical defense while the
3rd number represents the magical defense (eventually a card will level up and
the attack type will increase). Usually, cards with higher levels will win in
battle. In the beginning of a game you will need to choose 5 cards from your
list. A coin is tossed to determine who begins first.

To conquer a card you can either make it easily by placing a card next to an
enemy card that has no arrows facing back at your card. If there is an arrow
pointing at the opposite direction of your arrow, a battle will ensue. To win
you have to defeat the other card by dropping its HP to 0. This depends on the
attack power and the defense of the cards in battle. Beware that cards (just
like your party members) will weaken if you use them constantly. Their HP will
be less than normal and they may also have more difficulties to conquer other
cards.

After some battles, cards will evolve. Attack and Defense begin as numbers,
ranging from 1 to 9. After that they will turn to letters, ranging from A to
F. The higher the number, the more powerful a particular stat will be. The
same goes for the letters.

In the end, the player with the most cards of his color will win. Unless
there's a draw and then no one looses any card. When you win you may choose
one of the opponent's card but only those which you were able to turn blue. If
you make a perfect game by turning all the cards blue you can have all of the
opponent's cards.

Around the world there are cards to be found. Most of them are easy to get. To
help you out here's a little list of locations. Except for the Namingway, the
locations are all from DISC 4 to make the life of those who went on to get
Excalibur II easier, although some of them are available before that.

  #1 - ABOUT BRAHNE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Queen Brahne was the ruler of the Kingdom of Alexandria. Alexandria was one of
the most powerful nations on the continent but the Queen eventually started
showing some erratic behavior. This coincided with the appearance of a strange
man named Kuja. Kuja told the Queen about the Alexandrian National Jewel and
about the three other sister jewels that combined could bring forth a power
greater than any other. The recently widowed Queen saw this as the opportunity
to expand the Empire of Alexandria and using the weapons provided by Kuja she
was quick to crush the neighboring nations.

The Queen was even ready to sacrifice her own daughter for the great power and
after Garnet left with the jewel she used all her powers to get it back. She
even ordered Zorn and Torn to extract Garnet's Eidolons to use in her
conquering efforts during a brief time when she held her own daughter captive.

In the end she rebelled against Kuja, the only threat to her total domination
and summoned Bahamut, the Kind of Dragons to destroy him but Kuja subverted
the Eidolon and unleashed him upon its summoner. The queen managed to escape
on her emergency pod but her wounds were fatal and she eventually died on the
beach, but not before showing her regrets to Garnet.


  #2 - ABOUT KUJA
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kuja was a Genome, a being created by Garland as the first part of the Angel
of Death Project. Unlike the other Genomes Kuja was special, he had a soul.
Garland considered him too powerful to be a proper vessel, and even considered
discarding him, but Kuja's power amazed him and after that he created the
project. After finding out about the second part of the project and the
arrival of a second and more powerful Genome Kuja rebelled against his
creator. When the second Angel of Death was created, eight years after Kuja
was given life, Kuja could not accept his fate and four years after he left
Garland, taking Zidane with him and abandoning the child in Gaia. After that,
Kuja vowed to prove Garland wrong and to show him that he was more powerful
and better suited for the job and that Zidane was in fact weaker than he was.
To disrupt the flow of souls, Kuja required war. To wage war he was going to
need weapons. Using the Mist he created the Black Mages, soulless dolls with
powerful magic. Kuja set up an underground factory in Dali and began producing
the Black Mages but he still needed someone greedy and power-hungry enough to
start a war. Eventually he convinced Brahne with the story of the Four Jewels.

Meanwhile, Kuja began a new part of his plan, to prove that he was in fact
better than Garland ever was. He convinced Brahne to extract Garnet's
Eidolons. He was prepared to be betrayed by the Queen and when she eventually
did by unleashing Bahamut, Kuja was ready and used the powers of the
Invincible to corrupt the Dragon King and make him attack Brahne's fleet. But
to defeat Garland, Kuja was going to need a more powerful Eidolon. He was
going to need Alexander, the Holy Summon. By attacking Alexandria he hoped to
lead Garnet to summon Alexander and she did, but at the same time, Garland was
already aware of Kuja's plans and seized control of the Invincible once again.
Failing to acquire Alexander, Kuja searched for another Eidolon. He kidnapped
Eiko to extract her summons but Mog protected her and entered a Trance. Kuja
was amazed by this power and so he returned to Terra and by using the flow of
souls from the Invincible he was able to reach a state of Trance. Kuja was
quick to defeat Zidane and to push Garland to his death. But the old man said
that his victory was doomed to be short-lived, because he was a Genome
designed to be eventually replaced by the second Angel of Death. Much like the
Black Mages, Kuja was meant to die. This pushed Kuja over the limit, and he
completely destroyed Terra. Then, with his new powers he created Memoria and
through it he managed to reach the Crystal, source of all life and what
maintained balance in the universe. Unable to defeat Zidane and his party,
Kuja unleashed Ultima as a last attempt to destroy everything. When the
Crystal was broken, the Eternal Darkness, Necron came out and planned to
destroy the current universe and build a new one. Having lost his Trance and
with his death imminent Kuja used his last shred of powers to help Zidane and
his friends to defeat Necron and to transport them back to safety. Zidane went
back to save his brother, trapped in the Iifa Tree. Kuja eventually died,
regretting for the pain and sorrow he caused and for not realizing the true
purpose of life.


  #3 - ABOUT ZIDANE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Zidane is a thief and a member of Tantalus. The leader of Tantalus is Baku,
who adopted Zidane when he was four. Zidane has no memories of his childhood
or his origin. In fact, Zidane is a Genome, the second part of the Angel of
Death Project, developed by Garland. Zidane was meant to grow up and to
eventually be more powerful than Kuja. Kuja never accepted his fate so he took
Zidane and left him to die on Gaia but Zidane survived. During his adventure
Zidane falls in love with Princess Garnet. Usually he tries to act as a
romantic hero, failing most of the time.

Since he was abandoned at age four, he was never educated by Garland, he never
got to know his purpose of existence. In the end he fights his creator and
stops the very process he was supposed to help with. It is impossible to say
if Garland searched for Zidane or if he just considered him a lost Genome.
Garland usually seems to sympathize with Zidane but we can't say if he ever
worried about his disappearance, besides he was quick to find a replacement
(although we can't tell when Mikoto was created, given her appearance it seems
that she was probably created after Zidane's disappearance. By Garland's
speech at Pandemonium we learn that although he suspected Kuja from the
beginning he was at that point unable to confirm his involvement in the
incident or to give up his services. Garland probably considered that Zidane
was likely dead.


  #4 - ABOUT MIKOTO AND THE GENOMES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Much like Zidane was meant to eventually step up and take Kuja's place, Mikoto
was created as the third part of the Angel of Death Project. It is impossible
to tell when Mikoto was created or why. She was either meant to take Zidane's
place or to take Kuja's place after he left Zidane on Gaia. Since Garland
never recovered Zidane it is possible that he created Mikoto to fill in the
void left by Zidane. Another possibility is that Garland knew that Zidane was
not dead, even though he didn't know where he was but that he would eventually
return home to fulfill his destiny and created Mikoto to eventually take his
place.

The rest of the Genomes are soulless vessels. When Terra completely
assimilates Gaia, the souls of the people of Terra will fill the Genomes as
they awaken. After the destruction of Terra, the Genomes start living in the
Black Mage Village. They are empty of knowledge but they are  conscientious
and willing to learn. Only Mikoto never seems completely satisfied by the
move. She was meant to have a different goal in life.


  #5 - ABOUT GARLAND AND THE ANGEL OF DEATH PROJECT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Garland is in charge of bringing back the people of Terra. After the planet
began a path to its own destruction the people when to a deep sleep. Garland
was created to oversee the restoration of Terra. To complete that restoration,
Gaia has to become Terra. His first attempt ended in failure when he tried to
take Gaia by force. But in the end that almost led to his own destruction.
This way Garland waited many years and devised a more complex plan. Garland's
only fear was the power of Eidolons and he destroyed the Summoners' Village so
that the people of Gaia could never again learn about such power.

In Bran Bal, Garland gave birth to a project, the Angel of Death Project. The
project was meant to create an assistant for Garland, someone to help him
speed up the cycle of souls, to submerge Gaia into an unstoppable war. For
that he created Kuja. Kuja was the first part of the project. He was meant to
be a first assistant. Kuja was born 24 years ago. Eight years after, Garland
created Zidane. Zidane was created as a more advanced version and a more
powerful Genome than Kuja. The first Angel of Death never accepted the
existence of his successor, so he left him to die on Gaia. Kuja followed
Garland's plan, by convincing Queen Brahne to wage war. But he never forgot
that Garland tried to substitute him. Still, Garland needed a new Genome to
serve his purposes. He created Mikoto, the third Angel of Death. Although
Mikoto is part of the project, her services where never required. Meanwhile,
Kuja was seeking a way to surpass even Garland. The old man managed to stop
his plans at first but eventually Kuja reached Trance, killed Garland and
destroyed Terra. The remaining memories of Garland, or perhaps his spirit
still help Zidane and his friends at Memoria, by teaching them and guiding
them to Kuja.

Some have speculated that Garland is actually the Final Fantasy I Garland who
fought and was defeated by the Light Warriors. Although not likely, I am
forced to say that it is not impossible. FFI takes place in an unknown world
with three large continents and the balance is maintained by Four Elemental
Crystals. The story begins with the Four Crystals going dark and causing chaos
through the land. A prophecy is made, in which Four Light Warriors will appear
and restore order. One day, Four Knights appear in the Kingdom of Coneria. The
princess had been kidnapped by a rogue knight named Garland. The Light
Warriors defeat the knight and save Princess Sara. But the real adventure is
to destroy the Four Elemental Fiends, spread throughout the world, Lich in
Melmond, Maliris on Mt. Gulg (Gulug), Kraken in the underwater palace and
Tiamat on the sky fortress. Their defeat restores the Crystals and the balance
of the world. But the Four Beasts have created a demon using the body of
Garland, Chaos. In an ultimate battle the Four Light Warriors defeat the dark
monster and restore the flow of time.

In the world of Final Fantasy we have three major continents, the seal to
Terra is maintained by the Four Elemental Shrines, guarded by the Four
Elemental Fiends and their appearances are very similar in both games. Also,
places like Oeilvert obviously show that ancient civilizations once inhabited
the planet. Some speculate that much like Garland created the Genomes and he
was created by the people of Terra, there could also be clones of Garland. The
process of assimilation by Terra is known to be slow, so it's possible that
this was the same, or a clone of Garland. He himself states the fact that he
once tried to rule the world (but this may be a reference to his first attempt
to turn Gaia into Terra by seizing the power of the Eidolons). Once again,
this possibility is improbable, but it is a possibility.


  #6 - ABOUT VIVI AND THE BLACK MAGES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vivi and the rest of the Black Mages are spawned from Mist using an unknown
process which Kuja briefly describes as he mocks Vivi: "Begin with broth of
Mist, add fermented souls, and boil... Then, pour genuine black magic into a
mixing bowl and heat-". The Mist itself is a by-product of the refining
process that occurs in the Iifa Tree.

Vivi was created as a prototype, the first version of the Black Mages. It is
uncertain exactly where Vivi as created or when. Even his adoption by Quale is
never fully explained. As a prototype, his lifespan is bigger than that of the
other Black Mages but he will eventually stop. The Black Mages start as
lifeless dolls, and the process of them gaining life and a consciousness is
never explained in detail. The only information we have comes from Quan. When
you meet him at Quan's Dwelling he says he tried to teach Vivi all about the
outside world, and Vivi learned a lot, enough for him to develop an
imagination of his own. Apparently, this explains exactly how the Black Mages
come to life, through knowledge and experience.

One of the greatest parts of the game is the ending sequence in which a Black
Mage arrives in Alexandria, much like Vivi did in the beginning. He eventually
reveals himself to be Vivi's son. It is impossible to say if Vivi's offspring
were in fact created much like the other Black Mages were or if they are the
consequence of a real relationship. Such aspect of the game is never revealed.

The rest of the Black Mages are created by Kuja in an underground facility in
Dali. From there they are shipped to Alexandria Castle and used in the war
against Alexandria's neighboring nations. But some Black Mages gain conscience
on the battlefield and flee. Eventually they set up a village on the Outer
Continent. Their lifespan is reduced when compared to Vivi, and when their
time is up they simply stop. Because of that, Black Mages developed a
different concept of what is death and of life after that.


  #7 - ABOUT GARNET AND EIKO
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Garnet and Eiko are both the remaining survivors of the Summoner Tribe. They
had the power to bring forth spirits of legends and employ their power in
battle. Garland feared them more than everything on Gaia but at first he
sought to gain that same power to serve his purposes. He tried to summon
Alexander and failed. The result meant the destruction of the original
Summoners' Village. After that, fearing the power of Alexander the tribe broke
the jewel in four and scattered the pieces through the Mist Continent. Their
village remained destroyed so those that survived moved to the Outer Continent
and founded Madain Sari. But Garland, unable to use the power of the Eidolons,
destroyed the village with the power of the Invincible. Garnet and her mother
were on a boat that day and were cast away. The boat ended up in Alexandria.
Garnet survived but her mother died. She was adopted by the King and Queen of
Alexandria. After the destruction of Madain Sari only a few Summoners
survived. By the time Zidane and his friends reach the village only Eiko
remains.

Summoners are characterized by a horn. The horn bestows them with the power to
speak with Eidolons. This is how they train. Apparently, the fact that Garnet
no longer has a horn and is unable to communicate with the Eidolons does not
prevent her from summoning them. Garnet's name is engraved in the Eidolon
Wall. Her name is Sarah. As far as we can tell from the game, there is no
evidence that Garnet and Eiko are related, but since they are part of a small
tribe, that possibility should not be discarded.


  #8 - ABOUT NECRON AND THE CRYSTAL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Necron lived in a world of nothing. Necron, the darkness of eternity. After
the destruction of the Crystal Necron appeared. Seeing Kuja trying to kill
himself and anyone else, Necron supposed that all people desired death and was
willing to be the one to bring it. His purpose was exactly that. To bring
everything to the zero world, to create a universe of nothingness. Eventually
Necron lost to Zidane and his party. He was not destroyed. According to his
own words, as long as there is life and death, Necron will always exist.

The Crystal, which contained Necron, is the nexus of all life, the point of
origin of the universe and the only thing that maintains the balance. By
destroying it Kuja believed that everything would seize to exist, instead
Necron came out. The game does not revealed exactly what happened to the
Crystal, it was either destroyed or simply damaged. But given the fact that
the universe managed to survive relatively unharmed, it is safe to say that
the Crystal probably survived the Ultima spell of Kuja.


  #9 - ABOUT THE IIFA TREE AND THE MIST
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Garland's ultimate plan is to turn Gaia into Terra. Terra is an old and dying
planet that has to absorb younger planets to survive, it has absorbed other
planets in the past. But Terra is old, and can't consume other planets
anymore. Because of that Garland had to devise a greater plan. He installed
the Iifa Tree. The Tree's purpose was to filter and disrupt the cycle of
souls. Every planet has a natural cycle of souls. When people die, their soul
eventually returns to the planet and is born again. With the Iifa Tree the
souls don't go back to Gaia, instead they are replaced by the souls of the
people of Terra. In the end, after the cycle is complete and the souls of
everyone in Gaia are replaced, Gaia will become Terra.

The Mist comes as a by-product of this process and is ejected by the roots to
the distant Mist Continent. The Mist is believed to stir the mind and body,
and to spawn evil creatures. The Mist seems to bring out the worst in people
and animals but it also powers all kinds of machinery and vehicles. Kuja also
uses the Mist to create the Black Mages, the magical and lifeless weapons that
he supplies to Queen Brahne. After destroying the Soulcage inside the Iifa
Tree the party manages to stop the refining process of souls and the
production of Mist. This clears all the Mist from the planet's surface but
brought an unfortunate downside of stopping almost every ship on the planet,
except the steam-powered Hilda Gardes of Regent Cid, and most machines. After
the destruction of Terra the Iifa Tree is forced to refine large amounts of
souls from the destroyed Terra and to process them quickly. This causes the
Mist to fill the whole planet.


  #10 - ABOUT THE SUMMONER TRIBE AND THE EIDOLONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The original Summoners' Village was located in the Mist Continent, in
Alexandria. During his first attempt to dominate Gaia, Garland tried to summon
Alexander but failed. That led to the destruction of the village and almost
killed Garland himself. After that, the jewel was divided and scattered. The
remaining summoners then began a journey that ended in the Outer Continent,
where they founded Madain Sari. But at that point, Garland began to fear the
power of the summoners and used the Invincible to wipe out the remaining
members of the tribe. When the story begins, only Garnet and Eiko remain as
the last surviving members of the Summoner Tribe.

A summoner is mainly identified by the horn on its heads. The horn enables
them to speak with the Eidolons and animals so they can learn and train. The
horn does not give them the power to summon an Eidolon. That power is given by
the  different jewels and stones. That is why Garland, Brahne and Kuja are
able to summon Eidolons even though they are not summoners. Garnet had her
horn removed when she was adopted by the King and Queen of Alexandria.

The origin of Eidolons is a mystery even to the Summoner Tribe. They didn't
know if Eidolons were born out of the myths or if the myths were born out of
the Eidolons. But either way, Eidolons are spirits, powerful forces that a
summoner can call in times of need. There are 13 known Eidolons. Most of them
you will be able to use in battle. The process of summoning an Eidolon is
difficult and requires training. If it fails, the consequences can be
devastating. After Garland failed to summon Alexander, the Summoner Tribe
started a tradition of sealing Eidolons they failed to summon, much like
Leviathan was sealed by another Eidolon, Carbuncle.


  #11 - ABOUT ALEXANDER AND THE 4 JEWELS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alexander is probably the most powerful summon known to the people of Gaia. In
his quest to assimilate Gaia, Garland tried to use the power of Alexander to
conquer the land but failed. The result meant the destruction of the original
Summoners' Village. Fearing such power, the summoners broke the jewel in four
and scattered it. One part became the Silver Pendant, National Treasure of
Alexandria. Another part became the Falcon Claw, National Treasure of
Lindblum. The other became the Desert Star, the jewel that protected Creyra by
maintaining the whirlwind around the giant tree. The final jewel became the
Memory Earring of the Summoner Tribe. Together, the jewels can bring forth
Alexander, the holy summon with a power that surpasses even the Dragon King.

Alexander also seems to be very different than the regular summons. He seems
to be the one to call out for a summoner in times of need. The close relation
to Alexandria castle cannot be overlooked. It is impossible to say if
Alexander can be summoned in other places, specially given his size. Seems
that Alexander is the protector of Alexandria, and his powers will only be
revealed if the city is in danger. Also, we can't say what exactly happened to
Alexander after Garland used the Invincible. Common knowledge suggests he was
simply sent back and not killed, much like Alexander defeated Bahamut.
Eidolons will survive as long as the legends that feed their existence remain.


  #12 - ABOUT GAIA AND TERRA
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terra was home of an obviously advanced civilization. But Terra is a dying
planet. Eventually, the people of Terra were forced to go into a deep sleep in
order to survive. To oversee the restoration of Terra they created Garland.
Terra began absorbing planets but by the time the events on Final Fantasy IX
take place Terra is already a very old planet, and it's ability to absorb
other planets is weakening. So Garland was forced to come up with another
plan, he created the Iifa Tree, a device that would stop the natural flow of
souls. He also created the Genomes. As the original souls of Gaia leave the
planet, they are replaced by the ones of Terra. When the exchange is complete,
Gaia will become Terra, the people of the dying planet will awake and the
Genomes will fulfill their purpose by receiving their souls. In the beginning,
Garland tried to take Gaia by force but that plan eventually failed, thus he
created the Angel of Death Project and tried to start an unstoppable war on
Gaia and eventually he succeeded.

The process of assimilation is long, and many years are required for it to be
complete. The purpose of the Angel of Death Project is to speed up the cycle
of souls. When the process is complete, the light of Terra will change from
blue to red and Gaia will become Terra. Terra has always absorbed younger
planets to survive, but the difference between them and Gaia is that Gaia has
life. While absorbing other planets, Terra never gained enough energy to stop
its own decline. But with Gaia, a planet filled with energy and life, it will
be possible to complete the restoration of Terra.

In the end, Kuja reaches Trance and unleashes his ultimate spell and destroys
Garland as well as Terra. The Genomes are transported aboard the Invincible to
the Black Mage Village where they start living alongside the Black Mages,
which once Kuja created as weapons.


  #13 - ABOUT MOGUO
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Many of you keep asking what happens if you piss of Moguo. Well, nothing
happens. I know Moguo might start saying some frightening things like "I'm
sharpening my knife!" and other lines like that, but trust me, it's not going
to do anything to you. He's a moogle, he's furry, he's cute, he's not a
psycho. Stop asking me about this. Seriously.


  #14 - ABOUT MY FINAL FANTASY EXPERIENCE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My party has Zidane (obviously), Steiner (unbeatable strength) Vivi and Eiko.
Zidane is equipped with the Ultima Weapon, a Golden Skullcap, a Bracer, a Dark
Gear and a Protect Ring. Steiner has the Ragnarok, a Grand Helm, the Venetia
Shield, the Tin Armor and a ProMist Ring. Vivi carries the Mace of Zeus, a
Circlet, a Bracer, a Robe of Lords, and a Reflect Ring. Eiko has the Multina
Racket, a Circlet, a Bracer, a Robe of Lords and a Ribbon.

My favorite character is Vivi. He's a sensitive Black Mage and a nice kid and
he has some awesome magical powers, plus his story is pretty sad but has some
heck of an ending. Unfortunately he can't learn Ultima. Sucks.


  #15 - ABOUT THE FAQ AND ON HOW TO CONTACT ME
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I cannot be 100% sure that everything that I state in this guide is true,
specially when it comes to the plot, since everyone has a different theory on
how something could've happened. On the other hand, most things are clearly
stated in the game, or are obvious in terms of context and evolution of the
plotline.

About a walkthrough. I've said it before, I'm not going to make one. It takes
too much time, too much energy, too much patience, none of which I have or
wish to spend on a task like this. There are dozens of FAQs ready to help you
out on that one, this is not one of them. This guide is for those who want to
draw more of their gaming experience, who want to explore every single part of
the game. It's especially for those who have already finished the game at
least once.

As for my email. You're not getting it. I said it before. Don't bother
visiting the sites where this guide is posted. My email is there, but if you
send me an email you're just going to get yourself blocked. I'm retired. There
are many people ready to help, just not me.

This is it for this quest on Gaia and Terra. Final Fantasy was indeed one of
the greatest RPG series for the old Playstation and I had a great time playing
it. My interests have shifted since 2003 when I stopped updating this guide
but I still love games. This will hopefully be the last version of this guide.
There is too much to enjoy...

The revolution will not be webcast.
