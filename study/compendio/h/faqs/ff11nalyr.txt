  1]  Main Menu Commands ______________________________________________________

Anything in the main menus can be accessed through typed commands. Not sure of 
where to find that one menu? Just type in its command instead!

/quest                    Brings up your quest menus.

                          points and territorial information.

                          your current character. This is displayed in your

                          character stays in FFXI, though, so you can still be
                          attacked, etc. if you do not choose a safe area to
                          temporarily log. Anyone searching for you through the
                          search feature will see a blue icon by your name.
                          Anyone who sees your character will notice a circular
                          icon by your name with three blue dots. These icons
                          will disappear once you log back into the game.

  2]  Attacks  ________________________________________________________________

The following commands can be very helpful for macros or just when you are not 
in the mood to get into the various menus and submenus that can sometimes pop 
up in the fray of things.

/attack (/a) [Target]     You will begin to Auto-attack whatever you are
                          currently targeting. If you are targeting an
                          invalid target or no target at all, you will
                          receive an error message. On/Off can also be added
                          before specifying a target to start or end fighting,
                          but it is not necessary.

/attackoff                If you are Auto-attacking something, you will
                          disengage from fighting it.

/autotarget on/off        Toggles auto-targeting for battles. Auto-target
                          will automatically shift your battle target to the
                          next attacking enemy if you are fighting many enemies
                          at once and your current enemy dies.

/lockon [Target]          You will 'Lock On' to the specified target. Your
                          character will follow this target if you have
                          /automove engaged at the time. Typing the command
                          again will take you out of 'Lock On' mode.

/target (/ta)             Targets the closest item, person, enemy, etc. to you.

/targetpc                 Targets the closest player character to you.

/targetnpc                Targets the closest non-player character to you.

/help (/h)                If your enemy turns out to be too much for you to 
                          handle on your own, use this command to call for help
                          from people in the area. You will continue to fight
                          the enemy, but others can join in to help you. No
                          experience can be gained if you call for help.

/assist (/as) [Target]    If someone has called for help in a fight, this will
                          auto-target their enemy for you to help fight it. If
                          you are not in range of the enemy, nothing will
                          happen. You can also use this to target an enemy that
                          a party member has begun to attack.

/item ''[Item]'' [Target] Allows you to use a consumable item in your inventory
                          on yourself.

/equip [Area] ''[Item]''  Allows you to equip an item such as weapons, armor,
                          etc. Not specifying an item unequips the current
                          weapon in that area. Area names are as follows:
                          main     sub      range     ammo
                          head     neck     L.ear     R.ear
                          body     hands    L.ring    R.ring
                          back     waist    legs      feet

/magic (/ma) ''[Spell]'' [Target]     Allows you to cast a magic spell if you
                                      are a mage of any type. The spell name

                                      spelled and capitalized. This can be used
                                      for any spell type including ninjutsu and
                                      songs.

/weaponskill (/ws) ''[Skill]'' [Target]    Allows you to use a weapon skill
                                           provided that you have enough TP and

                                           name must be in double quotes and
                                           properly spelled and capitalized.

/ninjutsu (/nin) ''[Spell]'' [Target] Allows you to cast a Ninjutsu spell if
                                      you are a Ninja. The spell name must be
                                      in double quotes and properly spelled and

                                              provided that you know the

                          for you to fight. If you are checking another player,
                          a screen will come up showing you their equipment,
                          title, level(s) (if not anonymous), their bazaar

                          command also has an on/off subcommand.


  3] Parties, Alliances, and Linkshells _______________________________________

Managing a party or linkshell can be a lot of work. These quick commands should 
help lessen the burden.

---Parties & Alliances---

/partycmd (/pcmd)               The main party command. This has a few
                                special subcommands depending on whether
                                or not you are a party leader:

leave                    Leave current party. (Anyone)
add [Player]             Invites a player to join your party. (Leader only)
kick [Player]            Removes a member from the party. (Leader only)
breakup                  Disbands the party and all members go to solo play.
                                  (Leader only)

/alliancecmd (/acmd)            The main alliance command. Alliance commands
                                can only be used by party leaders.

leave                    Removes your party from the alliance.
add [Party Leader]       Invites a party to join your alliance.
kick [Party Leader]      Removes a party from the alliance.
breakup                  Disbands the alliance and all parties go back to
                                  individual parties.


/invite (/inv)                  Sets your character to seeking a party or
                                playing solo. You can add 'on' or 'off'
                                after the command, but it is not necessary.

/autogroup (/ag)                Sets your character to seeking in auto-group
                                mode. You will be placed in a party
                                automatically with others in auto-group mode
                                who are in the current area.

/join                           Join a party or alliance that you have been
                                invited to.

/decline                        Turn down a party or alliance that you have
                                been invited to.

/nominate (/propose)            Asks a poll. Look at this example to see how
                                it is used:

                                /propose party ''Should we go to Davoi?'' Yes 
No

                                This would show to your party as:

                                [Should we go to Davoi?]
                                1: Yes
                                2: No

                                Spaces are seen as a divider between the
                                question and options, so the question must be 
                                in quotes. A poll can have up to 8 options.
                                Although polls can be said in Say, Shout,
                                Linkshell, and Party modes, it is most often
                                used in parties. To respond to the poll, use 
                                the /vote command. The poll results will be
                                updated as votes come in anonymously. Typing
                                /propose again ends the poll.

/vote [Option #]                Vote if a proposition or nomination has been
                                issued. Votes are anonymous.


---Linkshells---

/makelinkshell (/makeli)           Allows you to make a linkshell if you have
                                   bought a linkshell.

/breaklinkshell (/breakli)         Breaks the linkshell you are using.

/linkshellmes (/lsmes)             Displays your equipped linkshell's server
                                   message. This also has some subcommands:

level [Level]            Sets the authority level allowed to change the
                              message. Levels are: All (any member), LS
                              (linksack members), and PS (perlsack members)
set ''[Message]''        Sets a new message to display.
clear                    Clears the linkshell message of any message.


  4] Mog House ________________________________________________________________

Don't like being social with your Moogle? Then these commands will help you out 
while you are in your Mog House.

/bank                              Bring up your Mog Safe. This also works
                                   outside of the Mog House but you can not
                                   add or take out items.

/storage                           Brings up your Storage menu.

/layout                            Takes you into layout mode for your Mog
                                   House.

/garden                            Takes you into gardening mode for your Mog
                                   House.

/tribune                           Temporarily logs you out of Final Fantasy XI
                                   to read The Vana'diel Tribune newspaper.
                                   This is basically a part of Playonline.


  5] Chatting _________________________________________________________________

There are a variety of ways to express yourself and communicate while in the 
world of Final Fantasy XI. Here are the commands to help you do it:

/say (/s) [Message]             The default talk mode when first turning on
                                FFXI. Can be heard by any character within a
                                short range of where your character is
                                standing. This text is a white color by
                                default.

/shout (/sh) [Message]          A long range talk mode. Can be heard by any
                                character in your current area. This text is a
                                pink or reddish hue by default. 

/tell (/t) [Player] [Message]   A one-on-one talk mode with another player who
                                is online and currently playing Final Fantasy
                                XI. This text is a purple color by default.

/party (/p) [Message]           If you are in a party, you can use this chat
                                mode to communicate with your party members
                                anywhere in the world of Vana'diel. If you are
                                not in a party and use this command, you will
                                receive an error message. This text is a blue
                                color by default.

/linkshell (/l) [Message]       With a linkshell equipped, you can use this
                                command to talk to anyone in your linkshell
                                from anywhere in the world of Vana'diel. If
                                you are not in a linkshell and use this, you
                                will receive an error message. This text is a
                                green color by default.

/emote (/em) [Action]           This command allows you to express actions,
                                similar to a /me command in an IRC environment.
                                The emote message can be seen in the same range
                                as a Say message and its color is purple by
                                default. Unlike special pre-set emotes, these
                                will not be accompanied by your character
                                performing a special action unless you specify
                                one in a macro. (See *Actions and Emotions* for
                                more details)

/chatmode (/cm) [Mode]          This works like the menus in allowing you to
                                set a chat mode as your default to always speak
                                in. Your default chat mode does not require
                                that you put a command in front of every line
                                you type. Shout can never be set as a default
                                mode due to the obvious annoyance factors.
                                Typing just /chatmode will show your current
                                chat mode.

                        [Character Name] looks at <t>, shocked!


---Actions---

For any special emote message with a linked animation, you can have your 
character perform the animation without the text phrase by using this command:

/[Emote Name] motion

For example, if you wanted to have your Tarutaru do the "Happy Taru Dance", 
you'd just type:

/panic motion

If using this command in a macro, you'd use the same command:

/em does the Happy Taru Dance!
/panic motion

The following special emote messages, however, do not have a corresponding 
animation:

/smile             /doze
/slap              /grin
/stare             /dance
/muted

To have just the text appear and not the animation, use this command:

/[Emote Name] text


---Sit Command---

/sit is a newly added command where your character will sit down in a position 
different from that of when you are kneeling or healing. Unlike /heal, you will 
not regain health or magic. While in the sit position, you can perform the 
following emotes:

/yes (/nod)        /cry
/no                /laugh
/clap              /huh
/wave              /farewell
/goodbye 


  7] Friend Lists and Blacklists ______________________________________________

---Friend List---

Want to keep in touch with a party leader after the party disbands? Make a new 
friend while buying something from the Auction House? Keep track of them with 
your friend list!

/friendlist (/flist)               Brings up the friend list menus.

/befriend [Player]                 Asks a person if they would like to join
                                   your friend list.

These commands control how you are seen to people whose friend lists you are 
on:

/online                            Shows you as online.
/away                              Shows you as away.
/busy                              Shows you as busy.
/hide (/invisible)                 Hides your status from your friends.


---Blacklist---

And for those who annoy you to no end, there is the blacklist. By placing 
someone on your blacklist, you will not see anything that person says or emotes 
in any chat form.

/blacklist (/blist)                Brings up your blacklist.

/blist add/delete [Player]         Add or delete a person from your blacklist.


  8] Searches _________________________________________________________________

With over 3,000+ people per server, it quickly becomes a chore to find specific 
people. The search command can help cut those numbers down quickly.

/search (/sea)            The main search command. Just typing this in will
                          show you all the people in your current area.

/sea all                  The 'all' will broaden your search to the entire
                          server.


---Search Terms---

These are used to help narrow down a search and are to be used after the 
/search or /search all terms.

---Search Examples---

The following are a variety of examples of how you can do searches in FFXI.

/search all rank 6                 Searches the world for people of rank 6.
/sea rank 6                        Searches your current area for people of
                                            rank 6.
/sea 6                             Searches your current area for people who
                                            are level 6.

                                            begins with 'Bil'.
/search WAR 28                     Searches your current area for people who
                                            are warriors of level 28.
/sea all race Elv level 4<32       Searches the world for Elvaans that are
                                            levels 4-32.
/sea rank 2 level 10 job whm       Searches your current area for people who
                                            are level 10 white mages of rank
                                            2.
/search region inv                 Searches your current region for people that
                                            are looking for a party.
/sea all -rank                     Searches the world and lists people by their
                                            rank in a descending order.

These are only a few examples, but as you can see, the searches can be quite 
detailed if you want them to be. Capitalization of names and terms isn't always 
necessary and you don't always have to indicate specifically what search type 
you want as long as you are using the proper terms and spellings. You can also 
narrow down your initial search by chooing the top line of the search results 
window and then choosing one of the options on the given side menu.


  9] Miscellaneous Commands ___________________________________________________

Some commands just don't fit into any other specific category...

/?                                 Lists all of the possible commands in FFXI.
                                   By listing a command after /? you can get a
                                   detailed description of the command.
                                   Example: /? /lsmes or /? lsmes

/servmes (/smes)                   Displays the current server message.

/ver                               Displays your version number for FFXI.

/echo [Message]                    Displays a message only you can see.

/random                            Displays a random number of a dice roll to
                                   anyone in the Say range.

/automove                          Toggles auto-movement (auto-run) on and off.

/follow [Target]                   Your character will auto-follow the
                                   specified target as long as it is in range.
                                   This can be turned off by typing /follow
                                   again or manually moving your character with
                                   the controller or keyboard.

/names                             Toggles the names showing above the
                                   characters. You can turn them back on by
                                   typing the command again. This is helpful
                                   for taking pictures.

/anon                              Sets your character as anonymous. Your
                                   job(s) and levels will not be visable to
                                   people who 'Check' you. Your name will show
                                   in general area searches, but your job,
                                   level, rank, hometown, etc information will
                                   not be shown. The name over your head will
                                   also change to a dark blue color.

/wait [Delay Amount]               Mainly for use with macros, this command
                                   allows you to place a delay on performing
                                   actions. The delay can range from 1-20.
                                   Anything higher than 20 is read as zero.

/volunteer (/vol)                  This command is not available to regular
                                   players. It is for voluneteers only.


  10] Targeting Tags and More _________________________________________________

Whether working on an elaborate macro or just too lazy to type in a person's 
name, target tags, also known as pronouns and these other nifty abilities can 
help out a lot with the little things.

<t>                 Selects whatever you are currently targeting.

<st>                Allows you to select a target while you are locked on to
                    another target. This is helpful for healing someone while
                    you are attacking something at the same time. Also known as
                    switch target or sub target.

<lastst>            Targets the last sub target. Useful for macros with 
                    personalized messages.

<stpc>              Sub targets player characters only.

<stnpc>             Sub targets non-player characters only.

<bt>                Targets your party's current enemy that is highlighted in
                    red. If there are multiple enemies being fought, they will
                    be targeted in order.

<ht>                Targets a monster that a person has called for help with.

<p0>-<p5>           Selects a party member. 0 is yourself, the rest from the
                    top of your party list going downwards with <p5> being the
                    last member listed. (In a party of 6)

<a1x>-<a2x>         This is similar to the party pronoun but this is for
                    alliances. a1 is the topmost alliance party, a2 the second
                    party. x is the player to be targeted from top to bottom, 
                    0-5.

<me>                Selects yourself. Just typing in your name works as well
                    for macros targeted on yourself.

<r>                 Targets who you last sent a /tell to. Useful for replying
                    to someone if you don't like typing their name repeatedly.

<pet>               Targets your current pet, wyvern, or avatar.

<scan>              Targets monster tracked by ''Wide Scan''.

<pos>               Lists your current position for your area according to the
                    map grid coordinates. It will be displayed like this: (G-9)

<mpos>              Lists your current position while on the boat.

<call0>-<call21>    Plays a whistle or other sound effect along with a
                    controller vibration (if applicable). Despite the
                    annoyance, these are helpful for alerting party members to
                    danger, starting skill chains, getting the attention of
                    someone who is dozing off or AFK, etc. The call tones only
                    work in party chat. The following is a guide to the call
                    tone sounds:
                    0-3      Whistle Blows
                    4-5      Trumpet Fanfares
                    6-9      Drums
                    10-11    A few bars of the Final Fantasy Prelude tune
                    12-13    Gongs
                    14       Chime
                    15       Buzz
                    16-17    Phone Rings
                    18-19    Boings
                    20-21    Soft Chimes


<scall0>-<scall21>  Plays a whistle or other sound effect but without the
                    controller vibration. These only work in party chat.

<ncall0>-<ncall21>  Only performs the controller vibration. These only work in
                    party chat. If you do not have a vibration enabled
                    controller or do not have vibration turned on, you will 
                    just hear the tone.

                    format. Example: 5BLM
