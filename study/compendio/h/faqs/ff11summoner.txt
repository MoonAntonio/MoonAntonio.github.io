1.0: Introduction
=================

1.1: About the Author
---------------------
I spend nearly all of my time in game with friends on my linkshell. We have 
a web site and screens at http://rinoa.nu/ffxi 

My main job is Black Mage, but I also play Summoner and White Mage to 
advanced levels. The other jobs I enjoy when feeling the need to spank 
something are Monk and Dark Knight.



1.2: How to Use this Guide
--------------------------
While this guide is most useful when read from beginning to end, it may 
otherwise be consulted as a resource in any order. Note, however, that the 
chapters toward the end assume the reader's familiarity with terminology used 
and gameplay. I will not be explaining how to make macros, what AF is, or 
what's a BCNM because that can be found on forums or other guides. 

Also, often the list of abilities and terms here may have been left over 
from earlier versions of the FAQ, made at the time when FFXI was a Japanese 
release only. If you find anything using a confusing term, please say so.

What you won't find in here is copied unconfirmed lists from other sources, 
ascii art, or other fluff. Just about everything described in this FAQ has 
been confirmed because it's been done or worn by the person writing it and
friends.

Although I welcome emails on additions or corrections, personal questions are 
just that, personal. Please don't ask me what to do with your character. 
Whatever you decide to do ingame should be your decision. For questions 
directed to me about this FAQ please use email instead of messaging me in 
the actual game.

The most up to date version of this FAQ can always be found at gamefaqs.com
Please check the version there before emailing me about anything. This FAQ 
is not updated often, however. Although there are changes and additions to 
the game regarding Summoner every now and then, you don't need to email me, 
I most likely knew about it already so please wait for the next version.



1.3: Where to Get More Information
----------------------------------
This guide is designed for middle to advanced-level Final Fantasy XI Players. 
Not for people who have just started. This guide will not contain info on
macros, as macros differ between game clients. Beginners should just check out 
what's found at:

http://www.gamefaqs.com
http://www.ffxionline.com
http://www.playonline.com
http://ffvault.ign.com
http://ffxi.allakhazam.com

I also reviewed the expansions as they came http://flaregamer.com
A site mainly run by all the elvaan sisters on ROD linkshell.



1.4: Summoner Background
------------------------
Summoner is a job that is highly respected in all the Final Fantasy games. 
Being able to use the summons and the strongest ones is often considered a 
final destination. In Final Fantasy XI the summon job created a huge amount 
of chaos when it was first released. Everyone was under the pretense that 
it would be the most powerful job. Little did we know..



1.5: Summoner Job Quest
-----------------------
You must already have another level 30 job to open this job. Opening this job 
only gives you control of Carbuncle.

First, get a [ Carbuncle's Ruby ] RARE EX item by killing leech type monsters.
It's a rare drop and this can take hours with or without a Thief's Treasure 
Hunter abilities.

Locations with leeches:
Zeruhn Mines, Dangruf Wadi, Valkurm Dunes, Ordelle's Caves, Korroloka Tunnel, 
Buburimu Peninsula, Maze of Shakhrami, Jugner Forest, Pashhow Marshlands, 
Rolanberry Fields, Qufim Island, Oztroja Castle, Bostanieu Oubliette, 
Toraimarai Canal, Serpent Grotto, Sanctuary of Zi'tah

Once you have the item, bring it with you to the [ House of the Hero ] at 
Windurst Walls, an event should take place at the door. 

Now you must take the item to 'experience' 7 different weather types in Vana 
d'iel. An event will occur by zone changing into an OPEN area, not a dungeon 
nor a city. Light and Dark weather is not included because you are getting 
the colors of the rainbow. 

Valid locations of getting the weather for this quest:

  [ Fire ]
  Valkurm Dunes, Rolanberry Fields, Meriphataud Mountains, East/West Altepa, 
  Cape Terrigan, Yuhtanga Forest, Yhoator Forest 

  [ Earth ]
  Valkurm Dunes, Konschtat Highlands, Battalia Downs, Tahrongi Canyon, 
  Meriphataud Mountains, Sauromogue Champaign, East/West Altepa 

  [ Thunder ]
  Konschtat Highlands, Jugner Forest, Pashhow Marshlands, Sauromogue Champaign 

  [ Wind ]
  La Theine Plateau, Buburimu Peninsula, Tahrongi Canyon, Cape Terrigan

  [ Water ]
  La Theine Plateau, Jugner Forest, Pashhow Marshlands, Rolanberry Fields, 
  Buburimu Peninsula, Yuhtanga Forest, Yhoator Forest 

  [ Ice ]
  Battalia Downs, Beaucedine Glacier, Xarcabard

  [ Clear Weather ]
  Anywhere with the weather being normal


You may also want to know the weather before travelling to these places. To do 
so you can check NPC weather forecasters at various cities. They will give you 
a general idea for the next few (Vana d'iel) days, for certain areas nearby.

Low Jueno (F-11) Shashan-Mishan

Once you have experienced the 6 weathers listed above, go to (G-6) at La 
Theine Plateau and trade the ruby to the monument there. Now you may open the 
job at your Mog House.



2.0: The Job
============

2.1: Ability List of the Summoner
---------------------------------
A Summoner is not like a Beastmaster. They can only tell their pet to attack
[ Assault ], tell their pet to return to them [ Retreat ], use an ability once 
in a while [ Blood Pact ], and have their pet disappear [ Release ].

Summoned pets can die and be re-summoned, each pet has a recast time, just 
like any magic. Also like magic, Summoner must not be attacked and have enough 
MP to call it and keep going. Hate gained by an Avatar is the same as hate for 
any other pet or party member. It is not completely shared with the Summoner.

When told to attack a monster, the summoned pet will do so until it dies or 
the monster dies, or it is told to stop. Then the summoned pet will go back to 
you, or auto attack any other monster that is attacking you. 

A problem with Retreat is that it has a recast time for using the command, 
yet your pets will most likely auto-attack again if you are attacked, sooner 
than you can use the command again.

If you zone change while the summon pet is still out, it reappear the next 
time you zone change into an area where you can summon.


Astral Flow
```````````
2hour ability, which is a status that lasts 3 minutes long. Can be used from 
level 1 Summoner main and above. Once activated you can access your beast's 
true ability. Elemental Spirits do not have Astral Flows.

How to use:
Have summon out and already attacking monster. If not attacking monster, it 
will miss. Have the ability menu available (this menu is available every 30-60 
seconds depending on what ability you did last), activate Astral Flow and 
choose the last or new option in your pet command menu list. The 2hour for 
each summon has a specific name.

What Happens:
On the first use of the beast's Astral Flow ability, your MP will go to 0. You 
can use the Flow ability about 2 more times if you get enough MP to use it 
again. All MP will again go to 0 on each use, excess MP doesn't affect damage.

MP Drain:
The cost of upkeep for your pet will be paid during Astral. So if you have 
an Element Staff you will actually gain MP by using Astral Flow and doing
nothing while having the pet out. 
Ex: Neptune Staff & Leviathan -> 3MP/sec is gained

Property:
Cost is level x2 MP. If you have no more MP, the summon can/will disappear 
during the charge time of the ability or you cannot select it. Have way more 
than your lvx2 MP so you can get the summon out, get it in position, then 
activate the abilities. 

In fact, this is the whole basis of playing Summoner right now. Have your MP 
ready, take out Summon, get in position, use ability and then make the Summon 
dissapear. The only difference with your 2hour is that the summon will maybe
disappear whether or not you told it to.

You must use the element strong to the element you are fighting, or it can and 
will be resisted. In fact, you should always do this with ALL magic, so 
memorize the order.

Strong -> Weak
Use this element -> on this element
Thunder -> Water -> Fire -> Ice -> Wind -> Earth -> Thunder

[ Level 10 ] MPmax UP
A bonus given to your MP maximum.

[ Level 15 ] Clear Mind
Faster MP regeneration the longer you sit. MP Healing+3 (15)

[ Level 20 ] Resist Slow
Little resistance to 'Slow' status. No use really but primary weapon is a 2h 
staff which is slow to begin with. Slow also affects summon/spell casting, it 
takes 1.5x longer to recast the same spell even after the countdown shows 0.

[ Level 25 ] Auto Refresh
MP recover at all times. 3seconds/1mp.

[ Level 30 ] Clear Mind
Hidden boost. MP Healing+6 (18)

[ Level 30 ] MPmax UP
Hidden boost. A bonus given to your MP maximum.

[ Level 40 ] Resist Slow
Hidden boost. Little resistance to 'Slow' status. 

[ Level 45 ] Clear Mind
Hidden boost. MP Healing+9(21), intervals after that +1(2) more

[ Level 50 ] MPmax UP
Hidden boost. A bonus given to your MP maximum.

[ Level 60 ] Resist Slow
Hidden boost. Little resistance to 'Slow' status. 

[ Level 60 ] Clear Mind
Hidden boost. MP Healing+12(24), intervals after that +1(2) more

[ Level 70 ] MPmax UP
Hidden boost. A bonus given to your MP maximum.

[ Level 70 ] Clear Mind
Hidden boost. MP Healing+12(27), intervals after that +2(3) more


Notes on Status and Damage
``````````````````````````
From tests it seems your own stats and level versus the monster affects summon 
strength. Boosting MP amount and lowering MP costs is most important. INT MND 
CHR doesn't affect summon monster's magic damage. Summoning Magic Skill seems 
to the magic power of your Summon's magic abilities (resist), your Summon's 
accuracy, and Summon's damage resist with physical attacks. It possibly affects
the Summon's defense and evasion, but it is hard to measure.

A less known fact is that CHR increases monster hate on Provoke, so there's no
reason why you should boost CHR. The Austere/Penance equipment set has CHR 
reduction, however I think this is because it simply looks shabby. For that
same reason the wedding dress set (Opaline) has CHR additions.

Since Summoners more often than not need to play "back up healer", carrying
a set of Enmity minus equipment is helpful in critical situations.

All summon monsters have a huge range for damage amount (as in you can do 6 
damage or 1000) based on your level and the monster you are fighting. 
Important note is that there is NO DAMAGE CAP in the damage equation for 
Summoned Avatars. Your damage potential will grow as you level up, along with 
the amount of HP your Avatars have.


09/14/2004 Modifications
````````````````````````
-Avatars can now participate in skillchains and magic bursts by carefully 
 timing the use of the ability "Blood Pact." Astral Flows also can be 
 timed to magic burst.
-The damage and accuracy of several avatar attacks have been adjusted.
-Avatar TP will now enhance the potency of magical Blood Pact abilities. 
 Just as with normal player TP, after the ability the avatar's TP will be 
 reset to zero. Avatar TP does not affect physical Blood Pact techniques, 
 and thus TP will not be lost after an avatar uses one of these abilities.
-Avatar TP is gained like player TP. Dealing and recieving damage, including
 magic damage. It is lost after any magic ability.
-Using avatar abilities without TP results in the normal strength.


MP Drain Rate
`````````````
Depending on your level and the summon used, your MP will be drained whenever 
the summon is out. It also costs MP to actually summon. The cost of drain 
has been modified in July 2004. The MP is drained every 3 seconds.

Calculating Drain:
Carbuncle initial cost is 1, every 9 levels +1
Spirits initial cost is 2, every 4.5 levels +1
Fenrir initial cost is 1, every 7.3 levels +1
Avatars (before level 62) initial cost is 3, every 9.3 levels +1 
Avatars (after level 62) initial cost is 3, every 3 levels +1


The general drain rate difference (not including auto refresh):

MP drain at level 1~ for Avatars is about 3mp/3seconds
MP drain for Spirits at level 1~ is 2mp/3seconds
MP drain for Carbuncle at 1~ is 1mp/3seconds
MP drain for Fenrir at 1~ is 1mp/3seconds

MP drain at level 30~ for Avatars is about 6mp/3seconds
MP drain for Spirits at level 30~ is 8mp/3seconds
MP drain for Carbuncle at 30~ is 4mp/3seconds
MP drain for Fenrir at 30~ is 5mp/3seconds

MP drain at level 60~ for Avatars is about 9mp/3seconds
MP drain for Spirits at level 60~ is 15mp/3seconds
MP drain for Carbuncle at 60~ is 7mp/3seconds
MP drain for Fenrir at 60~ is 9mp/3seconds


Summoner Job Skills
```````````````````
Dagger          (Skill Rank E, not good to use as Summoner)
1h Club         (Skill Rank C+, not very good either)
2h Staff        (Skill Rank B their best weapon, more proficient than WHM 
                 with it, but still weak)
Evasion         (Skill Rank E, just like all other back line magicians)
Summoning Magic (Skill Rank A-, only SMN job can level up this skill)

I suggest leveling up your weapons and evasion by some other job, as SMN will 
not be able to in party. To level up Summon Magic skill, simply summon and 
make your pet disappear repeatedly. The day of week, moon and weather 
supposedly helps. However, by my observation it seems completely random and
you are limited to getting about 1.0 skill up within a real time hour.


Status Ranks
````````````
Race, Job and Sub Job combined affect your final stats. 
These are the rankings of the Summon Job, possible sub and Races.

2.2: Acquiring Elemental Spirit Summons
---------------------------------------
These summons have no ability menu and will cast magic of their element at 
random. You can use them starting at level one (as with all summons) if you 
'eat' a Scroll, much like other magic. They cost more MP to summon and drain 
more than the Avatars & Carbuncle. However the calling time is much more 
faster. They also can cast ancient magic on the enemy, but it's very slow. 
Most people simply use these for skill up.

Air Spirit     - Dropped by SMN type Yagudo in Oztroja Castle, Sauromogue 
                 Champaign
Ice Spirit     - Dropped by SMN type Demons in Castle Zvhal Baileys
Fire Spirit    - Dropped in level 40 or 50 BCNM battles
Water Spirit   - Dropped by SMN type Tonberries in Temple of Uggalepih
Light Spirit   - Dropped by NM Tonberry in Temple of Uggalepih, BCNM30(God 
                 coin), BCNM50 (Comet Orb @ Palborough)
Dark Spirit    - Dropped by NM Demon in Castle Zvhal Baileys
Earth Spirit   - Bought from shop at Norg
Thunder Spirit - Dropped by BC20 (Comet Orb @ Ghelsba)



2.3: Aquiring Avatar Summons
----------------------------
(Zilart Expansion Required)
In order to accept the quests for each Avatar you need to have fame in the 
city which is offering it. This is not the same fame as finishing one-time 
quests. It involves fame from doing repeatable quests as well. You must do 
one-time quests of a location and many repeatables in order to accept the 
Summon Avatar quest. There are 9 Ranks of fame levels, to know if you are 
Rank 9, the NPC mentions "the Goddess". Rank 9 isn't required for the Avatar 
quests, though. Also, all party members must have accepted the quest and 
have the Tuning Fork in order to enter the battle. 

Warning: You can only clear each Avatar quest once a (realtime) day.

Fenrir Notes:
To accept Fenrir's quest you must have all previous summons defeated and
the key Whisper item from defeating them (do not return to their offering 
NPC). When speaking to Leepe-Hoppe you will recieve the key item to enter 
Full Moon Fountain BC.

*You do not necessarily need to have all previous Avatars either. 
Say you are a melee who only wants Fenrir items, you can defeat the previous 
Avatars and keep the key Whisper item without ever having recieved the 
ability to Summon those Avatars.


Getting to the Cloister Areas
`````````````````````````````
Use the maps found at Lonely Vana d'iel for how: 
http://www58.tok2.com/home/lonelyff/

This is the type of MGS needed to get through without battling:
Kuftal Tunnels (to get to Terrigan) - Sneak
Cape Terrigan - Sneak and Invisible
Quicksand Caves - Sneak
Boyahda Tree - Sneak
Temple of Uggalepih (to get to Rancor) - Invisible
*Entering Rancor requires a party member with the Paintbrush
Den of Rancor - Sneak and Invisible
Ifrit's Cauldron - Silent Oils and Prism Powders (magic sensitive)
Fei Yin - Sneak, Sneak and Invisible at basement level (some magic sensitive)
Toraimarai Canal - Sneak


Recommended Battle Strategy
```````````````````````````
When you reach the Cloister, cast all prepatory spells, eat foods, etc. 
Once everyone is ready, members in the party then click onto the Protocrystal 
and enter a BCNM, a short cut scene will happen to everyone until they are 
able to move around inside. You then must defeat the 'Prime' Avatar.

In this BCNM only 6 party members are allowed, it can be escaped by exiting 
through the Protocrystal. One party can be in there at a time, and if everyone 
is dead, they will be removed automatically from the BCNM after the time 
limit. The time limit is 30 minutes.

For each battle I suggest this lineup:

If party is level 60+
PLD/WAR or NIN/WAR (damage tank)
RDM/BLM or RDM/WHM (can stay at front line and recast Ba-Spells, Refresh)
WHM/BLM or WHM/SMN (main cure tank, recast Ba-Spells at rear line)
BLM/WHM (main attacker and support healing)
BLM/WHM (main attacker and support healing)
BRD/WHM (main job is keep Carol up)

If the party is level 70+, any (common sense) strategy will work. Keep in mind 
that anything can happen, and sometimes the Flow will still do full damage.

The point is for keeping up the Ba-Spells, MP and Carol up. Only Magic strong 
to the Avatar will damage it, therefore the 2 BLM make defeating it quick and 
painless.

At around 50% HP, the Avatar will use its 2hour ability. Depending on whether 
Ba and Carol has been up, it can either obliterate your front line of the 
party or you will survive. Recently the Ba-Spell equation power has been 
changed, making Prime Avatar battles much easier. Before, Ba-Spells will give 
you +20 resistance to that element. Now the Strengthen Magic Skill level could 
boost Ba-Spells to around +90 at level 70. All Avatars are similar, except 
Shiva which casts SleepGa - so have everyone eating "poison status" items in 
order to stay awake.

Upon defeating the Avatar, another cut scene will occur and everyone will 
automatically leave the Protocrystal battle field. After this, you will get 
a "Whisper" key item. By going back to the Quest offer NPC you get either: 
ability to use the Avatar, RaEx equipment, RaEx items or 10,000 gil.

Fenrir is an exception, it is 10 levels stronger than the others, and has an 
ability which removes all enhancing magic, including foods. There is no Ba
spell for Dark defense either, but there is a Carol.


Mini Quest Strategy
```````````````````
An optional quest allows Summoners to get the avatars other than Fenrir solo. 
Talk to the NPC near the respective taru and you will recieve a mini fork. 
The Summoner is warped to the Cloister and fights the battle solo with 
Carbuncle and a cap of level 20, only. Without Carbuncle Mittens (something 
needing high level) I doubt many actual low leveled Summoners would do this 
just to get the Avatar. It also turns out that in a later patch, a dezone 
scroll was added, so you can use it to go back to homepoint.

The only strategy I can think of is use Carbuncle's Astral Flow and chuck 
Ethers, Hi-Ethers and Pro-Ethers while having Yagudo Drinks.

[ Notes from Players who tried ]
-Do all buffs and heal MP to full before entering
-The beasts have sense magic, so if you summon near them, they will aggro
-Summon Carbuncle from just the right distance, and have it attack
-If Carbuncle dies, beast name becomes yellow and beast regens it's HP
-Resummon ASAP and it will automatically attack beast to stop regen
-Continue until enemy HP is less than 50%, then use Shearing Light
-Use Ethers and resume attacking beast/resummoning Carbuncle
-When Astral Flow is available use Shearing again
-If the Avatar is not yet dead, repeat the first steps with Carbuncle



2.4: Optional Avatar Item List
------------------------------
*The plus and minus for elements mean resistance
*Conserve MP is a BLM passive ability which randomly lessens the cost of 
 magic spells during cast
*Spirit Magic Skill is only for BLM, DRK and RDM
*Each Avatar now has an optional quest item, explained under Evoker Ring

2.5: Ability List of the Summons
--------------------------------
At level 1 all Avatars (including Carbuncle) have an Astral Flow ability. 
These are all wide range attacks! Keep that in mind when using them, as 
it will aggro monsters in a crowded area. The astral flow can be resisted
if your skill is low, and it also can miss if the monster moves.

Notes on Spirit Avatars
```````````````````````
Each of them get spells at the same level that a WHM or BLM main would. So 
if your SMN job is 50, the Light Spirit gains Holy, if your SMN job is 
50, the Ice Spirit gains Freeze. The spell used is random. At level 75 they 
cast a spell for every 200 MP drained, with AF2 pants it's every 100 MP. 
To have them cast spells sooner, wear the wrong staff for faster MP drain, 
such as Dark Staff for Light Spirit.



2.6 Skillchain and Magic Burst
------------------------------
Added on the 09/14/2004 update were new properties to summon abilities. 
The more TP a pet has, the more potent magic abilities become.

For more information on skillchain possibilities, try the calculator 
found at http://ffxi.xenoveritas.org/tools/skillchains
or the chart found at http://www.geocities.jp/ffxi_smn/chain.html

3.0: Advanced Information
=========================

3.1: Job Properties and Subjobs 
-------------------------------
This is all my opinion after playing more than 70 levels of the job. However, 
I lead just about all my parties, allowing myself the freedom to avoid 
becoming a brainless curetank. I was able to cast and use abilities at my own 
discretion. That included experimenting.

Currently the SMN job is highly flawed. There are also many bugs involving 
all summons. People would still see a summon onscreen although you recalled 
them. If someone unequips an item or moves while you do a party strengthen 
ability, you loose the MP, the summon will freeze, the summon wont even do the 
ability. The timer will reset and say "you can't do anything for another 
minute". This also happens if you and/or your pet fell asleep or became 
stunned as you commanded it, the timer resets and nothing happens. Really 
frustrating and can mean life or death for your party.

The same thing happens if the monster died just after you activated the 
command while your pet had been targeting the monster previously. Your pet 
will freeze, the timer resets, MP is gone but nothing has happened. Also, 
attempting to use an ability just before the MP you have for that ability 
is gone, will result in a frozen pet along with no command window. 

Another bug involving lag has the summon pet out, you have no commands at all 
in the pet menu nor can you use macros. The only way out of it is to 
reconnect, or to let your MP drop to 0 so the pet disappears. 

As well, if a monster moves as your summon does any ability (astral flow, 
magic, ranged attacks included) it too will get the "out of range, this 
ability could not go" message. Your MP is lost, nothing happens and your 
ability menu is gone, too. 

Auto attack also is a problem. If the Summoner is attacked, the summoned pet 
will automatically engage and attack the enemy. This is problematic as you can 
tell your pet to 'dissapear' or 'come back' only once every few seconds. In a 
BCNM or multiple enemy battle where monsters are continually put to sleep, the 
summoned pet often wakes up an enemy by attacking it before you have the time 
to make it stop. Another reason why the pet should not be left 'out'.

A SMN is simply a messy cure tank and defense boost all the way. The only known 
uses for this job are at level 70. Used mainly as defense in HNM and BCNM 
battles. Even then, other jobs are preferred. Their offensive attacks are 
nowhere near as strong and reliable as BLM magic or RNG damage, this is 
offset by the fact that the damage dealt is 'safe'.

There is also little skill or active thinking involved in playing as Summoner. 
One can do an ability then go AFK to get coffee while their MP regens. Little 
timing is required outside of attempting to magicburst, which often isn't 
as useful as the other ability commands available.

Which brought me to the question, what is my role as a Summoner? Maybe this 
is what makes Summoner versatile. Although you have the pact ability once 
every minute, you have to make sure you make the most out of it. That 
includes recasting party effects only when necessary, or making sure that 
your pet is safe from attacks such as Sleep or Paralyse if you are moving 
into battle position. Depending on each monster or situation you are put into, 
try to keep in mind the status of your party members, their locations, monster
AI and TP (determine what it may do next) and what is the most productive pact 
ability to use at that exact moment.


Party Forming
`````````````
The ideal rear guard (the 3 mages in a party) for a Summoner past level 40 
involves having a RDM and a BRD. Certain monsters will require a WHM for 
status recovery spells and such, however.

Why no WHM? Well, you and the WHM will be curing, overlapping and confused. 
There's nobody Magic Bursting or adding to the kind of damage only magic 
can do. This simply makes battles take too long.

Why RDM? RDM can help cure, help MB and at later levels refresh everyone, 
then convert and keep going at the same pace as SMN's MP which can also keep 
going for a long time. Dispel is extremely important at high levels and 
Gravity is a useful weaken spell which also lowers monster evade.

Why no BLM? Two people taking really long to get MP back is just the worst 
possible situation. Both have spells/abilities costing lots of MP. Unless 
the BLM is "an attacker" of the party (that is, doing no cure at all and 
pure magic offense) chances are you don't need one. I have had SMN BLM BLM 
NIN BRD RDM parties, and although they were awesome it's rare to find all 
the jobs necessary and if they were found, chances are the party needs a 
bilingual leader.

Why BRD? Why not? By this time in the game you will have noticed how powerful 
a Bard can make your party. Bards can also adapt to the monsters weaknesses, 
sleep linked monsters (Sleepel does not work on undead but Lullaby does) and 
do other things than simply sing Ballad for you.

Even with Ballad1, Ballad2, Refresh, Autorefresh, Staff & Mittens piled up, 
having your summon out during battle is still completely wasteful. After all 
that complicated party forming, I still did not feel like an actual Summoner 
who could leave their pet out for the duration of the battle.


Support Job
```````````
For the current level cap, the best subjob is WHM and no other. Also, the only 
job useful with SMN as a subjob for practical purposes is WHM Lv50~. People 
wonder if they can have two pets by subbing DRG or BST, but it will not work 
as you will get the "you already have a pet" error.

Why WHM subjob:

1. Cure bad statuses, RDM sub cannot cure statuses
2. 2h staff skills which are available only to WHM/PLD/MNK when main or sub
3. Party spells you can use without significant loss in power or effectiveness
4. Can teleport at very high level.

What SMN/RDM gets:

1. If skill maxed beforehand, useless dagger skills
2. Slight increase in cure cast speed since its the only thing you can use. 
   Summons cannot have their "speed up" by RDM sub, nor would they need to be.
3. Less MP more HP (ick)
4. Offensive spells you will never use since the power, spells and skill is 
   half of your level.
5. People believe a SMN can convert and refresh in the future cap levels. 
   Turns out level 75 is the last cap rise (Refresh and Convert impossible).

Summoners don't use their weapons in battle normally due to lack of skill, STR 
and DEX. They belong in the traditional "back row". So RDM's Enchant is useless 
when you miss and won't do damage, it's equally useless on Ramuh's party 
enthunder ability. Summoner also has the weakest defense out of all jobs (even 
less than BLM) and HP, so they should never be near a monster.


Why cure tanking is so bad
``````````````````````````
SMN job does not include "Recovery Magic Skill". The skill is only as good as 
your subjob's and then it is halved. Your cures do not do much, so in turn you 
cure even more than a WHM or RDM do, generating hate and dangerous problems. To 
boost your cure power you would need a special staff of some kind.

Even AF does not have hate minus for summoner, it has hate minus for the 
summoned pet! Avatar hate is the same for any party member hate. It is 
separate. When you call back your Avatar, the hate generated to it is gone as 
though that Avatar member 'died'. Same for if the Avatar actually died. It 
does not affect your hate or other party members hate.

It makes no sense because we want our summons to take hits. Summons can be hit 
by statuses and cannot be fixed aside from being recalled/died and called out 
again. Sleep however is another story. If you fall asleep from certain spells
or boss/monster weaponskills your summon can fall asleep too. When you wake 
up, your summon should wake up at the same moment.



3.2: Playing by Level
---------------------
This is more of my old forum posts from back when I was playing. Chances are 
your leader would request otherwise.

1-10: Use your summons as purely attackers
10-24: Attacker and occasionally ver2 magic/abilities
24: Play with the barely useful Carbuncle pro/shell
25+: Garuda party Blink, most used ability for a long while
28: Shiva Icespike, para is barely effective and it's just for show
31: Ramuh's Enthunder, lasts even shorter than Ice Spike but fun
36: Garuda's cure, not even useful since you will already have CureGa, which 
    is faster and less mp.
38: Ifrit Warcry before renkei but for the MP it costs why bother?
40: Shiva SleepGa, I'm expecting this to be for BCNM40 
    Sleepga does not work well on totetote++ when linked while leveling
42: Ramuh Shockspike, feels the same as IceSpike, for show
44: Carbuncle's "random status up by 10" fun but the stats go back down too 
    soon anyway
46: Titan (after 40 levels of not using him) has party Stoneskin
    There is a cut on the max amount of damage you can take, it is weaker 
    than 'real' Stoneskin.
47: Leviathan (after 20 levels of ignoring) has party Cure/Esuna
48: Garuda (after all that Blink) has HasteGa, cut down in the amount of time 
    it lasts. By this time only 1 or 2 party members ever need haste anyway.

After this summoner gets nothing new that's really of use until 70. People 
will rotate between Blink, Stoneskin, Hastega and rarely using Leviathan's 
cure/esuna (which is a very slow ability).

50: Shiva's Double Slap, in case you already haven't noticed that Shiva is so 
    weak physically, this can do lots of damage if she hits BOTH times.
55: Carbuncle's petit meteo, slightly weaker than the version 4 magics
60: Version4 spells, instead of using party strengthening only, using version4
    to finish off monster becomes your main goal. BRD's threnody is required 
    for it to not be resisted on strong enemies. Your damage can vary to above 
    the cap, depending on level. 
70: The summon's new physical attacks are the best damage you can do. Great on 
    tote or weaker leveled monsters. Will easily miss on totetote++, HNM, boss 
    type, and monsters which have defense against physical attacks.

Summoners with Fenrir should take care when using the Dispel type ability, 
as it is an area effect. The accuracy and evade modifying abilities are the 
main use for Fenrir. Make sure to note the moon phase before using it.

Fenrir's Eclipse Bite seems nearly as strong as the level 70 attacks but not 
quite so. The thing to look for when choosing which 70 attack to use is the 
type versus that monster. For example, Garuda's predator claw seems to be 
strong on skeletons, but Leviathan is strong on monsters with high evade. 

70 ability damage from Highest to Lowest:
Garuda, Leviathan, Titan, Ifrit, Ramuh, Shiva


Ability Range and Positioning
`````````````````````````````
Take time to figure out how to make your Summoned pets appear in the spot
you want when you call them. Also know the range of your pets abilities,
both offensive and defensive, as they are very small. Learning to eyeball
it comes with plenty of practice and use.

Eventually you will be in situations where your character cannot be near 
the melee, but needs to use the Summoned pet defense abilities on them. 
By positioning yourself (with pet out) then finding the perfect spot 
where you are safe and the melee are in range of the ability, you can
resummon a pet and it will appear where you last had it. This saves time 
from repositioning or waiting for the pet to get in range. Time saving
is extremely important as you can only use your pact once a minute.


Blink, Stoneskin and Healing
````````````````````````````
Blink is so important because not only do monsters miss attacks, their magic 
can miss too, until it wears off. This means way less healing. As for the 
party healing abilities, since it takes time to get the summon out and in 
position, the inability to use this job for reacting to instant situations 
makes it all the more flawed and MP costly.

Only give your party Stoneskin if many targets are getting it, and their 
Skin has completely worn off. Also be sure to give people using Ninja job (as 
main or sub) the Stoneskin instead of Blink.


Lunar Cry, Ecliptic Growl and Ecliptic Howl
```````````````````````````````````````````
The pattern and amount of stat boosts is rather unclear naturally, depending
on the moon phase decide whether to boost your frontline or your rearline. 
Until anyone can figure out the english equivalents of the Moon Phases, I 
will have to leave this chart as is. The phases are different in the 
Japanese client, while the English client has percentage values.
STR stat boosts go to STR, DEX, VIT
INT stat boosts go to AGI, INT, MND, CHR

Moon Phase           Lunar Cry            Ecliptic Growl     Ecliptic Howl

How to Fish Monsters with your Pet
``````````````````````````````````
Something extremely useful for SMN or people with SMN subjob. When leveling in 
an area where monsters link, or it's too dangerous for a fighter to go fish, 
you can use pet to get a monster. 

If you make your pet disappear too soon, the monster may give up. This is why 
you either need to let the pet take/give a few beatings and build more hate 
towards your party.

Example A (No Link Monster):
Monster is in an area filled with Ghosts. Summon Carbuncle, cast Sneak on 
yourself, go to the monster, make Carbuncle attack it, then run back to camp 
spot. Your Sneak will not be cancelled. Either call back Carbuncle or let it 
die to the monster. The monster will automatically come to your party. Places 
needing Invisible will not work. Telling your pet to do things cancels 
Invisible status.

Example B (Link Monster):
There are 4 Spiders you want to fight near each other and will link. Make your 
pet attack one until it dies. Do not panic when the other 3 spiders attack it. 
When your pet dies, the other 3 spiders will stop while the originally 
attacked monster will come to your party. If a spider pops on the way back, it 
will link. So be sure that all the monsters which may link are grouped 
together when you let the pet die.

Warning:
Using offensive SMN abilities will cause you to loose your Sneak.



3.3: Items, Equipment and Weaponskills
--------------------------------------
What to eat as a Summoner
`````````````````````````
There's only two cheap things you really need. Chocolate and Juice. Bubble 
Chocos are easy to make or buy in dozens, and they increase your "while 
sitting MP recovering rate". High quality of the Bubble Choco is the Heart 
Choco.

The other thing you need is lots and lots of juice if there is no RDM in the 
party. It's easy to make Pine Juices using 2x Kazham Pines + Water crystal. 
Since juice cannot be stacked, carry the pines in dozens and crystals in 
dozens with you to the party.

Many Summoners love to "raise" their MP by eating pies, which I find 
wasteful because the power of a Summoner only is seen once a minute. The rest 
of the time is spent sitting and healing MP. The more MP you get sitting, the 
better.

Stats of useful foods for SMN: 
Bubble Choco    - sitting MP recover+1 (30m)
Heart Choco     - sitting MP recover+4 (60m)
Mushroom Kabob  - MP+10 STR-1 MND+3 sitting MP recover+2 (30m)
Witch Kabob     - MP+15 MND+4 sitting MP recover+3 (60m)
Pamama Tart     - MP+10 HP+10 DEX-1 sitting MP recover+2 (60m)
Sweet Rice Cake - MP+17 VIT+2 INT+3 MND+1 sitting MP&HP recover+2 (30m)

Wizard Cookie   - sitting MP recover+7 (5m)
Ginger Cookie   - sitting MP recover+5 (3m)
Coin Cookie     - sitting MP recover+6 (5m)
Cinna-Cookie    - sitting MP recover+4 (3m)
Choco Drink     - sitting MP recover+3 (3hr)

Apple Juice     - 1MP/3sec (120s)
Orange Juice    - 1MP/3sec (90s)
Grape Juice     - 2MP/3sec (90s)
Tomato Juice    - 1MP/3sec (180s)
Pine Juice      - 1MP/3sec (240s)
Melon Juice     - 2MP/3sec (135s)


What to wear as a Summoner
``````````````````````````
Most people stick to all MP boosting equip possible. Aside from that, RSE 
equipment (if MP boosting) will do great until the level for AF equipment, but 
will be very low defense.

Your main weapon should be a staff with an MP boosting quality to it or a 
MP cost down quality to it. When fighting something solo, use a Pole type of 
weapon. They have stronger attack, no MP boosting and look like they are 
wrapped with white at the middle.

SMN job can wear shields, but like BLM they have no skill whatsoever. Their 
subjob's shield skill is applied.

Another thing, cloaks with "Refresh" added to them will work with your "Auto 
Refresh". So yes, you will get the refresh from your equipment item, combined 
with your job's refresh. Instead of 1MP/3sec, it will become 2MP/3sec.

There are also throw items, which boost MP such as Morion Tathlum and Phantom 
Tathlum. Recently there was an MP Egg from Easter, don't throw them!

items. Trade them to Mamaurabin in Norg, you can trade each item one at a 
time so they don't fill your inventory. Each of the item names are 
related to previous FF games. After waiting JPN 0:00 next day, talk to 
him to receive your ring.


[ Level 50 RareEx JSE ]

Nimbus Doublet: Def26 Regen Light Spirit MPcost-1 Lv50~ WHM/SMN
You get these by doing Brygid's quest in Bastok Markets. An Aries Subligar

the Nimbus Doublet. Subligars are RareEx level 50, dropped by Fomors in
Sacrarium or Phomiuna Aqueducts.


Summon Cost Reduction 2h Staff List
```````````````````````````````````
Keep in mind that if you are Summoning something which is the element weak 
to the staff you are wearing, a hidden MP cost is added. Also if casting 
spells weak to the element of the staff you are wearing, their strength is 
lowered. Magic strength is only that of the caster, and not of your pets at 
all. Don't expect your pets to do more damage physically or magically, the 
"attribute magic" boosts only affect yourself.

Examples: 
Wear Fire Staff and cast Blizzard, your damage is lowered
Wear Light Staff and summon Fenrir, MP cost becomes +2
Wear Aquilo Staff and summon Garuda, MP cost becomes +3

[ Gate of Tartarus ]
WS "Gate of Tartarus" can only be used by a level 75 SMN or BLM. When 
the WS is used, it has an additional effect of attack down, while the 
effect is active the SMN or BLM recieves a Refresh status. The WS is 
gotten by upgrading the Relic 2h Staff multiple times. At full upgrade 
the staff becomes:

Claustrum lv75~

3.4: Rare Ex Armors
-------------------
I did Artifact Armor quests in a mad rush when it was first released, so I 
barely remember details. AF1 requires you to be lv40~ summoner, AF2 
requires you to be lv50~. All the BCNM battles have NO limit in party 
members, you can have an alliance inside! The key item can be reused as 
many times until you are successful, the key item can either be kept in mog 
or discarded anytime (like any other BCNM orb). One key item can unlock the 
BCNM for multiple people on the quest and in the same party/alliance (one 
battle is enough for all). You can throw away the key item (RaEx pendulum) 
after winning each battle.

3.5: Modifications to Summoner Job 
----------------------------------
Square-Enix changed quite a few things to Summoner Job but it still is never 
enough. So far they have increased the Astral Flow damage and lowered the cost 
of only two abilities. The one major change occured when they lowered the cost 
of summoning Avatars (Shiva, Ifrit, etc) from 30MP to 7MP, yet raised the cost 
of summoning Elemental Spirits. Fenrir however is 15MP. They've also added 
renkei (skillchain) and MB (magic burst) for certain Avatar abilities.


Future Beast Ability List
`````````````````````````
These are used by the "Prime" summons and are not usable by players yet. 
They're magic damage, hopefully Shiva and Ramuh's are strong, to even out 
their weak physical specials.

Ifrit: Meteo Strike
Titan: Geo Crash (additional affect: Stun)
Garuda: Wind Blade
Ramuh: Thunder Storm
Shiva: Heaven Strike
Leviathan: Grand Fall


What Summoners want (from 2ch BBS, Summoner's Dream)
````````````````````````````````````````````````````
-Skill up to become easier, right now it is wasteful to try to do
-MP costs change (if a less people get a party ability, then less mp cost)
-2h staff skill rank A
-Faster summoning and ability menu use
-Summon's attacks having enchant already
-Keeping summons out having less mp slip (or none at all)
-The damage summons do is valid for the MP cost, so it does not feel wasteful
-Auto Refresh 2 at level 50 (2mp/3sec)
-Teleport or Escape ability
-More traditional FF Summons (Odin, Siren, Bahamut, etc)


What I want
```````````
-Toggle on/off for pet's auto attack
-Modify /wait settings for macros so that we can use other macros too
-Pet abilities have better descriptions and the boost values visible
-Some sort of party saving ability involving crowd control
-Increase range of party abilities to the same as protect and shell
-Fix bugs with player movement and equip change, it cancels abilities
-See where your pet is on the map
-Know what statuses (positive and negative) are on your pet
-Know when your pet's weakening on monsters has worn off, such as Tail Whip



3.6: Random Observations
------------------------
These are various notes that came after 75 levels of playing in parties, 
HNM battles, Missions or farming/hunting as SMN. You can see what my 
equip is like somewhat: http://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?17975

Maximizing your Power
`````````````````````
Merit points should be put into MP and Summon Magic Skill so you can be 
more powerful all around. The merit status boosts also will work in level
capped areas such as those for Missions. 

Take time to learn about monster weaknesses the way a Black Mage would,
it will help you in selecting correct Blood Pacts and Astral Flows to 
use on monsters. I saw a 50 damage Tidal Wave Astral Flow coming from a 
75 Summoner who had full AF2, maxed skills and Astral Signa. The player
didn't pay attention to the fact that a HNM had magic defense. Magic 
based Blood Pacts are still magic and can be resisted.


For people who hate waiting for parties
```````````````````````````````````````
Use the time to go just outside of town and level up your Summon Magic skill. 
I've done this only once or twice while waiting for people. You can make a 
macro so that you can study while leveling it up or do other things. This 
skill is impossible to level up normally in party. It is naturally low.

Summoners are able to also solo various monsters decently at level 71+. If 
you're feeling risky you can even solo for exp almost like a BST in Tu'lia, 
but expect some long downtimes and close calls.


Indispensible Summoner Stuff
````````````````````````````
-Dark/Pluto Staff
Ever since the Elemental Ore staves were introduced, Dark Staff is the most 
important piece of equipment you can get. The amount of time a SMN spends 
sitting must be shortened as much as possible. On that same note, anyone 
above level 72 should invest in the Errant Houppelande shirt for an extra 
5MP when Healing and macro the standing/sitting equipment.

-Light/Apollo Staff
With Light Staff you get the needed power to your Cure Magic and the needed
MP cost reduction to keep Carbuncle out at levels 51+.

-Spirit Taker WS
Russta reminded me about this WS, the damage you do is returned in a 1:1 
ratio for MP. You can do a blood pact then get all the MP back by doing this 
WS on a monster which doesn't have high defense or evade.

-Carbuncle Mittens
At low levels you can even solo with these. They're valuable help in low 
level BCNMs, and an MP cost saver when using your pet to fish monsters.
With these you can have Carbuncle following to keep you safe in dungeons.

-Evoker Ring
With these you get a large equip boost in Summon Magic Skill and an MP boost 
without loosing HP (something SMN needs). The MP cost reduction makes it 
possible for Carbuncle drain no MP at level 71+ when combined with Carbuncle 
Mittens and Light Staff.

-SMN AF1 Pants
These pants give your pet the needed aim to land their physical hits and 
physical attacks with far greater accuracy than normal. Highly important 
at levels 70+.

-SMN AF1 Boots
If using your pet to tank a monster or monsters, these give your pet a 
visible boost in evasion so they can stay up longer.

-Anything that Boosts Summon Magic Skill
If you are playing by using your pets offensively, the most important thing 
to boost aside from the obvious is anything which boosts your skill. If you 
played the job like most normal players, your skill is most likely behind 
by many levels. AF, Evoker Ring, Summoner Torque are the easiest boosts.


Hate and Pet Behaviours
```````````````````````
Doing anything builds hate towards your character, but how much and 
under what conditions? I did some experimenting:

-When pets automatically Assault monsters
If a monster faces you, before it even attempts to hit you, your pet will 
automatically engage with the monster. The pet AI will recognize the 
monster AI targetting you.

-Telling Pet to Assault before engaged with monster
Always do this at a neglible distance from any monster, being too close may 
have the monster turn to you for a second. Allow your pet to take/do a few 
hits so that hate is built towards the pet. Telling Pet to Assault does 
create a small amount of hate from the monster towards yourself.

-Telling Pet to Retreat when engaged with monster
This builds a little more hate towards you, and will drag the monster and 
whatever links with it towards you (and not your pet). Monsters which were 
hit by your pet (built hate) will only target your pet. Other monsters 
which were linked on the way will target you until hate is built towards 
them by someone or something else.

-Using Blood Pact before engaged with monster
Using an offensive Blood Pact is considered an act of agression towards a 
monster. Therefore a little hate will go towards you, even before your 
pet has done the attack. If your pet has landed the attack, hate will go to 
your pet. If your pet did not land it, hate will still be towards you.

-Pets may give up
If you tell a pet to attack something and the monster moves further away,
you may have to repeat the command as the pet will go back to you instead.

-Ability/Macro lag
The time between your button press and the action being sent and appearing on 
your screen is delayed by about one second. So you can hit your macro about 
one second before you are able to do an ability and it will execute on time.
