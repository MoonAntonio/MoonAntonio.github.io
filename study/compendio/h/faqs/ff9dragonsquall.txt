 Part 1 - About the Enemy
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Finding the Island
------------------
There's only one place to challenge the Yans. Vile Island is to the 
South-West of the Iifa Tree. To make things more annoying there's 
only two ways to get on it - both of them by air. 

The easier of the two methods is to play the game until you get 
control of Garland's/Kuja's Airship the Invincible. You gain 
command of this airship at the start of disc four.

The second way is a Flying Chocobo. Play Chocobo Hot and Cold,
collect and dig up enough chocographs for Choco to evolve into a 
golden chocobo. You won't be able to collect enough Chocograph 
Pieces for Choco the evolve until you have control of Regent 
Cid's airship The Hilda Garde 3. 

You'd be mistaken for thinking you can land the Hilda Garde 3 here. 
The Hilda Garde can only land on grassy areas which Vile Island does 
not have.

Island Treasures
----------------
I'm not covering this in detail since this is mainly side quest 
stuff and other FAQ's such as Yee Seng Fu's Side Quest FAQ cover 
these in depth.

If you've gotten a gold chocobo you'll be able to find Chocograph 
number 23 (Fairy Island) here. 
 This treasure chest contains: 33 x Potions
                               15 x Annoyntment
                                1 x Holy Mitre
                                1 x Dark Matter Card

In the forest on Vile Island you'll encounter a special kind of Yan.
He'll ask you if you've met his friends before running away. If 
you've met his eight friends around the world and met their demands
the special Yan will stop running away and ask for a Diamond. If 
you give him this he will give you 50 AP and a Rosetta Ring for 
your troubles.

Meet Your Foe
-------------
Below is information about the Yan
Level:     72           EXP:    42,672
HP:    19,465           AP:          2
MP:     3,378           Gil:     4,436

Status Immunities: Berserk, Silence

Attacks:       Comet, Virus Powder, Float, Aera, Snort
Weak Against:  Shadow
Items Stolen:  Ore, Elixer
Items Won:     Hi-Potion, Phoenix Down
Blue Magic Learned:   Auto-Life

What makes it so tough?
-----------------------
First of all his attacks. Although it rarely uses Aera magic all 
other moves are quite common. He pummels you with Comet almost 
every turn usually causing heavy damage to a single team member. 
(Usually anywhere between 1000 and the full 9999 damage). When he's 
not using Comet he'll probably be using Virus Powder, which damages 
for about 2000HP and inflicts the Virus status (In my opinion this 
is a helper. I'll discuss this later). In addition to doing big 
attacks he has high speed. Sometimes he can do two or three 
attacks in a row. 

But what makes him toughest by far is his counter-attack. Unless 
the attacked Yan is under the influence of sleep status ANY 
attack on him whatsoever (even if it misses) will immediately 
follow with his Float magic or the dangerous Snort attack. This 
counter will literally Snort the attacker out of the battle. The 
character snorted will not gain any battle EXP/AP similar to the
Virus status. Losing any member from battle is bad because it 
leaves the remaining fighters to take up all the damaging attacks 
dished out by the Yans.

What makes it worth it?
-----------------------
Why put yourself in this sort of punishment? 
ANSWER: EXP and Elixers. 

A single Yan doesn't offer the most EXP per defeat (The Chimera 
offers more). But unlike Chimera's which only appear singley, Yans 
can appear in groups of twos and threes as well.
 SO that's 3 x 42,672 = 128,016 EXP!!!
And that's without the Level Up Ability on!
This amount of EXP makes it easy to level up to the maximum Lv99.

Also, the only other way to get Elixers other than treasure chests 
and winning them from bosses is to steal elixers off the Yans.

Overall Suggestions
-------------------
By the time you have reached Vile Island you should have learned at 
least half of all your abilities and be around about level 50 (If 
not, you better if you want to stand a chance against them.)

Since no-one has unlimited magic stones for equipping you have to 
ration out abilites. Remember, choosing abilities is totally up to 
you and the following are only sugguestions. The following 
abilities are highly recommended.

*Auto-Life
*Auto-Regen
*Auto-Potion
*HP +10%/HP +20%
*Gamble Defence

These three are recommended but not nescessary.

*Auto-Haste
*Antibody (I know this Guards against Poison/Venom but I also 
     believe this reduces chances of the Virus status but I 
     don't know for sure.)
*Insomniac (See Quinas Battle Strategy to see why)

Individual Character Sugguestions
=================================
Since everyone has a slightly different variety in abilities here's 
some sugguestions for individual character abilites.

Zidane Tribal

Mug, Bandit, Master Thief, Counter, Eye 4 Eye, Protect Girls, 
High Tide.

----------------------
Half MP, Boost, Concentrate, Chemist.

Vivi Ornitier
-------------
Half MP, Return Magic

Adelbert Steiner
----------------
Chemist, Cover, Counter, Eye 4 Eye, Alert.

Eiko Carol
----------

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Part 3 - Battle Strategies
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Battle Overview
---------------
If you're around the Lv50 mentioned earlier each character should 
have at least 2500HP or more. This should be enough to survive 
Virus Powder. Damage caused by Comet seems very random (usually 
1000+ damage). Cross your fingers and be prepared to heal.

Yans have the advantage if ANY team member is KO'ed. Revived 
characters have low HP they will die again if the Yan decides to 
attack them. Don't wait for Auto-Regen to heal them, have someone 
heal characters who are critically injured as soon as possible.

If you're manually healing your party avoid using Potions unless 
the character has the Chemist ability. Healing 150HP is nice but 
it just doesn't hack it against two attacks of about 1000-3000HP 
each. Use healing magics or Hi-Potions to restore HP.

When battling Yans, concentrate on a single Yan. Attacking all 
three at once results in three seperate counter-attacks. A real 
time-waster.

Don't bother trying to drain the Yan's MP. He has too much and even 
if he did run out of MP he still has Snort and Virus Powder.

Instant death attacks are very handy in these battles. But be aware 
that if you miss, (which is quite often for death attacks) there's 
a fair chance that you'll be snorted away.

If you're going to use special attacks go for maximum damage. Two 
hits of 9999 will kill him.

Above all be prepared to lose at least one character from the 
battle. By dying or removal from battle it doesn't matter. 

Individual Character Strategies
===============================
Each character has their own set of commands and so also need their 
own set of strategies. Below are tips for fighting the Yans for 
each individual character.

Zidane Tribal
-------------
The hero of the game will be in every single battle with the Yans 
(Since you cannot switch the leader). This is a bit of a downer 
since Zidane's range of attacks are a bit poor.

If you plan to use Zidane to steal items from the Yans have the 
Mug ability equipped - If you're going to be thrown out of battle 
for stealing might as well hurt him some. 

If you plan to use him as an attacker power up Zidane's Thievery 
attack by using the Steal command lots (Each successful steal 
increases thievery damage by 14~15HP). After stealing hundreds of 
times Thievery will eventually reach the full 9999HP damage.

Princess Garnet/Dagger
----------------------
Dagger can be used as either a healer or an attacker. Dagger has 
the Chemist ability which doubles the effects of Potions, Ethers 
and Hi-Potions. Use this ability to top up the teams HP/MP.

Don't bother using Daggers status attack magics. They tend to miss 
and Yans have immunity to Silence. And Berserk.

Using summons with the boost ability equipped is useful for 
characters with the Auto-Regen ability equipped. The summon 
animation will give some time for Regen to recover lost HP. Take 
note that this will probably get her snorted so use this at your 
own risk.

Odin can instantly dispatch Yans (provided the attack hits) but 
will probably be snorted by remaining Yans. Learn Odin from the 
Dark Matter item bought from the Treno Auction house.

If you have 70-80 Amethyst and are at a reasonably descent level, 
Atomos with the boost ability can do 9999 to all. Using this as a 
first blow will set other characters up for a single 9999 hit 
kill.

Alternately have Dagger summon Ark since Yans are weak against 
shadow elemental attacks. There are two ways to obtain Ark: defeat 
optional boss Ozma or refine two pumice pieces in Memoria at the 
Legendary Synthesis Shop in disc four.

Vivi Ornitier
-------------
Vivi should mainly be used as support in Yan battles since Yans 
have high resistance to magic. More often than not, Vivi will die 
if he is hit by Comet. This is consistent with most mages with 
their high magic but low defense. 

The return magic ability will allow Vivi to counter-attack all 
Comet attacks thrown at him provided he doesn't die from their 
initial attack. However like the Yans Comet attacks, the damage 
from Vivi's comet seems pretty random.

If you plan to attack using Vivi cast the shadow elemental magic 
Doomsday. Note that this can SERIOUSLY hurt your whole team too 
so equip Shadow elemental defense items. Learn Doomsday from the 
Mace of Zeus in Memoria (disc four).

If you haven't reached disc four yet Vivi should Focus a few times 
before using his strongest magics such as Flare and Bio. Don't try 
using Meteor - I've never seen it hit. 

If you want to try a quick one-hit-kill use Vivi's Death magic. 
Learn this from the Black Hood.

Adelbert Steiner
----------------
Steiner should be used as a full-on attacker. However, Steiner is 
one of the few characters who has Chemist so you may want to use 
him to top up characters with Hi-Potion/Ethers.

Avoid using his Power/Armor/Magic/Mental Break attacks. These miss 
quite often and you can't afford to lose him just for reducing the 
Yans defenses.

Use Steiners strongest attacks such as Shock, Climhazzard and 
Stock Break. 

Exploit the Yans shadow weakness by using Steiners Darkside attack. 
This attack costs HP instead of MP so heal after using it.

Iai Strike can kill Yans instantly if the move hits.

If Vivi's also in the attacking party use Steiners strongest sword
magic attacks such as Flare and Doomsday.

Eiko Carol
----------
Eiko should primarily be used as a healer in these battles.

Try to keep Eiko in this battle. There's a faint chance that 
Phoenix will resurrect a fallen team.

Similar to Dagger, the animation time of the summons will allow 
characters with Auto-Regen to recover lost HP. Remember that 
you'll need boost equipped to see a full summon animation.

Cast Full Life to KO'd characters the moment they've fallen. This 
costs quite a bit of MP but use this anyway. You need to worry 
more about HP than MP. Learn this magic from the Siren's Flute 
or a Light Robe. 

If more than one person is KO'd in the battle cast Phoenix. It'll 
hurt the Yans while resurrecting fallen characters. You'll probably 
lose Eiko but in my opinion it's probably worth it.

Freya Crescent
--------------
Freya has the Chemist ability. Use this to top up HP/MP levels when 
they are getting low.

The more dragons the party kills, the more damage Dragon's Crest 
inflicts. About 60 dragons killed will do 9999 damage. 

If you're feeling EXTREMELY lucky use Six Dragons. The outcome 
each time you cast is not very predictable. 

A more interesting way is to Trance Freya and make her jump. When 
Freya uses Spear the Yans will counter attack other party members 
until there are none remaining. When the other members are dead 
Yans will be unable to counter attack until Freya's Trance ends, 
but by then Freya should have killed them.

Quina Quen
----------
Quina is perhaps one of the most helpful characters in these 
battles because he has a good variety of healing and attacking 
Blue Magic moves.

Cast Auto-Life on characters who do not already have this ability 
equipped and be prepared to use this the moment someone has been 
revived to increase their chances of survival. Surprise, surprise! 
You learn Auto-Life by eating Yans!

*NEW *If your whole team has the Insomniac Ability equipped make 
Quina cast Night. The Yans WILL be inflicted by the sleep status 
for a short time. During this time use magics or one-hit-kill 
techniques to hurt them. Don't use physical attacks as this will 
wake them up allowing the Yans to counter.

Don't bother using Bad Breath. It rarely hits and Yans have 
immunity against most bad statuses.

If you're feeling lucky try out Doom and Mustard Bomb. You'll 
learn Doom by eating Veterans in Memoria or Ipsens castle AND 
you'll learn Mustard Bomb from most enemies in Mount Gulug.

If Doom hits he'll waste 3-5 seconds of the Death timer 
counter-attacking leaving him less time to live. 

Mustard Bomb is much more better. If he gets the Burn status, he 
automatically dies for counter-attacking  :P

If the party is protected against the sleep status cast Night. 
This puts anyone in the battle to sleep unless guarded against 
it. Yans will fall asleep leaving others to finish them off.

Other notable mentions are Frog Drop, Lv3 Def-less, Lv4 Holy, 
Mighty Guard, White Wind and 1,000 Needles.

Amarant Coral
-------------
Chakra is a useful healing move as it also restores MP.

Like Vivi, the Return Magic ability will allow Amarant to throw 
back any Comets thrown at him.  

Similar to Quina's Doom attack, Countdown will put a timer for 
Death to occur and the Yans waste some time counter-attacking. 

If you wish to use special attacks go for the No Mercy attack.

Full Team Strategies (NEW!)
===========================
This section was added so that you, the reader can submit your 
own strategies against the Yans. Submitted strategies will be 
cut and pasted into here so watch your grammar.

Sent in by Pedro Cruz <spiralpegasus@bol.com.br>
Have Quina in your party, make him cast night (protect your party 
from sleep 'cause this afflicts them as well), them Summon Odin, 
it'll kill two or luckily tree of them. The one that rest kill 
with Vivi Death magic since it's sleeping. Or Steiner Iai Strike.

 Part 4 - Miscellaneous

Putting the Virus to good use
-----------------------------
Remember that 128,016EXP? That's how much EXP will be split between 
your team so they get 32,000 each. But if a single character got 
that amount of EXP in one go it pretty much guarantees a level up a 
battle until about Lv75. 

Yans occasionally uses Virus Powder, inflicting the Virus status.
This stops the character from gaining any EXP/AP until the status 
has been cleared with the Vaccine item.

Have all but one character inflicted with the Virus status. Make 
sure that this person will stay alive to reap in the EXP at the 
battle end. Because the other characters will probably be killed 
anyway have them keep the non-virus'd character alive while also 
attacking the Yans.

Oh yeah, remember the Level Up ability? Equipping that on the 
character will increase the EXP gained by a factor of about 1.5 (I 
calculated this myself). So the more EXP gained in one turn, the 
more bonus EXP you get.

Another point. Once you've reached Lv99 you'll still split EXP with 
other team members. Virus a Lv99 person so that they stop getting 
EXP they don't need.

Yan EXP Chart
-------------
Alright before you check these charts take note that
  THESE ARE NOT PERFECT
They are not 100% accurate and should be used as a rough guide to 
show much EXP you get.

OK. Here's a rundown of the columns
# of Yans - How many Yans you defeated in the battle
# of Survivors - The number of characters which survived the battle 
                 without being KO'd, Virus'd or Snorted
EXP per Survivor - How much EXP surviving each character will get 
                   from the battle
Level Up Ability Bonus - EXP added on top of 'EXP per Survivor' if 
                   the Level Up ability is equipped
Total EXP received per Survivor - How much EXP you'll get after the 
        battle with the Level Up ability equipped. Basically it's 
        the two previous columns added together 

/------------------------------------------------------------------\
