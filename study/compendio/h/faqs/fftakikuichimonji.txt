3. Blue Mage Abilities
-----------------------

To master an ability on a Blue Mage, with the exception of Learning, Immunity,
Damage > MP, and Blue Combo, you need to encounter with an enemy with that 
ability (It can be a monster or a Blue Mage) and it must be used on the Blue 
Mage when Learning is equipped as the support spell. The Beastmaster class
helps a lot with learning these abilities, since you can force an animal to 
use an Ability on your Blue Mage with Control. Some abilities such as White
Wind or Dragon Force can only be obtained with Control.
