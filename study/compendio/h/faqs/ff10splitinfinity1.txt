IV) PHRASE SEARCH ENGINE
=============================================================================
=============================================================================

Q1 - What is this? Why would I even need it?
A1 - With the guide at current state it becomes difficult to find what you're
looking for. This inspired me to create this phrase search engine (PSE).

Q2 - Okay, sounds good. What am I going to find in it?
A2 - What you will find here is an alphabetical list of every item, magic,
enemy etc. etc.

Q3 - Nothing special. I can make one of my own, if I wish...
A3 - What will be so special about this alphabetical list, you ask? Let me tell
you then. Each entry shall be given a specific code number.

Q4 - How is that going to help me jump straight to what I need?
A4 - Let's say you'd need a strategy to help defeat 'Optional boss'. So you
look into this list... you look up 'Optional boss' which would appear like
this:
...
Optional Boss - XBOSS
...
Take note of code number at the end. Now press CTRL + F at same time. In the
pup-up window type in XBOSS and press Enter twice to be taken to what you're
looking for. No hassle whatsoever. Speed satisfaction is guaranteed.

Q5 - There are few phrases which mean different things...?
A5 - No problem there. Such phrases will be marked by special code in
parenthesis. Find what it is here.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BB - Blitz tech          | C - Celestial wpn upgr. | SS - Special Sphere
KI - Key item            | WM - White magic        | I - Item
S - Status               | OS - Overdrive skill    | F - Fiend
S1 - Special command     | S2 - Skill command      |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q6 - Why are some phrases shortened to one letter only...?
A6 - By throwing a quick view in the list, you may notice that some names are
abbreviated. That's because these names are spoilers. The only way for these
entries to be included was like this.

Q7 - I can't find the thing I'm looking for in this part of the guide. Where is
it?
A7 - In the second part of the guide, found here:

V) ABOUT CHARACTERS
=============================================================================
=============================================================================

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TIDUS          | AGE: 17  | JOINS: He's present from the beginning
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BACKGROUND     | Star player of the Zanarkand Abes, a famous team known
throughout Zanarkand, is heading for the play that will decide the victor.
During blitzball match, a mysterious force known as Sin destroys Zanarkand. In
the chaos that ensues after the attack Tidus is swallowed up many years into
the future... far away from Zanarkand he once knew. Torn up from everything and
everybody he unwillingly sets foot on a pilgrimage throughout Spira as one of
Yuna's guardians. During the trip he develops feelings for Yuna (but we already
knew he would, right?:)). But there's one other thing on Tidus' mind: hatred
for Jecht, his father.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIGHTING STYLE | His main advantage is high dexterity, therefore making him an
excellent choice for disposing of fast and agile enemies. However, he has
trouble hitting flying enemies. For being bent on speed domination Tidus
employs a variety of agility enhancing techniques, such as Haste and Hastega.
As a countermeasure he uses Slow and delay techs to disallow fast enemies to
even get a turn in. He is first character capable of fighting underwater.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
OVERDRIVE      | His overdrive is called Swordplay. Once selected, try to stop
the marker in highlighted area of the bar for additional damage. New overdrives
are learned thru repeated use of existing overdrives.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
YUNA           | AGE: 17  | JOINS: Besaid island, after leaving Besaid vil.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BACKGROUND     | Daughter of high summoner Braska, the last summoner who was
able to defeat Sin 10 years ago. She has just recently became fully-fledged
summoner after her prayers have been anwered at Besaid temple and she was
entrusted with first aeon. Yuna has decided long ago that she will follow in
her father's footsteps and become the next summoner, who will bring the Calm to
Spira. For that to happen she must journey to many temples and pray to fayth
inside each temple in order to obtain Final Aeon, the only means of destroying
Sin.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIGHTING STYLE | Yuna is one of the weakest characters on the battlefield, when
it comes to taking physical damage (she makes up for lack of defence with high
starting evasion). Her magical prowess is high, however. She can aid the party
well with waste array of her white magic spells, most important being Esuna,
Holy, Auto-Life, Protect, Shell and Reflect (there's many more spells, tho').
Her other strength lays in aeons - she's the only one who can summon. Is there
a particularly strong enemy in your way that just won't go down? Call in Yuna
and let the fiend have a taste of what it feels like to be outmatched.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
OVERDRIVE      | Her overdrive is called Grand Summon. When used, the aeon
called enters the fray with full overdrive gauge. Once aeon uses the overdrive,
overdrive gauge returns to previous level.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
LULU           | AGE: 22  | JOINS: Besaid island, after leaving Besaid vil.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BACKGROUND     | One of Yuna's guardians. She considers Yuna like a younger
sister, which needs to be protected. After Yuna becomes fully-fledged summoner,
Lulu decides that she will protect her on the journey, no matter the costs.
This is Lulu's third pilgrimage so far and since the third is usually the
best... Lulu is calm and always seems to be in control of the situation.
However, under the fierce outside appearance a gentle and compassionate heart
beats.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIGHTING STYLE | Much like Yuna, Lulu is also pretty weak when it comes to
taking physical damage (her starting evasion is even higher than that of Yuna).
She's fairly tough when it comes to taking heavy brunts of magic attacks. Her
main specialty is black magic, the most important being Demi, Flare, Ultima and
Death (there's many more). She is the fear of flan-type and element-type
elements, for she can dispose of those using only one of many elemental spells
she can learn.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
OVERDRIVE      | Her overdrive is called Fury. When selected, rotate the right
stick as fast as you can. New Furies are available once Lulu learns respective
spell.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
RIKKU          | AGE: 15  | JOINS: Moonflow - North bank
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BACKGROUND     | A young Al Bhed girl, equivalent of FF7's Yuffie and FF8's
Selphie, this cheerful individual will surely keep you in the good mood. There
seems to be a certain relationship between her and Yuna... what it is about,
I'll let you find out for yourself when playing the game.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIGHTING STYLE | Another character that falls easily to physical attacks. She
makes up for it with superior starting speed. Where she does come in useful are
her special abilities, with which she can steal from enemies (stealing from
most robot-type enemies will destroy those instantly), attack enemies using
excessive gil or even bribe enemies and receive rare items in exchange. She is
second character capable of fighting underwater.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
OVERDRIVE      | Her overdrive is called Mix. By combining two items from your
inventory she can conjure up one of 64 ending results ranging from healing to
attack.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
WAKKA          | AGE: 22  | JOINS: Besaid beach
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BACKGROUND     | Captain of Besaid Aurochs, an unsuccessful blitz team, who is
yearning for victory, even if just one. Wakka is easily recognizable with his
trademark hairstyle. He introduces Tidus to the rest of the gang after Tidus
washes up at the beach of Besaid. After this year's blitz tournament Wakka will
retire and devote his time to be full-time guardian. Will he really...?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIGHTING STYLE | Armed with a strange weapon, blitzball, he can take on flying
enemies and enemies with high evasion. Thanks for this goes to his superior
starting accuracy. Other field Wakka's good at are his skills, with which he
can put enemies to sleep, silence or darkness them. He is third and final
character capable of fighting underwater.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
OVERDRIVE      | His overdrive is called Slots. When activated, fruit machine
with three reels will spin. Depending on the symbols shown a variety of attacks
can be launched. More overdrives are available by winning blitz games.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
AURON          | AGE: 35  | JOINS: Luca, during blitz tourney
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BACKGROUND     | Former guardian of Braska, Auron helped defeat Sin ten years
ago. Now he joins forces with Yuna and other guardians to put a stop to Sin's
terror once and for all. Rather than words he lets his huge sword do the
talking. But there's something about Auron which just doesn't seem to be
right... how the heck does he know so much about Sin? This and many other
questions will be answered late in the game.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIGHTING STYLE | A powerful melee fighter, Auron is primary choice for dealing
with tough enemies, especially those who are armored. He is also known for his
Break abilities, which cut down on enemy's attack and defence. Two downsides,
low agility and weak magic defence make him susceptible to taking many hits
(augmented by high HP).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
OVERDRIVE      | His overdrive is called Bushido. When activated, enter the
commands in given time limit to enable additional damage or effects. New
overdrives are learned by collecting Jecht spheres.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
KIMAHRI        | AGE: 25  | JOINS: S.S. Liki
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BACKGROUND     | Member of the Ronso tribe, proud race of warriors who inhabit
Gagazet mountain, Kimahri has watched over Yuna since she was small child. Like
Auron, he doesn't speak much, instead focuses only on his job as the guardian.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIGHTING STYLE | Another strong close combat expert, tearing thru armored
enemies like they weren't even there. Fails to hit flying and agile enemies,
though... in addition he's also somewhat slow and prone to magic damage.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
OVERDRIVE      | His overdrive is called Ronso Rage. When selected, choose one
of enemy skills and use it against the enemies themselves. New Ronso Rages are
learned by using Lancet on respective enemies.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

12. Doom counter:    Some monsters / bosses have no immunity or resistance to

                     before being KO-ed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
14. Element prop:    Information on boss' / monster's element affinities,

                     defeating a certain monster
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT NOTE: IF YOU SEE A PART OF THE CHART NOT PRESENT, THAT MEANS THAT
MONSTER / BOSS IN QUESTION DON'T PRESENT OR DON'T HAVE THAT PARTICULAR PART!
Example 1: Most bosses are immune to Doom, so I'll be omitting DCOUNT part for
such bosses.
Example 2: Most bosses are immune to Bribe, so BR part will not be included.
Example 3: Many regular enemies have no statuses they resist with certain %, so
making STRESIS entry is not necessary.

STRATEGY | An interesting battle. It's comprised of five 'slots'...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you look at the chart with a deep-eye, you'll see few parts missing. As
already said, this doesn't mean I forgot about them - IT MEANS THAT BOSS /
MONSTER IN QUESTION DOESN'T OFFER THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF INFO.
Let's examine what's not mentioned:
1. Bribe part is missing. Reason? You don't get anything for Bribing Chocobo
Eater, as it is immune to Bribe.
2. DCOUNT part is missing. Reason? If you look at STIMM part, you'll see DOO
among the crowd - boss is immune to Doom, so no need to make DCOUNT part.
3. In element section only ELEMWEAK is present, others are missing. Reason?
Chocobo Eater's only elemental affinity is fire - it's vulnerable to fire.
Other four elements needn't be mentioned, as boss takes normal damage from
those elements.

VII) BASIC CONTROLS
=============================================================================
=============================================================================

BASIC CONTROL EXPLANATIONS

I'll get you started by explaining what are the controls you'll be using when
playing the game. There are four distinctive control modes you'll have to get
used to. These are battle screen controls (inside random or boss battle), field
screen controls (when walking about), menu screen controls (when inside many
menus, accessible with triangle button; when shopping) and lastly Sphere Grid
controls. May be hard for a start, but you'll get a grasp of it in ten minutes.

I - BATTLE SCREEN CONTROLS
Up/down dir.b.     - move cursor
Left analog stick  - move cursor, change between command sets
Left/right dir.b.  - change between command sets

VIII) WHAT'S SPHERE GRID? ---> A836
=============================================================================
=============================================================================

Q1 - What is Sphere Grid?
A1 - Sphere Grid is what I would call an advancement system of sorts. If you
haven't noticed already, there is no EXP or chrs' levels in FFX. Instead you
get to use Sphere Grid, a rather big board with lots of circles, called nodes.
These nodes are filled with all kind of stuff... black magic, white magic,
special abilities etcetera. You are required to move across this grid,
activating the nodes as you pass them in order to raise your characters.

Q2 - Raise my characters? I'm not their mother!
A2 - Bad wording.:P Anyway, by raising I mean raising chr's statistics, such as
HP and Strength. Fighting alone will bring you nowhere, as it doesn't increase
stats. You have to use Sphere Grid (SG from now on) in order to increase chr's
stats to be able to defeat enemies late in the game.

Q3 - So how do I that?
A3 - You may have noticed something called S. Level (SLV from now on). This
stands for Sphere Level. By having your chrs participate in a battle and
defeating fiends any character that made at least one action in that battle
(even if just defending for one turn) will gain AP (Ability points). Once you
gain enough AP for certain chr's SLV to increase by say one level, that
character can now move ahead or back on SG. By ahead I mean moving over SG on
nodes character hasn't yet activated or been to, and by back I mean moving on
nodes character has already activated or been to.

Q4 - My SLV increased by five levels. Now what do I do?
A4 - You have two options. Most common decision is to move forward, in which
case the cost will be 1 SLV per one new node. In case you decide to move back,
cost is 1 SLV for up to four old nodes. So in your case you'd be able to move 5
nodes forward, 20 nodes back or 12 nodes back, then 2 nodes forward. Remember,
once you move on SG, that's it! SLV used for the process are lost for good.

Q5 - I see a node that has something in it. What is that for?
A5 - There's 16 different kinds of nodes you're able to find on SG.

a) Empty node                   - wanna guess?
b) Node with letter H           - once activated, raises chr's HP
c) Node with letter M           - once activated, raises chr's MP
d) Node with sword              - once activated, raises chr's Str
e) Node with shield             - once activated, raises chr's Def
f) Node with encircled triangle - once activated, raises chr's Mag
g) Node with shielded triangle  - once activated, raises chr's Mdef
h) Node with arrow (points left)- once activated, raises chr's Agi
i) Node with star               - once activated, raises chr's Luck
j) Node with 'yin-yang' symbol  - once activated, raises chr's Eva
k) Node with bulls-eye          - once activated, raises chr's Acc
l) Node with letter 'X'         - once activated, chr can use this Skill
m) Node with encircled +        - once activated, chr can use this Special
n) Node with white square       - once activated, chr can use this Wht Magic
o) Node with black square       - once activated, chr can use this Blk Magic
p) Node with L.* sign           - this is a Lock node and prevents chrs from
                                  advancing past this node; it can be removed
                                  with appropriate Lv.* Key Sphere
Note: * represents numbers 1, 2, 3 or 4

Q6 - Activate nodes? How do I do that?
A6 - There's two requirements in order for a chr to activate a node. First, chr
must be on or adjacent to the node you want to activate and second, you'll need
spheres. Lots of them. All of such spheres and what they do is listed below:
- POWER SPHERE     - activates Strength, Defence and HP nodes
- MANA SPHERE      - activates Magic, Magic Defence and MP nodes
- SPEED SPHERE     - activates Agility, Accuracy and Evasion nodes
- ABILITY SPHERE   - activates Skill, Special, Wht Magic and Blk Magic nodes
- FORTUNE SPHERE   - activates Luck nodes
- ATTRIBUTE SPHERE - activates attribute node already activated by ally
- SPECIAL SPHERE   - activates Special node already activated by ally
- SKILL SPHERE     - activates Skill node already activated by ally
- WHT MAGIC SPHERE - activates White Magic node already activated by ally
- BLK MAGIC SPHERE - activates Black Magic node already activated by ally
- MASTER SPHERE    - activates any node
- LV.1 KEY SPHERE  - removes Lv.1 Lock
- LV.2 KEY SPHERE  - removes Lv.2 Lock
- LV.3 KEY SPHERE  - removes Lv.3 Lock
- LV.4 KEY SPHERE  - removes Lv.4 Lock
- HP SPHERE        - turns empty node into HP+300 node
- MP SPHERE        - turns empty node into MP+40 node
- STRENGTH SPHERE  - turns empty node into Str+4 node
- DEFENCE SPHERE   - turns empty node into Def+4 node
- MAGIC SPHERE     - turns empty node into Mag+4 node
- MAGIC DEF SPHERE - turns empty node into Mdef+4 node
- AGILITY SPHERE   - turns empty node into Agi+4 node
- EVASION SPHERE   - turns empty node into Eva+4 node
- ACCURACY SPHERE  - turns empty node into Acc+4 node
- LUCK SPHERE      - turns empty node into Luck+4 node
- CLEAR SPHERE     - removes nodes from SG**
- RETURN SPHERE    - returns to any previously activated node by current chr
- FRIEND SPHERE    - teleports to any ally's location
- TELEPORT SPHERE  - teleports to any activated node
- WARP SPHERE      - teleports to any node
Note: ** Clear Spheres cannot erase Ability, White Magic, Black Magic, Skill
and lock nodes.

Q7 - OK, I get activation and that... btw, what are those small spots I see
around every node on SG?
A7 - These are used to quickly tell which chr has already activated which node.
There are 7 spots, differently colored and representing one of each of playable
chrs. Once certain chr has activated a certain node, that chr's spot around
activated node will light up. This is a useful feature for quick reference
without having to switch thru all chrs to see which chr has activated which
node. Also, when chr is selected, you will see a colored line after or before
that chr. Use this to see what path that chr has already walked on in order to
avoid wasting SLV for trips over paths you've already been to.
- LIGHT BLUE color belongs to Tidus
- WHITE color belongs to Yuna
- PURPLE color belongs to Lulu
- GREEN color belongs to Rikku
- RED color belongs to Auron
- DARK BLUE color belongs to Kimahri
- YELLOW color belongs to Wakka

Q8 - I need advice on choosing the SG I would like to use during the game.
A8 - If FFX is your very first FF or you're playing it for the first time, I
highly suggest you choose Standard Sphere Grid. However, if you have already
finished the game once, or are feeling daring enough to undertake the challenge
of Expert Sphere Grid, be my guest. Expertize as you see fit. What is very good
about Expert SG is that all chrs start very close, therefore if you want to
have a party consisting of black mages only, this isn't a problem. The bad side
is that you need to plan ahead on what path you'd like to take.

Q9 - What are all those empty nodes for? I doubt they're there just for an eye-
candy...
A9 - *eats a candy* Nope. They're to be used late in the game, when you have
access to Monster Arena. By defeating monsters there you can gain possession of
special spheres that can be used to fill empty nodes. For example, by defeating
Ironclad you'll get HP Sphere, which you can use anywhere on SG (as long as
it's used on an empty node) in order to raise your HP by 300. The same applies
for all other 9 statistics.

Q10 - There's a lot of crappy +1 nodes on SG. And all spheres I use on empty
nodes morph into +4 nodes, so I wanna get rid of all +3 and lesser nodes.
A10 - Your help awaits in Monster Arena again. By unlocking Ultima Buster in
Monster Arena you'll be able to buy Clear Spheres, which is used to remove any
node (except Ability nodes) from SG permanently. Beware - if you remove say
Str+3 node which has been activated by Lulu and Yuna, Str bonus that erased
node carried is also 'lost' for Yuna and Lulu, ie their Str stat will drop by 3
when Str+3 node is erased.

Q11 - What are new abilities added in FFX PAL version?
A11 - Indeed we're lucky bastards...
- PILFER GIL (steal gil from enemies)
- NAB GIL (steal gil from enemies and deal damage at same time)
- FULL BREAK (Power, Armor, Magic and Mental Break on one enemy)
- QUICK POCKETS (use items quickly with reduced recovery time)
- EXTRACT POWER (target fiend drops Power Spheres)
- EXTRACT MANA (target fiend drops Mana Spheres)
- EXTRACT SPEED (target fiend drops Speed Spheres)
- EXTRACT ABILITY (target fiend drops Ability Spheres)

Q12 - Any other tips you can give me?
A12 - Let's see... Rather then collecting lots of SLV, use them to teach your
characters new abilities or to increase their attributes. Finally, save your
game when you enter SG. Thus, if you make a mistake, you can always reload.



=============================================================================
=============================================================================
IX) STANDARD SPHERE GRID ---> A849
=============================================================================
=============================================================================

In here you'll find info on how many Sphere Levels a certain character must
reach in order to learn all abilities on his/her path before reaching the end
of its path in case you chose Standard Sphere Grid (I'll make few exceptions of
course).
Don't understand what I mean? Don't worry, you'll soon get what I mean when you
throw a look a bit below.

Notes:
--> Some abilities require a certain character to stray a bit off from his or
her path (for example, Death). I'll include them as well.
--> Info on how many Sp. L. you need to gain is based on Standard Sphere Grid
--> It'll look like this example:
Name of ability - Sphere Levels needed
--> After you reach last ability on character's path, I'll suggest on what to
do next, for example, send Tidus down Auron's path or something similar

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I - TIDUS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cheer - 2                 | Flee - 5                 | Extract Speed - 11
Haste - 14                | Provoke - 22             | Delay Attack - 27
Slow - 40                 | Slowga - 53              | Delay Buster - 68
Hastega - 78              | Quick Hit - 105          |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHERE TO NEXT?: Tidus finishes his stroll very close to first third of Yuna's
path - which is the way I recommend to go. First wait a bit until you get Lv.3
Key Sp. to remove the annoying lock. Then move in to learn Shell, Protect and
Cura. Afterwards proceed in Yuna's direction...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
II - AURON
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Power Break - learned     | Extract Power - 7        | Guard - 10
Magic Break - 21          | Threaten - 40            | Armor Break - 48
Mental Break - 53         | Sentinel - 87            |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHERE TO NEXT?: Auron finishes close to Tidus' path. While Auron has HP and
Str, he lacks Agi and Eva, so I suggest going after Tidus. There's a small
matter removing Lv.2 Lock first tho'. After it's gone, learn Delay Attack and
Provoke, then proceed after Tidus' path.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
III - WAKKA
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dark Attack - learned     | Silence Attack - 7       | Extract Ability - 12
Aim - 20                  | Sleep Attack - 27        | Dark Buster - 41
Drain - 44                | Silence Buster - 56      | Sleep Buster - 68
Osmose - 77               | Triple Foul - 105        |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHERE TO NEXT?: Wakka's got the Acc, but not HP and sufficient Str. So Auron's
is the way to go. Remove Lv.3 Lock first, then have Wakka learn Armor Break,
after which go after Auron's path.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
IV - KIMAHRI
Oh boy, his is a little bit complicated. Namely, Kimahri's path does contain
few abilities, but once you learn them all, you'll have to decide what you want
Kimahri to be. White Mage, Black Mage, choice is yours...
However, I'd suggest sending him down Rikku's path, as having two characters
being able to steal always pays off. You may see a problem, tho'. Two Lv.1
Locks. Don't worry, by the time we send Kimahri on Rikku's path, you'll already
have a bunch of Lv.1 Key Spheres.
From Kimahri's position send him right first. My calculations are done based on
that decision.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lancet - learned          | Scan - 6                 | Extract Mana - 7
Jinx - 8*                 | At 45 Sp.L...**          | Steal - 52
Use - 53***               |                          |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* - now send him past Lancet ability up and travel all over these stat nodes to
improve Kimahri's stats
** - use your first Lv.1 Key Sp. to remove first lock and at 49 Sp.L. use your
second Lv.1 Key Sp. to remove second lock - you're now on Rikku's path
*** -  Here use Lv.2 Key Sp. to remove the lock and accumulate additional 3
Sp.L. to learn Dispel, then return on the path Rikku took

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
V - LULU
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fire - learned            | Water - learned          | Thunder - learned
Blizzard - learned        | Focus - 12               | Fira - 26
Thundara - 27             | Watera - 27              | Blizzara - 28
Reflex - 36               | Bio - 52                 | Demi - 68
Death - 75                | Waterga - 78             | Firaga - 79
Thundaga - 79             | Blizzaga - 79            | Flare - 104
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHERE TO NEXT?: Lulu's got the Eva and Mag, but not HP or Agi, so I'd actually
go for three choices. If you want to make her even more deadly, go after Yuna's
path (in this case use one of Teleport Spheres). If you want to make her fare
longer in battle, go after Auron's path (use Teleport Sphere as well). For Agi
go down Rikku's path (use Teleport Sphere).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
VI - RIKKU
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use - learned             | Steal - learned          | Luck - 11
Spare Change - 17         | Mug - 41                 | Bribe - 71
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHERE TO NEXT?: Tough call. Personally I'd make her HP bigger, so Auron's path
would be the way to go.
I've received an excellent tip from GamerZombie666 regarding Rikku. Once you
regain her back when crossing a large body of water on a certain animal, you'll
see that she starts very close to Reflect on the standard SG - there's only a
matter of Lv.2 Lock in the way. First Lv.2 Key Sp. you can obtain after getting
Rikku permanently is after beating Spherimorph boss in Macalania woods. So save
Rikku's SLVL until after beating boss mentioned, then use her SLVL to move over
SG toward Reflect node, use newly gained LV.2 Key Sp. to remove Lv.2 Lock and
Reflect is yours. It will prove mightily useful for later battles.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
VII - YUNA
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cure - learned            | Esuna - learned          | NulBlaze - 2
NulShock - 3              | NulFrost - 4             | NulTide - 5
Life - 14                 | Pray - 19                | Cura - 37
Shell - 43                | Protect - 48             | Reflect - 59
Dispel - 64               | At 65th Sp.L...*         | Steal - 68
Curaga - 82               | Regen - 89               | Holy - 106
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* have Yuna use Lv.2 Key Sp. to remove Lv.2 Lock - gain two more Sp.L. to learn
Use
WHERE TO NEXT?: If you keep going, you can get Full-Life for 12 SLVL ahead.
Once you get hold of some of spheres that teleport you across the grid, return
to start of Yuna's section (armed with LV.4 Key Sp. as well) and get Auto-
LifeSame call as with Lulu, so take a look below Lulu's section - where Lulu's
mentioned, substitute her name with Yuna's and you've got where you want to go.

=============================================================================
X) EXPERT SPHERE GRID ---> A838
=============================================================================
=============================================================================

This is an interesting section, especially for those who own PAL version. When
I first purchased FFX, I chose Expert grid, only to find myself later in the
game way underpowered since I didn't know how to utilize that grid. Instead of
gaining insane amounts of AP to backtrack, I quit and started new game, this
time with usual Sphere Grid. I finished the game with no problems that way
(well, if I don't count times I died in boss fights).

Q1 - What is Expert Sphere Grid (ESG)?
A1 - Expert Sphere Grid (ESG) is additional Sphere Grid (SG) you can choose
from when starting a new game. ESG is only available in FFX: PAL version and
FFX: International. It's not in the NTSC version of FFX.

Q2 - What are the differences between regular SG and ESG?
A2 - First big difference is starting point of all characters. All chrs, sans
Rikku start very close together. If you take a look at expert grid in your
game, you will see that Lv.1 Lock is all that separates Rikku from the rest of
the party (or vice versa, if you wish looking at it that way). According to my
notes, first Lv.1 Key Sphere is obtained at start of Mi'ihen highroad - so only
after that event you'll be able to remove the first (this one, if you like)
Lv.1 Lock.
Second difference is total amount of nodes available on ESG. ESG has 55 nodes
less than ordinary SG.
Third difference is 8 more abilities were added to PAL version. These abilities
are also on ordinary SG, but it feels right to mention them again:
- PILFER GIL (steal gil from enemies)
- NAB GIL (steal gil from enemies and deal damage at same time)
- FULL BREAK (Power, Armor, Magic and Mental Break on one enemy)
- QUICK POCKETS (use items quickly with reduced recovery time)
- EXTRACT POWER (target fiend drops Power Spheres)
- EXTRACT MANA (target fiend drops Mana Spheres)
- EXTRACT SPEED (target fiend drops Speed Spheres)
- EXTRACT ABILITY (target fiend drops Ability Spheres)

Q3 - Any recommendations on how to start with my characters when they join my
party (when using ESG)?
Note: For reference use the picture at following URL:
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/chr_start.jpg
A3 - I'd suggest the following course of action when playing ESG:
--> Tidus, Wakka, Lulu and Yuna learn Lancet - that way you'll be supplied with
endless stream of HP and MP, both of which you'll be able to get from random
enemies you'll encounter along the way
--> if you can spare some time, also have Kimahri and Tidus learn Dark Attack
--> then have Tidus, Wakka, Lulu and Kimahri learn Cure and Esuna
--> around now I'll assume you're able to fight Lord Ochu - kill him (make sure
you Overkill him) in order to receive 2x HP Sphere (if you get MP Spheres,
reset and kill him again) - use those two HP Spheres on two empty nodes near
Esuna and you'll gain quick 600 HP boost for all characters
--> after that is learned, have Yuna and Kimahri follow the path that leads to
Lulu's Thunder, Fire, Blizzard and Water spells - when you reach them,
naturally have them learn those spells
--> now you have a party of characters, all of which are able to cure status
ailments (no longer you have to rely on Yuna only), all of which are able to
restore lost HP (no longer you have to rely on Yuna only), all of which are
able to restore HP and MP at same time while weakening the monsters with help
of Lancet ability (no longer you have to rely on Save Points and Ethers, which
are hard to find) and three formidable black mages (no longer you need to rely
on Lulu only)
--> after this preparations are accomplished, distribute the characters back to
the way they used to be (you might want to have one more chr go up Tidus' path
until both Tidus and that other chr learn Haste)

This section remains as it is. I can't think of any reasonable way for the
characters to go or recommend to go. There is always a chance that a certain
skill is better in certain situation etc. I just can't. Apart from starting
tips I provided a bit up I leave you on your own path of choosing what's the
best for you.



=============================================================================
=============================================================================
XI) ABOUT MENUS
=============================================================================
=============================================================================

In this part I'll do my best to thoroughly explain each menu, submenu,
mastermenu and god knows what menus are there left. I'll decipher in-battle
menus first, then those that appear once a battle is over, then those you come
by when shopping or selling stuff, and finally the mastermind behind them all -
famous Bermuda Triangle, which appears once you press Triangle button whenever
on a field screen. *Shoots down UFO*. Better start before the invasion
begins...

*****************************************************************************
1A - BATTLE MENUS - MAIN COMMAND WINDOW
*****************************************************************************

This is the command menu you'll be using the most when in battle. It is located
in lower left of battle screen. It houses seven different commands you can
choose from. Not all are available from the start of game. But once you learn a
specific ability that falls into one of the command categories, that command
will become selectable. Each command, when chosen, will as next step require
you to select a target, or lead you to a submenu where even more options await
you. Have no fear, the explanations are here.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ATTACK        | attack an enemy with equipped weapon
Very simple. After you select Attack command, you'll be prompted to select one

1D - BATTLE MENUS - SENSOR WINDOW
*****************************************************************************

This helpful guy appears in upper left of battle screen in one of three cases:
someone in battle party has weapon with Sensor ability equipped, the fiend
targeted has been Scanned beforehand or aeon is summoned (aeons have innate
sensor ability). There are six lines of info that are helpful to your planning
of battle strategy.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
HP
This shows two numbers. First one is fiend's current HP, and the other is
fiend's MAX HP. By depleting first one to zero fiend is defeated.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
x1,5 SYMBOL, FOLLOWED BY FOUR CIRCLES*
This shows the elements fiend is weak against. Elements have following colors:
fire - red, lightning - yellow, water - blue, ice - white. So if you'd find a
red-filled circle in this line, this would mean that fiend is weak to fire
attacks and you should proceed using those attacks.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ SYMBOL, FOLLOWED BY FOUR CIRCLES*
This shows the elements fiend absorbs in shape of HP. You should avoid using
element attacks whose symbols appear in this line.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
/ SYMBOL, FOLLOWED BY FOUR CIRCLES*
This shows the elements fiend takes no damage from. While not beneficial to
anyone, avoid using element attacks whose symbols appear in this line.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1/2 SYMBOL, FOLLOWED BY FOUR CIRCLES*
This shows the element fiend is strong against, meaning it takes only half
damage from those element attacks. With only half as useful, also avoid using
element attacks whose symbols appear in this line.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BLUE WINDOW WITH STATUS AFFLICTIONS
This window shows names of all statuses fiend is currently afflicted with. If
more than one status is afflicted, it switches between them in one second
intervals.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SENSOR HELP WINDOW
This window appears on top of screen and shows two types of info: name of the
fiend, and a bit to the right a quick tip about fiend itself (may contain info
on fiend's attacks, fiend's weaknesses, or what to look out for...).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* - If certain element's color doesn't appear in any line, fiend takes normal
damage from that element. However, there is hidden fifth element, holy element
(only manifested thru Holy white magic or Blessed Gem). Fiends that resist,
absorb, nullify or are weak to holy element also exist. You can learn of these
elemental affinities only thru trial end error.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

damage from those element attacks. With only half as useful, also avoid using
element attacks whose symbols appear in this line.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMMUNITIES

with them no way whatsoever, even if hell freezes over... but as there have
always been exceptions, so are here.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCAN INFORMATION
Just a bit of information about target. Try scanning your party members!

commands will alter CTB order, with Overdrives having the biggest recharge
time, and Quick Pockets having the quickest recharge time. There are abilities
available that can speed up your party's turns (Haste), slow down enemy's
(Slow), or delay enemy's (Delay Attack). Careful planning of what to use is

attacks.

freely in battle, suiting your needs for enemy eradication. It will show you
list of available party members that can be switched in for a chr you currently
think is not useful. Select one of other chrs and press X. Chr that is not
needed will exit the screen and chr you selected will join the battle. Note
that no turns are lost during the switch, so you can switch members as many
times as you want. You cannot switch members that are KO-ed, were
petrified/shattered, or have escaped from battle.

*****************************************************************************
3A - TRIANGLE BUTTON MENU - SPHERE GRID HEADING
*****************************************************************************

Section VIII covers all aspects of SG, so check it out.

*****************************************************************************
3B - TRIANGLE BUTTON MENU - ITEM HEADING
*****************************************************************************

You'll spend quite a bit of time with your best friends, the items. What
follows is explanation of Item screen...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- as usual, the top of the screen is reserved for help line that tells you what
a selected item does when used
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- below is a line with four commands:
USE:       Let's you use items in your inventory. Note that only a fraction
           of items is usable, ie those that restore HP and MP - items that
           cannot be used are greyed out. To use say Potion, place the cursor
           on it and press X button. A small window containing all currently
           available chrs will appear, for each showing current HP and MP.
           Select chr you want to use Potion on and press X to complete the
           healing. Reapply as necessary, and press Circle to exit this
           submenu.
SORT:      Let's you sort out items in your inventory, either Auto or Manual.
           By selecting Auto items will be arranged automatically, and by
           selecting Manual you're in the control. Place the cursor at an
           item you wish to put somewhere else and press X. Blinking cursor
           will appear near first selected item. What you do now is position
           another cursor at the second item. When X is pressed again, these
           two items will switch places.
           Note: The order in which items are arranged also affects order of
           items when accessed in battles.
EQUIPMENT: Let's you view the equipment you've acquired so far and, similar
           to items, enable you to sort them manually or automatically. When
           Auto is selected, equipment is sorted in 'chr fashion', ie first
           weapons and then armors for a certain chr. For Manual place the
           cursor at an eq. piece you wish to put somewhere else and press X.
           Blinking cursor will appear near first selected eq. piece. What
           you do now is position another cursor at the second eq. piece.
           When X is pressed again, these two eq. pieces will switch places.
KEY ITEMS: Simple enough. Phew. In this submenu all you can do is view key
           items you've acquired so far
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- and lastly, most of the rest of the screen is reserved for items you
currently possess; first a name of the item, then in the black circle amount of
that particular item
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

*****************************************************************************
3C - TRIANGLE BUTTON MENU - ABILITY HEADING
*****************************************************************************

Yippee. Another easy one. Once you select this heading, select one of the chrs
whose abilities you want to see. Once done, a list of abilities chr has learned
so far is displayed. As usual, top line is helpful information on what the
ability does. While here, you can also use Cure, Cura and Curaga to heal chrs
in need of HP - process is much the same as when selecting an item you wish to
use (but you do need a sufficient MP). That's all.

*****************************************************************************
3D - TRIANGLE BUTTON MENU - OVERDRIVE HEADING
*****************************************************************************

Pick this, then select a chr you wish to view overdrive info for. Screen is
outlined like this...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- top of the screen is reserved for help line telling what a selected overdrive
or ov. mode does
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- below is line with two commands:
VIEW:     Let's you view all of chr's overdrives he/she has acquired so far.
SET MODE: In here you can view all of chr's ov. modes he/she learned so far.
          Move around available modes with directional buttons and press X on
          selected mode to have chr switch to that ov. mode. For example,
          Lulu is using Stoic mode, but you'd like her to switch to Victor.
          So in Set Mode screen seek out Victor entry, press X when mode is
          selected and voila! Lulu's ov. gauge now fills according to Victor.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- then chr's info with name, HP, MP and SLVL
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- then name of chr's Overdrive, ov. gauge (shows how full it currently is) and
name of ov. mode currently set by that chr
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- lastly list of all available overdrives (move around with directionals)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

*****************************************************************************
3E - TRIANGLE BUTTON MENU - EQUIP HEADING
*****************************************************************************

Use this to properly outfit the characters so that they can win easily. First
the explanation of Equip screen.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- top line is help line
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- below is chr's line with name, HP, MP and SLVL
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- then chr's picture, ov. gauge and ov. mode currently in use by that chr
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- then currently equipped weapon and armor (note that you cannot de-equip a
weapon, but you can de-equip an armor)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- bottom left of the screen is where all pieces of equipment for selected chr
will appear
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- bottom right of the screen lists auto-abilities of currently selected weapon
or armor
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

First choice to be done is to choose what you want to change, weapon or armor.
Let's say you'd like to change Lulu's armor. Move the cursor down and press X.
Cursor will move to bottom left of the screen, where all available armors for
Lulu will appear. Move between them with Up/Down directions. You will see a
small purple triangle by the name of one of the armors - use this to identify
the armor Lulu is currently equipped with. Use bottom right of the screen to
view auto-abilities of armors as you browse thru them. Once you know which
armor you want to equip, press X to complete the change (note that when
equipping armor whose abilities might cause MAX HP and/or MP to be reduced,
you'll be asked to confirm the change).
Same procedure is used when equipping weapons. That's it for this section.

*****************************************************************************
3F - TRIANGLE BUTTON MENU - STATUS HEADING
*****************************************************************************

Once picked, select chr whose status you'd like to see. There are six screens
you can browse thru, each of them explained below.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1ST SCREEN CONTAINS
- chr's name, HP, MP and SLVL
- chr's pic, how full ov. gauge is, ov. mode selected, and current equipment
- finally listed are chr's statistics
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2NS SCREEN CONTAINS
- let's you view auto-abilities of currently equipped weapon and armor
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3RD SCREEN CONTAINS
- let's you view skills selected chr has learned so far
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4TH SCREEN CONTAINS
- let's you view specials selected chr has learned so far
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
5TH SCREEN CONTAINS
- let's you view white magic selected chr has learned so far
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
6TH SCREEN CONTAINS
- let's you view black magic selected chr has learned so far
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

*****************************************************************************
3G - TRIANGLE BUTTON MENU - AEONS HEADING
*****************************************************************************

This one is huge and a pain to do. Explanation follows...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- top line is help line, as usual by now
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- then command line with three choices: Status, Abilities and Attributes (note
that only Status is available from the start, you have to earn Abilities and
Attributes). Look for 1* mark a little below to find thorough explanation for
these three commands.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- most of right side of the screen is reserved for aeons you've acquired so
far, showing their name and HP/MP
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- by placing a cursor over one of the names small picture of selected aeon will
appear on the left
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1* - Hey! At this place I will teach you how to utilize Status, Abilities and
Attributes commands, which are selectable in Aeons heading.
--> STATUS
Shows you status of a selected aeon. Aeon's has 5 screens, with only the first
being a little different, and the rest being exactly the same as by chr's.
Aeon's first status screen looks like this:
- help line at top, with command line below it
- then aeon's name, HP, MP and how full ov. gauge is
- then aeon's pic, name of special attack and name of overdrive
- finally aeon's stats
By pressing X up to four times you can view skills, specials, white and black
magic selected aeon has learned so far. That's it for Status part.
--> ABILITIES
Use this to teach your aeons new abilities, like Full Break and Ultima. Once
Abilities command is selected, select an aeon you wish to bring by something
new (some aeons can't be taught new abilities). Another rather complicated
submenu will appear with following entries...
- help line at top, with 3-commands line below it
- aeon's name, HP/MP and ov. gauge
- in lower left a list of abilities available for learning is displayed
- in middle right item cost for selected ability to be taught is displayed
- and finally, by pressing Triangle you can scroll thru abilities aeon has
already learned so far
There's something I have to warn you about. Here's the example.
Dark Attack is first ability that is listed in 'Ability to learn' menu. But in
order to learn it, you need 6 Smoke Bombs. Which brings me to my 'warning':
Dark Attack will appear as available ability to be learned only after you've
acquired some Smoke Bombs. If you have no Smoke Bombs in your inventory, Dark
Attack ability will not be shown.
Item cost entry looks like this: first you'll see name of the item you need for
selected ability to be learned, followed by two black circles. In first total
amount of item currently in your inventory is shown, and in second amount of
item that will be left after learning is done. Subtract second number from
first to get the amount of items needed for ability to be learned.
So how do you learn an ability? Step by step guide:
1. Select Abilities in 3-commands line.
2. Select an aeon to be taken into protective custody of Dr. Tidus (Shiva).
3. Scroll Up/Down on the list of abilities available (use help line for info on
what the ability does). Abilities your aeon already knows or you don't have
enough items for will be greyed out (also, a warning window will pop up telling
you what is the reason that the ability can't be learned).
4. Let's say you'd like to teach Shiva Dark Attack. Press X (check in Item Cost
section to see how many items will be spent) and confirmation window will pop
up asking to confirm the process. Move cursor to yes and Shiva has learned Dark
Attack. Repeat as needed for other aeons/abilities and you've mastered the art
of disguise... erm, I mean teaching.
--> ATTRIBUTES
Use this to raise aeons' stats, like HP and MP. Once Attributes command is
selected, select an aeon you wish to improve. Another rather complicated
submenu will appear with following entries...
- help line at top, with 3-commands line below it
- aeon's name, HP/MP and ov. gauge
- in lower left a list of stats will appear (10 stats can be increased)
- in middle right item cost for selected stat to be raised is displayed
Item cost entry looks like this: first you'll see name of the item you need for
selected stat to be raised, followed by two black circles. In first total
amount of item currently in your inventory is shown, and in second amount of
item that will be left after raising is done. Subtract second number from first
to get the amount of items needed for a stat to be raised. HP is raised in
increments of 100, MP in increments of 10, and the rest of the staff will be
satisfied by 1 point increment.
So how do you raise a stat? Step by step guide:
1. Select Attributes in 3-commands line.
2. Select an aeon to be taken into learning custody of Dr. Tidus (Shiva).
3. Scroll Up/Down on the list of stats. Stats you don't have enough items for
or if aeon has already reached max value for that stat (HP 99999, MP 9999, the
rest 255) will be greyed out (also, a warning window will pop up telling you
what is the reason that the stat can't be increased).
4. Let's say you'd like to increase Shiva's HP. Press X (check in Item Cost
section to see how many items will be spent) and confirmation window will pop
up asking to confirm the process. Move cursor to yes and Shiva/s HP has
increased by 100. Repeat as needed for other aeons/stats and you've mastered
the art of raising stats.

*****************************************************************************
3H - TRIANGLE BUTTON MENU - FORMATION HEADING
*****************************************************************************

This option allows you to switch between members who will appear in frontline
party when the battle begins. Pick chr you'd like to switch out and press X for
a blinking cursor to appear. Then search out chr you'd like to switch in and
press X again to complete the switch process. That's it!
Note: No character enjoys and benefits from occupying first, second or third
position.

*****************************************************************************
3I - TRIANGLE BUTTON MENU - CUSTOMIZE HEADING
*****************************************************************************

Okay, last big bastard and then I'm outta here. First an overview of how
Customize screen looks like...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- who wants to make a really wild guess what's at the top?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- in next line chr's name will appear, HP, MP and SLVL
Note: Name that appears depends on piece of equipment you're having selected
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- in lower left list of all pieces of equipment you currently have in your
possession will be shown (small purple triangle denotes that a certain piece of
equipment is equipped by a certain character)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- once you place the pointer at one piece of equipment, take a look at lower
right of the screen to learn what kind of abilities have been melted into it
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's make an example of putting Curseproof on Lulu's Tetra Bangle in this
following step-by-step guide.
1. Pick Customize heading.
2. Find Tetra Bangle and select it.
3. You'll be taken to another submenu with a handful of available armor auto-
abilities, found in leftmost part of the screen. As you scroll thru abilities,
middle right of the screen will show name and amount of items needed for
specific ability to be added. Lower right shows name of selected equipment
(Tetra Bangle in this case) and names of abilities that may have already been
added, as well as any remaining empty slots (in this case no abilities have
been added yet, and four empty slots are available).
4. Find Curseproof. Take a look at Item Cost window. As you see, you'll need
Tetra Elemental item for this ability. How much? This is what numbers in two
black circles below will tell you. Subtract second number from first and you
get amount of items needed (if second circle has a minus inside, that means you
don't have enough items available).
5. Select Curseproof and confirmation window will pop up asking you to complete
the process. Do so by selecting yes and process is complete (note that in most
cases adding an ability to piece of equipment might change its name - in this
case Tetra Bangle changes to Medical Bangle).
6. Exact same procedure applies for weapon upgrading.
7. Here are some exceptions you need to be aware of:
- you can't upgrade certain weapons at all
- you can't upgrade a weapon with a certain ability if you don't have enough
items to add that ability, if superior ability is already present (you can't
add Darkward if armor already has Darkproof), if ability is already present on
a piece of equipment or if there are no free slots left
- for Curseproof you need Tetra Elementals... but as long as you don't have any
Tetra Elementals in your stock, Curseproof ability will not be displayed; once
you lay your hands on few Tetra Elementals, Curseproof ability will show up for
you to choose
With this I hand over the goods you need to know about successfully upgrading
your equipment.

3K - TRIANGLE BUTTON MENU - HELP HEADING
*****************************************************************************

This is a help menu of a help menu, heh. Enter this section to be taken to
detailed explanations of controls, basic battle terms and explanations of
Overdrives, Overdrive Modes, auto-abilities and command abilities.



=============================================================================
=============================================================================
XII) ABOUT BATTLES
=============================================================================
=============================================================================

*****************************************************************************
PART 1 - BATTLE PREPARATIONS
*****************************************************************************
1. First select three characters you'll be using (exceptions apply for battles
where you have less than three characters or you're forced to be using certain
chr/s). Until comfortable with all chrs, I suggest having one heavy hitter
(Auron/Kimahri/Wakka), mage (if going offensively Lulu/if going defensively
Yuna) and a speedy character (Rikku/Tidus).
2. Equip your chrs prior to battles. ALWAYS wear a piece of armor. Weapon is a
mandatory piece of equipment, so don't bother trying to be weaponless, cos you
can't. Yes, I know that you can't predict what lies in future battle, but
you're better off having at least something equipped than having nothing.
3. Always save whenever you see Save Sphere. They are invaluable to your
progress. Not only do they restore party's and aeons' HP/MP to full, but once
you're after a certain tough spot in the game, you'll have a deep Phew! after
not having to repeat it again, should you encounter a game over afterwards.

*****************************************************************************
PART 2 - BATTLE START
*****************************************************************************

As you wander around in Field screen, suddenly a TV screen will shatter! Not
literally, but it is your warning that random battle has just issued! One of
three possible encounter setups await you:

1. Your party encounters enemy party and CTB window is outlined based on every
member's and fiend's Agi stat. Further divisions are possible.
- if every member's Agi is higher than Agi of fastest fiend, all your party
members will have a turn before fiends or may even have multiple turns before
first fiend even gets to act
Example 1: Party is Yuna with 30 Agi, Lulu with 33 Agi and Rikku with 45 Agi.
Enemy party consists of Dingo with 25 Agi. As you see, Dingo is slower than
three gals, so each of them will get a shot at it.
Example 2: Party is Yuna with 30 Agi, Lulu with 33 Agi and Rikku with 45 Agi.
Enemy party consists of Killer Bee with 14 Agi. As you see, Killer Bee is much
slower than three gals, so each of them will get two turns, Rikku even three
before Killer Bee even gets to act.
- if every members' Agi is lower than Agi of slowest fiend, each fiend will get
a turn before your fastest member gets to act; fiends may get to act multiple
times in case their Agi is enormous
Example 3: Party is Yuna with 30 Agi, Lulu with 33 Agi and Rikku with 45 Agi.
Enemy party consists of Dingo with 50 Agi. As you see, Dingo is faster than
three gals, so Dingo will act first.
Example 4: Party is Yuna with 30 Agi, Lulu with 33 Agi and Rikku with 45 Agi.
Enemy party consists of Killer Bee with 90 Agi. As you see, Killer Bee is much
faster than three gals, Killer Bee will get two turns before first member
(Rikku in this case) gets to act.
- if members' and fiends' Agi is a mixed bag, then CTB order goes from fastest
Agi to slowest Agi
Example 5: Party is Yuna with 30 Agi, Lulu with 33 Agi and Rikku with 45 Agi.
Enemy party consists of Dingo with 40 Agi. As you see, Rikku goes first, then
Dingo, then Lulu and finally Yuna.

2. Your party is ambushed by enemy party. You'll know so by word 'Ambushed!'
that appears at the top of battle screen. All fiends will act first. It doesn't
matter how high member's Agi is, fiends will always get to act first. Once
fiends use the advantage of free attack, CTB order returns to regular program,
ie calculating Agi of every member/fiend and outlining CTB order based on that.
For more info on how that is done look at point 1. of this section.

3. Your party ambushes enemy party. You'll know so by words 'Pre-emptive
strike!' that appears at top of battle screen. All members will go first,
regardless of Agi stat of the fiends. Once members use the advantage of free
attack, CTB order returns to regular program, ie calculating Agi of every
member/fiend and outlining CTB order based on that. For more info on how that
is done look at point 1. of this section.

4. Initiative ability
Increases your chances of gaining 'Pre-emptive strike!' advantage and reduces
enemy's chances of getting 'Ambushed!' advantage.

5. First Strike ability
Allows wielder to act first at beginning of any battle, regardless of Agi stat
of members/fiends and regardless of being ambushed. Only exception to this rule
is Varuna's Haste, in case you encounter it in O. Ruins.

*****************************************************************************
PART 3 - MEMBER'S TURN
*****************************************************************************

So a member of your party gets a turn. There's many things you can do now, each
explained below.

1. Select Attack to attack your enemy with equipped weapon. Once you have
confirmed the target fiend you want to attack, one of these outcomes may occur
(say damage done is 100 to make things easier for me to explain):
- fiend struck takes 100 damage; this is the outcome that'll occur the most
- fiend struck takes 200 damage (followed by a small screen flash); denotes
that fiend took a critical strike; chances of critical strike are increased
with higher Luck
- fiend struck takes 200 damage; denotes that fiend was struck with weapon
bearing an element fiend is weak against / fiend is Armor Breaked; continue
using that weapon / continue using any weapon
- fiend evades the attack; denotes that fiend's Eva is superior to member's
Acc; either use the character with higher Acc or improve member's Acc
- fiend is struck, but absorbs damage as 100 HP restored; denotes that fiend
was struck with weapon bearing an element fiend absorbs; discontinue using that
weapon or try other element attacks
- fiend is struck, but takes 0 damage or word Immune appears; denotes that
fiend was struck with weapon bearing an element fiend is immune to / status
ability enemy is immune to; discontinue using that element or try other element
attacks / try other statuses
- fiend is struck, but takes 50 damage; denotes that fiend was struck with
weapon bearing an element fiend is strong against / fiend is armored;
discontinue using that element or try other element attacks / use weapons with
Piercing ability, try Armor Break or switch to magic attacks
- fiend is struck, but a blue multi-hexagon barrier appears reducing damage
done by 50%; denotes fiend is under Protect; use Dispel or switch to magic
attacks
- fiend is struck, takes damage, but then the fiend responds to the attacker by
attacking him/her (note that this doesn't require a turn); denotes fiend is
capable of countering physical attacks; switch to magic attacks

2. Select Skill or Special and then choose one of abilities displayed to either
improve party's status or cripple enemy's. Note that most Skills have longer
recharge time (in aspect to selecting Attack) and most Specials have shorter
recharge time (in aspect to selecting Attack).
- Skills are used mainly to inflict fiends with status disorder and at same
time dealing some damage. Use them as needed, but take care of MP. Also take
note that element properties of weapons used still come into play, meaning even
if you successfully Full Break a Bomb, if weapon you used has Firestrike,
damage done will be absorbed.
- Specials are mostly used to aid party's status. Most are free of MP charge,
so fire away at them.

3. White Magic and Black Magic are core of existence for magic wielders. Black
magic is to be used against enemies, whilst white magic aids party members.
When black magic is used (also count Holy here), following can happen... (say
damage done is 100 to make things easier for me to explain):
- fiend struck takes 100 damage; this is the outcome that'll occur the most
- fiend struck takes 200 damage; denotes that fiend was struck with element
magic fiend is weak against / fiend is Mental Breaked; continue using that
magic / continue using any magic
- fiend is struck, but absorbs damage as 100 HP restored; denotes that fiend
was struck with element magic bearing an element fiend absorbs; discontinue
using that element magic
- fiend is struck, but takes 0 damage or word Immune appears; denotes that
fiend was struck with element magic bearing an element fiend is immune to /
status magic enemy is immune to; discontinue using that element magic / try
other status magic
- fiend is struck, but takes 50 damage; denotes that fiend was struck with
element magic bearing an element fiend is strong against; discontinue using
that element magic, try Mental Break or switch to other element magic
- fiend is struck, but a red three-circle barrier appears reducing damage done
by 50%; denotes fiend is under Shell; use Dispel or switch to physical attacks
- fiend is struck, takes damage, but then the fiend responds to the attacker by
attacking him/her (note that this doesn't require a turn); denotes fiend is
capable of countering magic attacks; switch to physical attacks
- just as fiend is to be struck, a 'half-of-the-blue-ball' barrier appears and
magic caster is struck instead; denotes fiend is under Reflect; use Dispel or
switch to physical attacks

White magic works just a bit differently:
- instead of restoring HP, member being healed takes damage; denotes member is
under Zombie; remove Zombie
- member is aided, but a red three-circle barrier appears reducing the healing
effect by 50%; denotes member is under Shell; use Dispel or switch to other
means of aiding, like items
- just as member is to be aided, a 'half-of-the-blue-ball' barrier appears and
one of the fiends is aided instead; denotes member is under Reflect; use Dispel
or switch to other means of aiding, like items

4. Items are to be used mainly for healing party members and restoring status.
Recharge time for item command is shorter than that of selecting Attack.

5. Summon (Yuna only) allows you to summon an aeon, who will take the fighting
all for himself (or herself!). Aeon's menu works much like member's.

6. Overdrive (available only if ov. gauge is full) allows chrs to perform
especially strong techs. Overdrives also have longest recharge time, so know
CTB well before you use them.

7. Switch equipment allows you to switch between weapons and armor to suit your
battle needs. Couple of examples below.
--> If you have Firestrike weapon and your opponent is a Bomb, you won't do
well against it. In fact, you'll restore HP to Bomb as it absorbs fire element.
But Bomb is weak versus ice and if you have Icestrike weapon in your stock,
switch to it and your odds have just improved dramatically.
--> If enemy Dingo is constantly putting you to sleep, that means you don't
have Sleepproof armor on yourself. Check the stock to see if you have such
armor available. If yes, equip it and Dingo's status changing attacks have just
been exterminated.
See? By experimenting and proceeding further in the game it won't take long
before you become an expert in the field.

8. Escape lets one chr flee from battle in case you believe 'Odds are against
us...'. You may not always succeed and you can't flee from most boss battles.

9. Switch is used when you believe that chr who is currently up, isn't quite
useful according to battle situation. Press L1 and select more appropriate chr,
and finally press X to complete the switch. Example follows.
- Your party is Yuna, Lulu and Rikku against Bunyip (armored mole enemy type).
It's Rikku's turn before Bunyip's. Not too good. Why? None of the gals have
particularly high Str and Bunyip is quite strong vs magic. Chr that is good
against armored mole enemies is Auron. So press L1, seek out Auron and switch
him in. Select Attack and point to Bunyip, who disappears in cloud of
pyreflies.

10. Defend is used when you can't think of anything particularly useful to be
done. Defend reduces physical damage done until next turn for 50%, but chr
defending still takes full magic damage.

*****************************************************************************
PART 4 - FIEND'S TURN
*****************************************************************************

Now for some of possible outcomes when fiend physically attacks a member.
- member struck takes 100 damage; this is the outcome that'll occur the most
- member struck takes 200 damage (followed by a small screen flash); denotes
member took a critical strike
- member is struck and takes 200 damage; denotes member is Armor Breaked; cast
Dispel on that member
- member evades the attack; denotes member's Eva is superior to fiend's Acc
- member is struck, but absorbs damage as 100 HP restored; denotes member was
struck with element attack bearing an element member absorbs (only fiend's
attack so far that falls in this category is Bomb's Self-Destruct)
- member is struck, but takes 0 damage or word Immune appears; denotes member
was struck with element attack (Bomb's Self-Destruct) bearing an element member
is immune to / status attack member is immune to
- member is struck, but takes 50 damage; denotes member was struck with element
attack (Bomb's Self-Destruct) bearing an element member is strong against
- member is struck, but a blue multi-hexagon barrier appears reducing damage
done by 50%; denotes member is under Protect
- member is struck, takes damage, but then the member responds to the fiend
attacker by attacking it (note that this doesn't require a turn); denotes
member is capable of countering physical attacks

And the outcomes that'll occur by magical attack...
- member struck takes 100 damage; this is the outcome that'll occur the most
- member struck takes 200 damage; member is Mental Breaked; cast Dispel on that
member
- member is struck, but absorbs damage as 100 HP restored; denotes member was
struck with element magic bearing an element member absorbs
- member is struck, but takes 0 damage or word Immune appears; denotes member
was struck with element magic bearing an element member is immune to / status
magic member is immune to
- member is struck, but takes 50 damage; denotes member was struck with element
magic bearing an element member is strong against
- member is struck, but a red three-circle barrier appears reducing damage done
by 50%; denotes member is under Shell
- member is struck, takes damage, but then the member responds to the fiend
attacker by attacking it (note that this doesn't require a turn); denotes
member is capable of countering magic attacks
- just as member is to be struck, a 'half-of-the-blue-ball' barrier appears and
magic caster is struck instead; denotes member is under Reflect

*****************************************************************************
PART 5 - MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION AND GOOD-TO-KNOW-STUFF
*****************************************************************************

In here I'll list down any helpful info or hints I can think of to ease the
suffering of poor fiends that try to get in your way... and in case they
succeed, what to do to fix the situation.

1. You lose control of a chr if he/she is berserked, confused, petrified, KO-
ed. Berserk is not necessarily bad, as chr continues to attack fiends with
increased Str, you just can't control that chr. Confused chr will always attack
allies, so quickly use Esuna or Remedy on such chr. Petrified chr is a mixed
bag... if chr receives an attack whose damage is greater than current HP (there
are exceptions), such chr will shatter and be gone from this battle permanently
- Soft OR Esuna used quickly will ensure that will never happen. KO-ed chr is
of no use to you, therefore Phoenix Down or Life will give that chr a new
chance.

2. Increase your party's amount of turns available by increasing Agi. You can
do so in many ways: Haste, Hastega, Chocobo Feather, Chocobo Wing.

3. Decrease enemy party's amount of turns available by decreasing their Agi or
incurring certain statuses. Decrease fiends' Agi with Slow or Slowga, or use
Delay skills to let fiends never even get the attack in. Putting fiends to
sleep and then whacking them with magic attacks is also an excellent way of
winning the battle.

4. Augment your Def and Mdef with Protect and Shell respectively (both increase
the resistance by 50%).

5. Make enemies hit themselves with magic by having Reflect on (for permanent
effect wear Auto-Reflect armor).

6. Each attack enemy does to you will make them feel the pain right back with
help of Counter-Attack and Magic Counter weapons (Sentinel and Counter-Attack
make a very good combo). Note that you cannot counter multi-target attacks.

7. Steal from enemies often. You will need a lot of items later in the game
which will help you in tougher fights or you'll need them to make a proper
weapon or armor.

8. Always try to have chr who is good against specific enemies kill that enemy,
therefore ending the battle as quickly as possible. That means like this...
Rikku - robotic enemies
Lulu - flan enemies and element enemies
Yuna - super-strong enemies (like Land Worm and Zu), for she can summon
Tidus - nimble enemies (wolf and lizard enemies)
Wakka - flying enemies
Auron, Kimahri - armored enemies

*****************************************************************************
PART 6 - BATTLE END
*****************************************************************************

Battle is over when:
- all of the fiends are killed and / or have escaped
- your party fled the battle
- your party was killed or petrified (but as long as at least one chr manages
to escape, you do not get Game Over)

*****************************************************************************
PART 7 - POST BATTLE
*****************************************************************************

So enemies have been toasted, AP distributed and items, equipment and Gil
received. What to do before next battle?

1. First, heal up any members who suffered heavy wounds (any KO-ed or shattered
allies are restored with 1 HP; also any status changes chr was afflicted with
at end of battle are gone).

2. Check the equipment your chrs wear. If you feel it doesn't do well against
enemies you fought, make proper changes. Hopefully you were 'lucky' enough to
get a taste of everything possible fiend can throw at you, therefore making
your decision what to use in next battles easier. Aside making equipment
changes in triangle menu you can also change equipment inside battles, you
know.

3. Practice makes perfect! Keep in mind that there are many generic type
enemies you'll meet thru the game. They are no different from their brethren
other than in name, color and stats. Once you encounter another enemy of say
wolf-type, you'll already know that Tidus is the best option to dispose of it.

4. Keep your eyes peeled! At top left corner of the screen you'll see a mini-
map. Red arrow will be pointing you in the right direction. Green squares mark
entrances and exits, white squares show save spheres. Also remember to check
everywhere and to talk to as many people as you can - doing so may yield many
useful items and equipment.

701 - ZANARKAND
Enemies: Sinscale, Sinspawn Ammes (BOSS)
Items: 2x Potion
Weapons: Longsword
Key Items: None
*****************************************************************************

When you have control of main character, move to the bunch of people you'll see
on the pier. Talk with three kids, name your character, then talk with two
girls. Talk with left one again to hit (on) her. When done, just wait a bit.
You're now on a long driveway. Go along it until the end. Talk to every person
you see for some funny responses. One of the gals (pink top, yellow tights) you
talk to on this highway will give you 2x Potion (when asked if you have some
spare tickets, say that you do). Have a laugh or two (heh), then proceed inside
(if you wait long enough, Tidus will go in by himself).
You'll now view an amazing blitzball sequence. But everything that looks like a
ball is not friendly... Some flying 'balls' mean trouble. Your new ally will
hand Tidus Longsword (no abilities) and it's battle time. As this is first
battle of the game, it's easy - enemy doesn't attack you. BTW, your item stock
is currently composed of 10x Potion (12x Potion if you offered tickets to the
gal on the road) and 3x Phoenix Down. I'd advise you to KO your ally for this
battle and cripple Tidus' HP in yellow, ie below 50% MAX HP. Once you do that,
continuously defend with Tidus until he learns Daredevil and Loner overdrive
modes. Once both modes are learned, use Phoenix Down on your comrade, have him
KO Tidus and continuously defend as well until he too learns Daredevil and
Loner modes. When done, use Phoenix Down on Tidus and kill that lonely enemy.
When this battle ends, it's not over yet. Another awaits you. This time you're
attacked from both sides, 3x Sinscale in front and 2x Sinscale behind your
back. Listen to the advice of your comrade-in-arms and attack Sinscales that
block your path forward. These five Sinscales still do not attack and this is
also a perfect opportunity for both chrs to learn Slayer mode (but make sure
that you only target Sinscales behind your back; if you kill the three in
front, battle will end). It may be boring a bit, but do persevere, for you'll
see that Slayer mode is among the best ones. After three Sincales in front are
defeated, you'll reach your goal: first boss!

a) Demi - GRATT VS all chrs - mgd - tears off 25% of current HP
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY | A boss already (with five soon-to-be-killed Sinscales) and we
haven't had a chance to save yet. Fret not, you can't die in this battle if you
swing your joypad right (picks up few teeth scattered around...). Take a look:
Your other party member will have an Overdrive ready. Press left in command
window to bring up Overdrive command. Select it, then select Dragon Fang. If
you accidentally mess up, Dragon Fang will take care of all Sinscales anyway.
So that leaves only Ammes. Demi, Demi, Demi. Even if you're really low on HP,
you can't die. All you have to do is repeatedly attack Ammes until it bites the
flies.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

'Zanarkand: Overpass'
Yay. Save sphere. Save! Then go to right of the screen. After a bit of running
you'll again fall into a battle against Sinscales. Yawn. Rinse and repeat the
last fight you had with them - attack the ones whose turn will come up soonest,
but make priority on the ones whose wings start to flicker. After a while your
comrade will suggest attacking the generator which will now become a legit
target. Attack it a few times (ignore Sinscales!) and generator will take care
of the rest...

Weapons: None
Key Items: Flint, Withered Bouquet
*****************************************************************************

'Submerged ruins'
Where are we? Press Circle to dive until game takes over. Where are we now?
Geez, swimming again. Before you exit this area in the far north exit, explore
the ruins. You'll find two treasure chests (one containing 200 Gil, the other
2x Potion), and Al Bhed Compilation Sphere (useless if you're playing for the
first time, BUT if that's your second time thru the game, do examine that
compilation sphere and choose to pull Al Bhed Primers from your other save/s
into your current game) and a strange insignia on the pillar written in funny
language. Done all that? We have nothing left to do here, so swim to far north
exit.

'Ruins: Underwater hall'
As you enter make left turns until you reach a chest with Hi-Potion. Backtrack
and take the other path. Dive and swim in obvious direction... all this to pick
a fight? Three Sahagins will try to make short work of you.

a) 'Punch' - GRATTP VS one chr - phd - tears off 50% current HP
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY | After two Sahagins kick the bucket, Geosgaeno shows up. It'll kill
remaining Sahagin and then turn on you. An intimidating amount of HP VS Tidus'
puny amount of HP. A battle that cannot be won? Indeed it is. So what do you
do? Just exchange blows with each other. Don't use any Potions! Geo's punch is
gravity based and cannot kill you, ever. After Geo hits you for the third time,
battle is over.**
* - Acquired with help of AR2.
** - With help of cheats it is possible to defeat Geosgaeno. However, you don't
get anything for it.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

'Ruins: Corridor'
Cough, cough. If I never see another fish, it'll be too soon. Drat, trapped
again. Simply go up the stairs.

'Ruins: Hall'
You've reached a big room with dead campfire in the middle. Right doors can't
be opened... but push to the right of this door to have the screen shift a bit
in order to find an area with a chest containing X-Potion! Now what would
MacGyver do? Left doors lead to a messed up room...

'Ruins: Small Room'
Examine the crushed desk where you must pick up a Flint *KEY ITEM*. Exit to
previous big room and go in the back.

'Ruins: Stairs'
When on this new screen, check the bottom of the screen for Ether. Climb the
stairs and pick up Withered Bouquet *KEY ITEM*. Don't go back yet. You'll reach
the balcony of 'Ruins: Hall'. On the end is another chest with Hi-Potion.
You've done all you can for now. Return to campfire and press X...

a) 'Swipe' - VS one chr - phd
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY | Keep Potions handy. Your first boss battle where you have to be a
bit careful! Well, you still can't pull off any fancy moves, so you're left
with tried-and-tested strategy of hitting Klikk and using a Potion when your HP
is at 150. Klikk can hit you for about 100 damage. Once Klikk loses 750 HP...
hmm, who's this? Reinforcements have arrived! Now you can try out a few new
tricks. BTW, Klikk's HP is restored to 1500. (Thanks to Gestahl for this.) New
comrade's commands include Use (allows you to use items you cannot use with
Item command) and Steal (character will attempt to steal from the enemy). Have
your comrade Use Grenades on Klikk and have Tidus attack as usual (remember to
heal yourself if damaged badly). If you run out of Grenades, you can steal some
from Klikk. And 'Give what you get!'.

703 - SALVAGE SHIP
Enemies: Piranha, Tros (BOSS)
Items: 3x Potion
Weapons: None
Key Items: Primer I
*****************************************************************************

'Salvage Ship: Deck'
Blah blah. It's time for you to learn how to use Sphere Grid, so pay attention.
For info on amount of Sp.L. you need to reach next ability, look at my handy
section IX of this guide. After tutorial is over, pick up a strange small
object on the deck of ship. It turns out to be Al Bhed Primer Vol. I *KEY
ITEM*. These books allow you to understand Al Bhed language once you have all
of them. Talking with one of male Al Bheds will net you 3x Potion. Then talk to
female Al Bhed and off we go. Let's salvage something... anything.

Hint: It's very much advisable that you teach Tidus Flee and Haste ASAP. I'm
not saying to push yourself hard right now to gain enough AP, I'm merely
stating that getting these two Abilities in early stages of the game may save
your life quite a few times.
If you keep returning from 'Salvage Ship: Underwater' to the deck of Salvage
Ship to talk to leftmost Al Bhed, who gives you 3x Potion, you can rack up to
99x Potions that way.

'Salvage Ship: Surface'
While you're in water near the ship, press Circle to dive.

'Salvage Ship: Underwater'
Keep diving.

'Underwater Ruins'
When you reach a strange room, head to what appears to be control panel and
press X. I never knew that banging on stuff would be a good thing to do...
Anyway, continue on (follow the arrow in the mini-map until you reach an X mark
indicated in the mini-map). As you enter the room, couple from Piranhas will
charge from behind you. Defeat them, then examine the 'thing' by pressing X.
Try to leave... another ambush!

SENSOR: Attacks with Nautilus Charge after backing away.
SCAN: Retreats after the column after taking damage, where it cannot be
attacked. Hits all targets with Nautilus Charge on the next turn, inflicting
great damage. Use trigger commands to stop it from unleashing Nautilus Charge.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
a) Nautilus Charge - VS all chrs - phd, requires one turn to charge
b) 'Tentacle strike' - VS one chr - phd
c) Tentacles - VS one chr - phd
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY | This battle introduces Trigger commands. Follow this strategy: Tidus
attacks, girl Uses Grenades (if she runs out, she can steal some from Tros),
heal with Potions when necessary. After you deal 350 damage to Tros, it'll get
out of range. You can still hit it with Grenades, hehe. If Tidus already has
Cheer learned, use it a few times to increase Str and Def.
You have three options now. If your health is low, use Potion to heal. If
you're quite healthy, use Trigger Command Stand By [restores 50 HP to user]. Or
otherwise press Triangle to defend. Get ready for Nautilus Charge and take the
punishment of about 170 HP (half less if you were defending). Attack Tros for
further 350 damage until it gets out of range again. This time new Trigger
Command Pincer Attack [attack an enemy from two sides] becomes available. Only
Tidus is able to use it. So? Use it and Tros can't use Nautilus Charge anymore.
Tidus attacks, girl grenadiers, but beware of Tros using stronger version of
physical attack called Tentacles, heh. It takes off about 100 HP. Wave buh-bye
to Tros, who'll disappear in a cloud of mist...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Go thru the hole Tros came in and then just keep following the girl. Game takes
over again. Hm, I should go grab a snack before we move on. After a long
sequence...

Weapons: Rod of Wisdom, Brotherhood, Seeker's Ring
Key Items: Moon Crest, Primer II
*****************************************************************************

'Besaid: Beach'
Water again. Meet the local blitz team and enjoy a bit of conversation. You'll
get 200 Gil, 2x Potion, 3x Potion and 1x Hi-Potion from them. Before you follow
their leader (who introduces himself as Wakka) off the beach, explore the area.
Pick up Moon Crest *KEY ITEM* at all costs from the chest located on the east
in a bay. Between the houses on southwest of the beach you can find a chest
with 2x Antidote.

'Besaid: Crossroads'
In this new area follow Wakka to the right. You've reached the end of the...

'Besaid: Valley'
...water? Follow the arrow. Don't forget to pick up chests (contain Phoenix
Down, Hi-Potion and 2x Antidote) you'll pass across, as this area is one-time
deal. Wakka is obviously hiding something and you'll get to learn soon what
that is... That's all? No problem!

'Besaid: Village Slope'
Simply go left.

'Besaid Village'
Yay, our first village, originally called Besaid village. Not a big one, I
might add. It has only 5 houses and one temple (which takes off 2/3 of the
village). As another rule of RPGs states: Check everything, talk with everybody
and check the shops (meanwhile ducks to avoid a Rocket Propelled Grenade).
There's a hard-to-see hidden path behind one of the houses on the left, that
leads to destroyed house with three chests. Loot them for 2x Potion, Hi-Potion
and 400 Gil. Chest in front of item shop has Phoenix Down. Now head for the
temple, which is on far north of Besaid village. Check the statues and a priest
will explain about... nope, I said no spoilers.
Return to Wakka's house and say that you want to sleep. Yawn... when you stand
up, go left, as you can't go right very far... wakey, wakey! Go to the temple
again. Tidus decides to go on a rescue mission. Welcome to the first Cloister
of Trials. While there aren't many of them, these cloisters are annoying. Let's
start. I also have pictures present to guide you thru the whole process, so
that you won't get lost ever. Under each step will be picture provided so
whenever you don't know what to do, copy/paste the link to your address bar and
voila.

*****************************************
LEVEL 1: Besaid Temple Cloister of Trials
*****************************************
LEVEL 1 PRIZE: Rod of Wisdom

STEP 1: As you enter first room, game will explain what is the purpose of
Cloister of Trials (it conveniently forgets to mention that their other purpose
is to annoy the heck out of us).
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/btemple01.jpg

STEP 2: Approach spot A marked in previous picture and touch the glyph there.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/btemple02.jpg

STEP 3: Easy, huh? Now approach spot B marked two pictures back and touch
second glyph.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/btemple03.jpg

STEP 4: Tadaah! Go down the stairs and when 'road' turns left, you'll see a
recess on the wall to the right. Examine it and remove Glyph Sphere.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/btemple04.jpg

STEP 5: With Glyph Sphere in hand go down the stairs even more. A door will be
in the way. What's this? Another recess. Put in Glyph Sphere...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/btemple05.jpg

STEP 6:... and door opens. Leave Glyph Sphere where it is and proceed down the
corridor (ignore the recess you'll see on left wall between first and second
turn). After two turns you will reach a spot with small white pillar on the
left and a bunch of wall symbols on the right. Touch the symbols.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/btemple06.jpg

STEP 7: Aren't you a nice little wall destroyer? Enter the newly opened area.
At the end is yet another recess (better get used to those). Inside is Besaid
Sphere. Remove it.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/btemple07.jpg

STEP 8: With Besaid Sphere in hand turn around and stick it into the recess
found on small pillar I mentioned before. Third wall gone... Leave the pillar
as it is. *Don't move* it yet.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/btemple08.jpg

STEP 9: Remember the door we opened with Glyph Sphere. Return there and remove
Glyph Sphere from the door.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/btemple09.jpg

STEP 10: Now I'll need you to remember the recess I mentioned in step 6. Maybe
you tried inserting Besaid Sphere into it before, but it didn't do squat,
right? That's because you need to insert Glyph Sphere into this recess like
so...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/btemple10.jpg

STEP 11: Another wall gone. Enter this small room and remove Destruction Sphere
that happily awaits to release its true potential.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/btemple11.jpg

STEP 12: Go to the room where you got Besaid Sphere (step 7!). In the recess
insert Destruction Sphere.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/btemple12.jpg

STEP 13: Unlucky me.:) And another unlucky wall gets smithened. Weee, a
treasure chest! Nail it and Rod of Wisdom (Mag+3%, Mag+5%, Sensor) is yours.
You also broke Destruction sigil! 1/6 of your work is thus done! Work for what?
It's explained in one of the sections waaaay more down in this guide.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/btemple13.jpg

STEP 14: I need to show you one more thing. If you look at this pic...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/btemple14.jpg
... there are two points of interest. You need to push small pillar onto square
shaped Spot D. If somehow you manage not to succeed into getting it there, step
onto Spot C to reset pillar's default position.

STEP 15: So stand to the right of pillar like so...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/btemple15.jpg

STEP 16:... and press left on directional buttons. Push it all the way down the
corridor until pillar is pushed onto Spot D. Pillar will now sink into the
floor. Floor will also change design into this...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/btemple16.jpg
... meaning you have successfully completed first Cloister! Congratulations.

After listening to another convo you'll be outside of temple. Head left and get
a glimpse at what Yuna can do now. Honestly, I expected a known force and not a
completely new one. Name this 'pet'. Later when the night falls, move left and
talk with Yuna. When finished and Wakka asks you a question, answer whatever
you like. Then talk to Wakka again and say you'd like to sleep.
Good morning! Wakka will hand over Brotherhood (Str+5%, 3 FS), a sword that
previously belonged to... oops, spoiler. Head for the Crusader's tent and nab
Vol. II *KEY ITEM*. Now find the girl with the dog (she's in item shop) I bet
you saw earlier and talk to her until she says 'that her dog found something'.
Go in the third house on the right of the village and 'talk' to the dog inside.
You'll get a special item, and somebody learns a new Overdrive. We're done in
this village, so get ready to depart. You gain 1x Map item automatically. Equip
function is now available in the Triangle menu.

'Besaid: Village Slope'
On your way out of the village the game will now lead you by hand by teaching
you how to best utilize your new party members.

'Besaid: Promontory'
When you reach Promontory, pray or not. It doesn't affect anything later in the
game. Proceed in arrow's direction.

'Besaid: Ancient Road'
You want some of me?

heal. Every three or so turns ???? will use Jump, which deals about 100 damage
when it connects. Otherwise ???? should go down in 7 to 9 hits.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
a) 'Move' - simply moves to another location, no harm done to your chrs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY | Characters I recommend to use are Wakka, Lulu and Tidus. Let Tidus
take care of Sinscales, but kill only two of them. If you waste all three, more
will come. Naturally concentrate on Sinscales whose wings start to flicker.
Otherwise Spines will hit for about 220 damage. Have Lulu use any offensive
magic she has on Sin, and have Wakka attack Sin as well. Once two Sinscales are
disposed of, switch Tidus out and assign Yuna as medic. Attack and attack until
Sin goes down.
Liam H. wrote to me: If you feel your guys and gals are strong enough to kill
Sinscales with one hit, keep killing them and their reinforcements. Sinscale
supply is endless. That way you can end this battle with way more AP than you
ever wished for.

SENSOR: Afflict it with darkness to make it miss.
SCAN: Absorbs HP with its Drain Touch. Inflicting darkness is the way to go.
But after two Drain Touches it will bring out the Blender, inflicting damage on
all targets.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
a) Blender - NATT VS all chrs - mgd - used every three turns
b) Drain Touch - VS one chr - phd - amount of HP deducted from attacked chr is
added to Echuilles' HP
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY | What the heck was Tidus thinking anyway? Only Tidus and somebody
else are available for this battle. Hope you haven't used all Potions yet.
Forget about Sinscales. I know they're annoying (inflict around 65 damage), but
they come in infinite numbers, so concentrate your attacks on Echuilles.
Drain Touch inflicts about 50 damage and Blender deals 120 damage to all.
Take heed: Blender is used every three turns. However, by inflicting darkness
(Dark Attack!) you can increase your odds significantly as Echuilles will have
trouble connecting Drain Touch. Also have Tidus use Cheer a few times to
increase Str and Def. I recommend counting the turns Echuilles uses Drain Touch
so you'll know when Blender will come up and use that knowledge to heal
yourself in time. Again, ignore Sinscales and concentrate on Echuilles only.
Once you rip off 2000 HP it has, it bites the water.

*****************************************************************************

As you get off the ship, go up and then left on next screen. After the movie go
out of the inn, head right, talk to Wakka. There's Vol. IV *KEY ITEM* in
'Kilika - Tavern'. Exit the tavern and then go left all the time (last house
you can enter before Kilika Woods has chest with 3x Potion; also, approach the
destroyed house with little girl in it... return to tavern and open new chest
with Ether). Leave this village until you reach Kilika Woods.

'Kilika Woods'
In this next battle you get to see how Enemy Skill works in this game. Have
Kimahri use Lancet on Ragora and he'll learn Seed Cannon, useless Ronso Rage
(this is how Enemy Skill is renamed in FFX). As soon as Kimahri learns new
Ronso Rage from specific enemy, this will fill up his Overdrive gauge to the
max immediately, so you can test out new ability.
Somewhere around now it's a good idea to have Tidus learn Haste. Explore the
forest, open chests, talk to folks roaming around and you'll find/receive:
Remedy, Hi-Potion, Luck Sphere, Scout, 2x Mana Sphere, 4x Antidote. If you
approach Lord Ochu from the left, engage in battle, let Ochu take a swing or
two at you, and then escape, a Crusader will come running and give you 3x
Phoenix Down.
Meet up with two acquaintances from Besaid village near the bridge you'll see
up ahead. Further ahead you will see an enemy which you will instantly
recognize if you're a veteran to FF - yep, it's Ochu, but not just any Ochu...

DAA: Berserkward, Darkward, Poisonward, Silenceward, Sleepward, Stoneward
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SENSOR: Vulnerable to fire.
SCAN: Its claws inflict poison. Restores lost HP by sleeping. Retaliates with
Earthquake if awakened, so watch out. Being a plant, it burns easily.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
a) Poison Claw - VS one chr - phd + Poison
b) Water - WATT VS one chr - water d.
c) 'Lord Ochu falls asleep.' - once sustaining 2500 or more damage, Ochu will
go to sleep, receiving Regen status - wake it up and it will counter with
Earthquake
d) Earthquake - GRATT & CATT VS all chrs - tears off 50% current HP - used if
awakened
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY | First boss battle where you get troubles with statuses - this time
it's Poison that'll annoy you. Get those Antidotes handy. Ochu's Poison Claw
will deal about 120 damage to single chr on top of poisoning it. It may also
cast Water for about 300 damage. Shut it up with Wakka's Silence Attack. If you
don't have that yet, casting NulTide is another solution. Also have Tidus use
Cheer a few times to increase Str and Def.
Further fighting this guy revealed a set attack pattern: Ochu will use one or
two Poison Claws, and then Water, again one or two Poison Claws, then Water.
Lulu is nearly a must in this fight. Her Fire will deal big damage to Ochu.
Tidus can also be of use by casting Haste I hope you've learned so far (you'll
need to gain 11 Sphere levels to get to Haste). Prior to the fight it is also
recommended to equip Firestrike weapons, if you have any.
I suggest not wasting Antidotes for Poison, but instead use Yuna's Esuna.
Once you knock of 2500 or more of Ochu's HP, it'll fall asleep on first turn
it'll get after that and at same time getting Regen status. Wake it up ASAP -
this will also negate Ochu's Regen. It'll counter with Earthquake, but it
cannot kill you cos it's a gravity attack based on current HP. You could also
use Valefor to strike Ochu - as Valefor is a flying bastard, Earthquake misses
(thanks to Gestahl for this). Once awakened, continue to repeat the advice I
gave above and you'll win. Also, if you've followed my tip from start of this
guide about Loner, use Slice and Dice on it for quick reduction of HP, hehe.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

After you kick his lordy ass, go right from your current position and then up
at next intersection. Also, one of two acquaintances I mentioned before will
give you Elixir; and if you talk to one of both captain Falcons... er, I mean
Crusader captains (more specifically, the one who mentions he can't believe you
wasted Ochu), you'll receive NulBlaze Shield for Tidus.

No equipment acquired!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SENSOR: Absorbs magical attacks against Geneaux.
SCAN: Absorbs magic cast against Geneaux's body. Defeat tentacles first, then
use magic attacks on the body. Tentacles have high magic defence, so physical
attacks are the way to go.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
a) 'Tentacles absorb magic!' - as long as tentacles live, ANY magic cast at
main body is useless
b) 'Tentacle strike' - VS one chr - phd
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY | Get rid of tentacles first. Why? ANY magic cast at the body will be
absorbed by tentacles. Not only do you waste a turn, you also lose valuable MP.
However, magic cast at tentacles themselves won't be absorbed. Element to use
in this fight is fire. Body is vulnerable to it, and tentacles take normal
damage from it. Tentacles deal about 100 damage on their turn. And there's two
of them, so be careful. Heal if you're at 250 HP or less!
Now what? Body is weak to magic, but resistant to physicals. Tentacles are
resistant to magic, but weak to physicals. Have Tidus use Cheer a few times to
increase Str and Def. Meanwhile attack tentacles (3-5 hits should take them
down) and then blast away at the boss with Fire magic or Firestrike weapons.
When Geneaux's HP falls is 2399 or less, it'll bust out of its shell.
Alternatively summon Valefor at the start of battle (in Overdrive, if possible)
and energize them to kingdom come (thanks to Gestahl for this).
Geneaux uses Venom, Water and Staccato in that order. So use this big tip to
plan ahead. When it breaks from shell, first attack it'll use is Venom (about
100 damage to single chr). So use Antidote or Esuna on character that's
affected. Before Geneaux's second turn comes up when it casts Water (around 90
damage), cast NulTide. You can also Silence it! On third turn get ready for
Staccato. Deals around 100 damage to all chrs. Either Defend or keep up your HP
above 200. Then the roulette repeats... of course, you shall prevail.

the spot of shining glyph, which we shall use later. H marks a recess with KS2
inserted in it.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/ktemple08.jpg

STEP 9: Take out KS2 from recess marked with H as shown above.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/ktemple09.jpg

STEP 10: Return to recess marked with C (step 3 pic) in insert KS2.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/ktemple10.jpg

STEP 11: Now get near the second pillar (marked as F in step 3 pic) with GS
atop of it. Remove the GS.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/ktemple11.jpg

STEP 12: Get moving to recess marked as H (step 8 pic) and insert GS into it.
Wall will split, allowing access to another room, but that room doesn't
interest us... yet.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/ktemple12.jpg

STEP 13: Now step on shining glyph, marked as G (step 8 pic). Pillar you saw
one room back (marked as F in step 3 pic) will be magically teleported near
your current position.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/ktemple13.jpg

STEP 14: Return to either of recesses marked as C or E (step 3 pic), doesn't
matter. But for this guide I shall use recess C. Remove KS2 from that recess.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/ktemple14.jpg

STEP 15: Now go to the pillar you teleported before by stepping on shining
glyph. Do you have KS2? If yes, insert it in recess found on that pillar.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/ktemple15.jpg

STEP 16: With KS2 inserted it's time to do a bit of pushing. Remember how you
pushed the pillar found in Besaid temple? Repeat the exercise for this one, but
you need to push the pillar onto shining glyph (mark G).
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/ktemple16.jpg

STEP 17: Part of the floor will crumble, allowing access to yet another recess.
From your current position go left, then down the stairs and to the right.
You're now near the recess, so remove KS3.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/ktemple17.jpg

STEP 18: See another set of stairs leading up not far from here? At the end is
a door with a recess on the right of it. Insert KS3 you just got into it.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/ktemple18.jpg

STEP 19: Recall the small room you were granted access back in step 12? Now
this room does interest us. Go there and remove DS.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/ktemple19.jpg

STEP 20: Now go to recess where KS3 rested before. Insert DS into it.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/ktemple20.jpg

STEP 21: Kaboom... sort of. A chest. Nail it and Red Armlet is yours. You also
just broke Destruction sigil!
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/ktemple21.jpg

STEP 22: For coup de grace go up the stairs to your left. This is where you
inserted KS3 in step 18. Now remove it and Kilika's Cloister of trials is
finished.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/ktemple22.jpg

You've reached the Antechamber! Talk to Wakka and Lulu until they start
repeating themselves. Nothing happens. Try to leave now and Yuna will appear.
You have to backtrack all the way to Kilika now. Joy, for you can test out a
new toy (if you skipped defeating Lord Ochu before, try your new toy on it).
The ship is repaired, so get on it and head out to Luca.

You'll find yourself in a cabin. Loot the chest for Hi-Potion. Find Yuna, talk
to her (stupidos, I'll take ya all on next time we meet!). Pick up Vol. V *KEY
ITEM* in ship's bridge. Now you need to find Wakka and Lulu. They're on the top
deck of the ship. Go up the stairs that lead there four times. If you want to
get one of best blitz techs for Tidus, you better save now. Go and touch the
ball you'll find on the main deck. After a so-so explanation of 'controls' try
to perform J. Shot. If you fail, don't feel bad about it. Enjoy more convo.

return to get it later in the game)
*****************************************************************************

View the movie. You've reached Luca, second largest city in Spira. You'll find
yourself on 'Luca: Nr.2 Dock'. After blahblah is over move right to 'Luca: Nr.3
dock'. Go right a bit more... Sephiroth? Naaah.:)
Time to prepare for the game. View the tutorial (or not, since it's rather
large). Yuna will burst in, saying that she saw someone you've already met
before... What? Let's go find this person. You'll be in 'Luca: Basement A'.
Follow the arrow. 'Luca: Main Gate' welcomes you. Go a bit left and down the
stairs to enter 'Luca: Basement B'. On the floor here is Vol. VI *KEY ITEM*.
There's 2x Hi-Potion chest at end of basement.
Turn back and enter 'Luca: Main Gate' again. Now let's go visit the docks.
Nr.1 Dock - 600 gil, Tidal Spear
Nr.2 Dock - 2x Phoenix Down
Return to 'Luca: Main Gate' and go in only direction you haven't gone yet. On
'Luca: Bridge' go north first. Go all the way up until you reach 'Theatre:
Reception'. There's Vol. VII *KEY ITEM* in here. Return to 'Luca: Bridge' and
go right to find 'Luca: Square'. Climb the stairs on upper right of the screen
to enter 'Luca: City Limits'. Nab 1000 Gil. Return to previous screen and enter
the tavern.
Now we have to look for somebody else. Kimahri, Lulu and Tidus will form a
search party. You need to reach 'Luca: Nr.4 Dock'. You'll have to use the left
side.
Buy Thunder Spear for Kimahri from O'aka at 'Luca: Nr.1 dock'. As you reach
'Luca: Nr.2 dock', you'll get ambushed by some weirdos. New type of enemies...
remember to follow Lulu's advice! Same thing will happen on Docks 3 and 4. Kick
last few enemies into oblivion, save. Note that this is an excellent
opportunity to stock up on Hi-Potions and X-Potions. How, you ask? Return to
Dock 3 and you'll engage in random battles against Workers. If you can Overkill
one, you'll get 2x Hi-Potion, or 2x X-Potion for rare drop. When bored, proceed
to Dock 4 and go right...

with physical attack
b) Mute Ball - CATT VS one chr - phd + Silence for one turn - used if attacked

c) Blitzball Rush - STATT VS all chrs - std - 12 hits randomly distributed

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY | Tidus will make a smartass comment... which actually pays off. As
battle starts, have Tidus use Haste on Lulu. Have Lulu cast Thunder at the
Crane three times. Meanwhile have Kimahri defend or use healing items on the
party. Do whatever you wish, just leave Oblitzerator the hell alone. Also have
Tidus use Cheer a few times to increase Str and Def.
Thundering the crane will power it up and now Oblitzerator is doomed. Have
Tidus use Trigger Command 'Use Crane' [activates crane]. Crane will move, pick
up Oblitzerator and rip off its top part, dropping it in the water, at the same
time reducing boss' HP by 93,75% of current HP. I forgot to mention that by
ripping off Oblitzerator's top part it cannot attack anymore (thanks to Gestahl
for this).
Why is this the best way? If attacked with magic, boss counters with Mute Ball
- deals about 70 damage and inflicts Silence. Blind Ball is used in case of
physical attack. Expect 90 damage and Darkness. On its regular turn it'll use
Blitzball Rush, which hits twelve times, each hit dealing around 35 damage.
Also, the lower its health, faster it'll become. And there's no Haste involved.
So it's best to go with Crane technique.
ADDITIONAL STRATEGY (submitted by Terminal Velocity):
I managed to defeat the Oblitzerator without using the crane. How so? Instead
of wasting time on using the crane with Tidus, I had him Cheer to the point
that there was no noticable increase in stats. Lulu shot off a Thunder every so
often, with the turns in which she was Silenced by the Mute Ball counter she
acted as healer.
The biggest breakthrough came when I realized that Kimahri's Lancet would be
countered by a Mute Ball, rather than a Blind Ball. This enabled me to Lancet,
get Silenced, Attack, get Blinded, then Lancet until the blindness wore off,
since Lancet is not afected by either status ailment.
The increase in Oblitzerator's Agility wasn't noticable due to Kimahri being in
Haste for more Lancet opportunities.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

What looked impossible was just possibilized! Go to your locker room, then
enter it again. Play a bit of blitzball. You obtain 1x Strength Sp. if you
manage to win this game. If you don't win, don't sweat it... After that save
when prompted. Sahagin Chiefs will litter the pool. Use a good cleansing on
them. After you kill 17 of them, reinforcements arrive.
Someone you know from before VS Vouivre. Bam! Dead Vouivre.
Wakka, Tidus and SYKFB VS Garuda. Bam! Dead Garuda (use Wakka's Dark Attack
skill for easier battle).
Wakka, Tidus and SYKFB VS ALOE (A Lot Of Enemies). Bam! Dead ALOE. But your
party didn't do it... someone else did. Surprise, surprise.

SYKFB will now start spreading rumors.:) Alright, we needed that! From No.5
Dock head to 'Luca: City Limits'. After the scene talk with Yuna and then head
off by following the arrow. *Before* you do that, tho', return to Nr.5 Dock and
check the boxes thoroughly. Between some of them is a passage that leads to two
chests containing HP Sphere and Magic Sphere.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY | An interesting battle. It's comprised of five 'slots'. From left to
right, your party fills second slot, whilst CE fills third slot. If CE manages
to push you out of first slot, you lose. If you manage to push CE out of fifth
slot, you win. You also win if you defeat CE the normal way. Let's talk
strategy now. Its normal attack deals around 300 damage to single chr. However,
if you see 'You're next!' appear on screen, prepare to heal or revive that
character on boss' next turn, as CE will unleash Fist of Fury, which deals up
to 1000 damage. If you can use Provoke already, you will never see 'You're
next!' and Fist of Fury.
Having HP at about 500 is recommended, as you won't need to revive the chr who
might get hit with normal attack. Of course, if chr is going to be hit with
Fist of Fury, let that chr take it.
'Rush attack' can't kill you, as it deals damage based on your current HP, but
it can knock you off the cliff, so either you knock CE off the cliff or defeat
it. Lastly, when CE is on its back and if it has less than 45% HP, CE can cast
Blizzard as a counter at one chr when attacked. For as long as CE is standing,
it is armored, so only Piercing weapons do full damage. For as long as it's
decked, it takes normal damage from any chr's physical attack.
As CE is vulnerable to fire, you might want to employ Lulu. Have her use Fire
(or Fira, if you've already gained at least 27 Sp. L. for her). Have Tidus cast
Haste on the party, and Slow on CE (you'll need about 35 Sp. L. for Tidus to
reach Slow, but it's worth it, believe me). Wakka will also be useful in this
battle. Have him use Dark Attack or Dark Buster (you need about 38 Sp. L.).
Auron? Power Break is very useful.
You need to deal at least 1201 damage (not necessarily in one attack) to
Chocobo Eater for it to fall over. Once you do that for first time, you could
use the free turns to Cheer and Focus. Then when it's on the ground, deal at
least 501 damage (not necessarily in one attack) to it and you'll push it back
one slot. Watch out for this: when CE is down and if it has 4500 or less HP,
it'll counter with Blizzard whenever attacked.
It's a bit funny when you manage to push CE off the cliff, but it's not worth
the effort IMO. Actually, I correct that: if you push CE off the cliff, you'll
receive 2x Lv.1 Key Sp., which I cannot seem to obtain if I kill CE the normal
way.
It's okay if you lose the battle by being pushed off the cliff, but it's not
okay if you lose the battle by having all of the party KO-ed. It'll be Game
Over for you, so careful.
* - You're awarded Lv.1 Key Sp. only if you manage to push CE off the cliff.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you lose by accident, you'll continue on 'Highroad: Oldroad, South'.
You get a free ride if you won. Ride off into the sunset with Billy the Kid on
the back...

'Highroad: Newroad, South'
Nothing at all. Just go forward.

'Highroad: Newroad, North'
Don't run all the time. Go slower and look for small yellow stripes on the
ground - these are chocobo feathers. There's aren't many, but they do lead to
some treasures. There's one in this part - it leads to Heat Lance. Back on the
road look for Vol. IX *KEY ITEM* lying on the road.

'Highroad: North End'
You've reached the end of Highroad. Kick the chest for 2x Hi-Potion. Take a
right to enter Oldroad...

'Highroad: Oldroad, North'
Look carefully for feather - it leads to Thunder Blade and Scout.

'Highroad: Oldroad, South'
Feather here leads to Fortune Sphere. At the end of Oldroad you'll find a chest
with Mars Crest *KEY ITEM*.
Return all the way back to the last crossroads. Dismount Chocobo as you can't
take it any further. Laugh at Dona's incompetence (heh, serves you right, you
witch). Approach the carriage until it goes away. You can talk to Clasko here
and he'll wonder where Elma and Lucile are. You'll be given the option of
helping him look for them (carriage led by Gatta and Luzzu must be gone) or
letting it be. I don't know yet what kind (if any at all) of consequences it
might have to help Clasko out. Talk with everybody and then try going north (as
the screen shifts, talk with person in lower left corner and decide how much
you'd like to donate, if anything at all - depending on donation, you'll get an
item (for 100 gil Scout, for 1000 Ice Lance and for 10000 Moon Ring). You won't
be able to go thru as well. As you try to go back, someone will make the guards
let you thru.

QUICK TIP: If haven't done so already, have Lulu learn her Lv2 element spells:
Fira, Blizzara, Thundara and Watera.
QUICK TIP: You should train up Yuna until she learns Cura.

'Mushroom Rock'
On this road your path further north will be blocked by Clasko guy who insists
it's too dangerous to go forward. Yeah right. Talking with people will nab you:
Remedy, Ether, Hi-Potion, 2x Phoenix Down. Backtrack a bit to where you entered
Mushroom Rock - there will be a guy who hands over Tough Bangle (HP+20%, 1 FS).
After all this you'll need to take the left path.

'Mushroom Rock: Valley'
Person here will give you Hi-Potion. Then use the platform. After a lot of zig-
zaging (during your trip thru here find/receive: 10x Potion, 1000 Gil,
Remedy, Hi-Potion). You'll reach next platform.

'Mushroom Rock: Precipice'
In new area find your way around. Find/receive: X-Potion, Serene Armlet, 400
Gil. Taking a big curve you'll see on the map leads to Vol. X *KEY ITEM*.
Take another platform up. You'll get Mega-Potion from guy closest to mechanical
lift. Go past the save point for a bit of story. Then use the lift.

'Mushroom Rock: Plateau'
Nothing of interest. Proceed right.

'Mushroom Rock: Ridge'
Talk to Gatta and choose whatever you wish. Talk to him again, again choose
whatever you wish. You'll meet an old friend of Auron's. When done chatting,
save. Loot two chests here for Serene Bracer and Mega-Potion. Look for the
person on extreme right and say 'Yes'.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
a) 'The arms regenerated!' - after few turns in which Gui is without its arms
pass, they will regenerate
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY | Looks intimidating, but fear not! Another boss with set patterns of
moves, hehe. Gui will alternate between 'Punch' (deals about 600 damage) and
Demi. Head will go like this: Thunder (deals about 180 damage), 'The head is
moving suspiciously!' and Venom (500 damage, unblockable, Poison).
Anytime when head starts to move, hit it with anything that flies at a
distance, ie Wakka's ball or Lulu's magic. Note that Auron's Dragon Fang will
not stop the head. Strange indeed (thanks to Gestahl for this). Doing this will
forfeit it's next turn. Otherwise you'll get hit by Venom, and damage dealt
can't be halved in any way. Hitting the head when it's twitching will reset
head's pattern to Thunder on next turn. Get rid of the head completely to stop
the annoying Venom.
Gui hits hard, so you should have your HP above 1000. Yuna's Cura will help you
much - I hope you listened to my advice and had her learn it? And Gui is immune
to Slow and Delay skills.
As the battle starts, cast Haste at everyone that'll participate - I'd
recommend Tidus, Yuna and Lulu. Tidus will provide Haste for members who might
get knocked out. Yuna will heal members or revive them. Meanwhile Lulu will
barrage Gui with spells.
Take note that physically attacking Gui at any time with at least one arm still
alive will not be a good idea - arm/s will move in the way and shield Gui.
Damage dealt will be done to Gui, but it won't be much. So get rid of arms
first - either by magic or by using piercing weapons.
BIG BREAKTHRU: Arms are susceptible to Armor Break! What does that mean? Have
Auron use Armor Break on each Arm once (hopefully he won't kill them) and there
you have it - you can now concentrate your attacks on main body without those
annoying Arms reducing the damage. Yes, they will still move in the way to
shield the body, but they *will not* reduce the damage as we've Armor Break-ed
them. Just careful not to kill the arms, heh. You've got the tips, now go and
win.

I thought Crusaders will do all the job, not I! Oh well, after this movie is
over, you'll understand why it had to be you that did the dirty job...

a) 'The arms regenerated!' - after few turns in which Gui is without its arms

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY | Same boss as before, only with lesser stats. Gui will alternate
between 'Punch' (deals about 100 damage) and Demi. Head will go like this:
Thunder (deals about 90 damage), 'The head is moving suspiciously!' and Venom
(200 damage, unblockable, Poison).
Anytime when head starts to move, hit it with ????'s magic. Doing this will
forfeit it's next turn, which would be Venom and damage dealt can't be halved
in any way. Gui doesn't hit hard anymore. ????'s healing magic will take care
of tight situations.
Strategy is pretty much the same as in previous fight, only things different
are members you're using and boss' stats.
Take note that physically attacking Gui at any time with at least one arm still
alive will not be a good idea - arm/s will move in the way and shield Gui.

When summing everything up, this battle isn't hard at all, esp of certain chr's
stats. So what else remains? Winning!

straight away as it has Stoneproof!), 2x Phoenix Down, Bright Bangle, Ether,
Hi-Potion, Mega-Potion, Variable Steel. Be careful of Basilisks found in this
area. They can petrify your chrs. Check behind stone pillars - one of them
hides Vol. XI *KEY ITEM*. Path is pretty straightforward. At the end go right
and you will reach another temple, another Cloister and another... well, I'm
sure you know what you get at the end, so I won't write that down.

DJS - Djose Sphere
GS - Glyph Sphere
DS - Destruction Sphere

STEP 1: In this pic a part of first room is shown. R1 marks a recess in which
DJS1 is inserted. Remove it and stick it in left recess found on the doors
(marked with X).
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/dtemple01.jpg

STEP 2: Repeat the exercise. Remove DJS1 inserted in R2 recess and stick it in
other recess found on the doors (again marked with X). Doors will disengage the
lock and you're now able to go thru.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/dtemple02.jpg

STEP 3: Lots of spheres again. R3 is a recess with DJS3 inside. R4 has DJS4. P1
is a pillar atop which DJS5 rests.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/dtemple03.jpg

STEP 4: On this pic Tidus is standing between two recesses. Left one is R5,
right one R6. Strange contraption on the ceiling (marked with CON) is
activated...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/dtemple04.jpg

STEP 5:... by removing DJS3 from R3 and inserting it into R5. Similarly remove
DJS4 from R4 and insert it into R6. Contraption is activated!
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/dtemple05.jpg

STEP 6: For what purpose? For that stand on the left of pillar (marked as P1)
and push it to the right all the way you can. Contraption will electrify DJS5.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/dtemple06.jpg

STEP 7: At the opposite end of contraption is shining glyph. Step on it.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/dtemple07.jpg

STEP 8: Pillar (P1) will return to original position with charged DJS5 atop.
Remove DJS5 and insert it into R4. Doing this will remove the door to the left,
allowing access in further depths of Djose temple.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/dtemple08.jpg

STEP 9: Electrifying! To get across, do the following: Remove DJS3 from R5 and
insert it in either one of recesses found on top of pillar (P1). Remove DJS4
from R6 and insert it in other recess found on pillar (P1). After all of this
pillar should be in such position...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/dtemple09.jpg

STEP 10: Stand below it and push it up until it falls in the chasm. Magically
it'll float back up... (red X shows position of pillar, which is otherwise not
to be seen in this pic)
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/dtemple10.jpg

STEP 11: Approach the chasm and Tidus will jump across. E1 marks a device near
which you need to press X in order to activate it (you'll find a bunch of them
later). So do that.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/dtemple11.jpg

STEP 12: After this jump back across. Step on shining glyph again (look at step
7 pic if you forgot its location). Pillar (P1) returns to its position. Remove
DJS3 from atop of it and insert it into R1 (step 1 pic!). DJS4, when removed
from pillar, must be inserted into R2 (step 2 pic!). On this pic you see Tidus
standing in corridor with two white lines (L1 and L2), one on each side. This
means you have successfully completed this exercise.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/dtemple12.jpg

STEP 13: Only one part of picture remains to be completed. Remove charged DJS5
from R4...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/dtemple13.jpg

STEP 14:... and relocate it to R3. Pillar will disappear and will instead be
replaced by a lift.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/dtemple14.jpg

STEP 15: What's that shining on the wall? Near shining glyph you will notice an
insignia that glows every so often. Examine it and touch the glyph.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/dtemple15.jpg

STEP 16: Weeee. Destruction Sphere!
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/dtemple16.jpg

STEP 17: Once you have it, board the lift shown on step 14 pic and up you go.
On this pic you have E2, E3, E4, E5 and E6 (E2 and E6 I wasn't able to capture
onto pics... they are located behind corners - E2 on left, and E6 on right).
Approach all five of them and press X to activate them. Once they shoot down,
final steps will become exposed and another pillar shall also arise (marked as
P2).
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/dtemple17.jpg

STEP 18: Approach this second pillar and make it happy with Destruction Sphere.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/dtemple18.jpg

STEP 19: Where wall previously existed, there's now a chest with Magic Sphere.
Congrats, for you just broke another Destruction sigil...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/dtemple19.jpg
... now all that is left is ascending the stairs to your left.

You've reached the Antechamber. Talk to your members until they repeat
themselves. Try to exit and Yuna pops out. Pick another name, then go to sleep.
When you control Tidus again, head back to the shop. There's a chest with
Switch Hitter. Back outside talk to everybody. Now enter the temple and enter
leftmost room. Yuna is knocked out on the bed. Talking to the person next to
her will prompt Yuna to wake up. Then head back to Djose Highroad. This time
people on Pilgrimage Road will hand over items if you stick 'em up... I mean
talk to them: Halberd, 2x Hi-Potion, 10x Potion. If you return all the way back
to screen 'Mushroom Rock: Aftermath', you'll find a destroyed pieces of some
machine in lower left of that screen. Climb the boxes near it and walk to the
next screen. Chest you'll encounter contains 4x Soft.

SCAN: After rising, it releases Depth Charges, inflicting darkness and damage
on Tidus and Wakka. Hurt it as much as you can to bring it back down.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
a) Aqua Shooter - WATT VS one chr - water mgd
b) 'Readying Depth Charges' - signifies charge turn for 'Depth Charges'
c) Depth Charges - STATT VS all chrs - std + Darkness (inflicted for three
chr's turns)
d) 'The Extractor comes back down!' - after dealing 500 damage to Extractor
during its raised state, it'll come back down
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY | Yay? An underwater battle again with only two characters. One of
priorities you have to give most importance to is keeping your HP at about 500
or higher. Why? Aqua Shooter deals around 200 damage. Depth Charges deal about
350 damage to each character, on top of it inflicting Darkness.
As the battle starts, have Tidus cast Haste on both himself and Wakka. Slow
works on boss, as do Delay skills! Extractor will use two turns for Aqua
Shooter. On third turn it'll rise, and on fourth turn it'll release Depth
Charges. During boss' third and fourth turn try your hardest to inflict at
least 500 damage to boss, as you'll bring it back down, thus disabling its
chance to use Depth Charges and resetting its attack pattern to Aqua Shooter,
Aqua Shooter, 'Readying Depth Charges', etc...
If somehow you're too late or don't deal enough damage, use Eye Drops to heal
Darkness you might've been inflicted with. Otherwise use Hi-Potions you might
have left. By Hasting your chrs and Slowing the boss (at least Haste is
recommended to have already) your odds can increase greatly in this battle.
Remember to attack as much as you can during its raised state and you will win
easily.
ADDITIONAL STRATEGY:
See two Aqua Shooters and allow the boss to rise - naturally, don't forget to
hit the boss. Just before Extractor is about to use Depth Charges, have Tidus
use Provoke on Extractor. It'll come back down and two messages will pop up.
'The Extractor is provoked!' and 'Aqua Shooter damage increases!' Don't be
alarmed at the latter message, this is actually better that getting hit with
Depth Charges. AS' damage increases only by 50% anyway, so why worry? Provoked
Extractor will use two powered-up AS. After it has done so, first turn
Extractor gets after that, two new messages appear. 'The Extractor cools down'
and 'Aqua Shooter damage decreases'. Cool! From now on you'll see regular
pattern: AS, AS, rise, Depth Charges, repeat. Just remember to use Provoke
before Depth Charges phase and you win.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

'Moonflow: North Wharf'
Talk to everybody and head left. On this screen pick up Vol. XII *KEY ITEM* -
it's a bit hard to see. Left. Open the chest for Ether. Left again.

'Moonflow: North Bank'
Recognize this person? I bet you know what follows. Yep, a tutor battle. Open
the chest for 4x Antidote. Proceed north. I've received an excellent tip from
GamerZombie666 regarding Rikku. Once you regain her back when crossing a large
body of water on a certain animal, you'll see that she starts very close to
Reflect on the standard SG - there's only a matter of Lv.2 Lock in the way.
First Lv.2 Key Sp. you can obtain after getting Rikku permanently is after
beating Spherimorph boss in Macalania woods. So save Rikku's SLVL until after
beating boss mentioned, then use her SLVL to move over SG toward Reflect node,
use newly gained LV.2 Key Sp. to remove Lv.2 Lock and Reflect is yours. It will
prove mightily useful for later battles.

Talk to your members, then listen to more convo.
Exit the manor, and go a bit down. Yuna is all mine, you know! Head for the
Farplane. On screen 'Road to Farplane' there's a chest with 8x Lightning
Marble. Go north. Chat, chat again, the go thru the portal. Talk to Wakka, then
Lulu, then Yuna. At this point Brotherhood weapon for Tidus is upgraded with
following abilities: Str+5%, Str+10%, Waterstrike, Sensor.
Exit the Farplane and approach the manor. Chat. Go down the slope and talk to
Lulu again and again (or if Rikku's affection for Tidus is higher, you'll have
a chat with Rikku). Then try to exit Guadosalam in direction of Thunder Plains.
Go back to front of the manor. Finally you can leave.

can also return to the Farplane, where chest has appeared containing Venus
Crest *KEY ITEM*.

'Thunder Plains: South'
Don't worry if lightning strikes you. It doesn't cause any damage to you.
You will see a bunch of strange stones that glow with a picture of Cactuar.
Press *Square* button in front of three such stones (when they're glowing) to
be able to encounter Qactuars. If Wakka's Acc and Str are high enough, he will
hit and kill one with ease. Steal few Chocobo Feathers from them. They'll be
useful later. I also recommend trying to dodge 20 lightning bolts. Once you do
this, there will be a chest containing 2x MP Sphere in front of Rin's Agency
which is located just further ahead. Chests in this area on the left contain:
2x Phoenix Down, 5000 gil and 2x Hi-Potion. On the right side you'll find a
chest with Water Ball (this one is hidden in an 'alcove' you'll see in
minimap). You must go all the way north until a cutscene...

'Thunder Plains: Agency Front'
Talk to Rikku.;) Enter the Agency. Talk to everybody (do NOT follow Yuna yet!)
and Rin will show up eventually. Pick the first option and you'll receive Vol.
XIV *KEY ITEM*. Follow Yuna. After the scene talk to Rikku. There's also a book
with a hint about Cactuar stones you saw outside, which is located on the
counter between save sphere and Mifurey (Rin's attendant in this Agency).
Outside pick up Yellow Shield, then proceed north.

'Thunder Plains: North'
Half more way to go. There're are chests with Ether, 2000 gil, X-Potion and
Remedy scattered over north Thunder Plains. Then proceed north even more.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY | Challenging boss indeed, but not hard to defeat. Characters to be
brought into this fight are Tidus, Yuna and Lulu (hopefully you've learned her
Lv2 spells already).
First cast Haste on all three so you'll get more turns in. Have Yuna defend for
the time being. Have Lulu use Focus a few times to increase Mag and Mdef. It's
also recommended to bring in Auron for one turn and use Power Break on
Spherimorph - doing this will halve the damage Spherimorph is doing with Press
- instead of 50% it'll rip off 25% current HP. At any time Spherimorph is weak
to one element, and absorbs other three elements. Example: Boss is weak to
fire, but absorbs other three.
Now when Tidus is done inflicting Haste, have him attack Spherimorph with a
physical attack (make sure he doesn't have a weapon with element attack
equipped) and take note with which spell boss will counter. If it's Fire / Ice,
this means that boss is vulnerable to ice / fire element. If it's Water /
Thunder, this means that boss is weak to lightning / water.
Okay! Now that you've seen what magic boss has used as a counter, have Lulu
cast the correct countermeasure - so if boss used Fire, have Lulu use Blizzard.
Boss will use Elemental Shift - its weaknesses will change. I tried figuring
out if it has a certain pattern which dictates what will be its next elemental
weakness, but it turned out that it's completely random. One last note:
Spherimorph *doesn't* always start with Fire spells. First spell it'll use
against you is completely random.
Again have Tidus attack Spherimorph, memorising which spell it'll use. Then
have Lulu use the right counterpart. Rinse and repeat. Should somehow your HP
get low... that's why Yuna is here for.
Let's assume Spherimorph is currently using Fire. Here's description on how it
will act (re-apply for other element magic):
- if attacked with fire, water or lightning based attacks (these are all
elements boss currently absorbs), boss'll counter with that Fire spell cast at
whole party; it'll also counter like that if non-element magic (healing, for
example) is used on it
- if attacked with physical, boss counters with Fire cast at the attacker
- on boss' turn, it'll use 'Slam', which deals about 200 damage, or Press
Note: Funnily this boss can be Zombied. Too bad you don't have that ability by
now... unless you were really leveling up.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You'll get Jecht's Sphere *KEY ITEM*.

'Macalania Woods: Lake Road'
Back on track. Save. Then proceed north as usual. Check your equipment and see
if you have weapons with Lightningstrike ability for Wakka, Auron and Tidus. If
not, I suggest returning to Thunder Plains and steal some items that allow you
to customize weapons with Lightningstrike.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY | Although by taking a look at boss' HP it may seem a hard boss, it's
not. Use Wakka, Auron and Tidus. Got lightning based weapons in your stock?
Good, unload at the boss until it bites the dust. If you don't have these, it's
quite alright, but the battle will take longer.
Why is this better strategy than getting rid of Negator?
- boss counters almost every attack with Assault, which deals about 800 damage
to attacker
- on each fourth turn it'll use Mana Beam, which deals about 1300 damage to all
chrs (you can check how many turns left by blinking lights on boss' turret gun)
- I'd rather get hit by Gatling Gun (with Negator around), which hits 8 times,
but it deals less damage than single Assault (each hit scores for about 50
damage)
- plus boss doesn't counter at all with Negator around
Lastly, use Hi-Potions to heal yourself when need be.
ADDITIONAL STRATEGY: Start battle with Tidus, Wakka and Auron. Have Wakka
attack Negator until it's killed. For that time being have Tidus and Auron
attack Crawler or heal if wounds get severe (if you wish, use Tidus' Cheer to
increase Str and Def). Once Negator is down, swap Wakka for Lulu and Auron for
Yuna. Now Crawler starts countdown to Mana Beam and will *not* attack for three
turns. Mana Beam is released on fourth turn. Tidus now casts Haste at all
three, and (if possible) Slow at Crawler. As Scan indicates, Crawler spits out
another Negator once Crawler has been hit with four magic attacks. All three of
your chrs are now getting two turns in a row before Crawler gets one (or even
up to four turns per one Crawler's in case you Slow-ed it down). Your main goal
here is to have Lulu throw four magic attacks at Crawler as quickly as she can.
Heal her each time she will get countered by Assault. It's also a good thing to
cast Yuna's protective spells on the party, if she has learned them already.
Once that is accomplished, another Negator pops out. Swap to your original
team: Lulu and Yuna out, Auron and Wakka in. Crawler will continue countdown to
Mana Beam, but when it reaches the time to be released, nothing will happen cos
of Negator around.:) Again have Wakka attack Negator until it's down, Auron and
Tidus attack Crawler... etc etc. Simply rinse and repeat and you will win with
no difficulties. If Rikku had stolen any elemental-based items so far, you can
have her use them on Crawler - highly recommended are Electro Marbles.
BIG TIP: If Rikku got lucky and she stole Silver Hourglass from one of these
enemies: Lamashtu or Vouivre, have her use it on Crawler. Slow effect works
100% of the time, unless the fiend is immune to it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY | First things first! Use Tidus, Yuna and *Rikku*. As battle starts,
Guado Guardians will cast Protect on themselves and S. will Shell himself. Have
Yuna use Trigger Command Talk (talk to enemy). Doing this will increase her
Magic Def for 10 points (same for Wakka, but I don't find him useful for this
fight). Choosing Talk for Tidus will increase his Str for 10 points. Even if
KO-ed, stat increases remain in effect for duration of this battle. As usual
cast Haste on all three chrs. Meanwhile have Rikku Steal from Guado Guardians
to stop them using Auto-Potion.;) Once she stole from each one once, swap her
for Lulu (Haste her as well) and use Lulu's Focus a few times.
GG are susceptible to Armor Break. But *even* if Auron uses Armor Break on each
once, there still won't be any efficient increase in damage you do.
Now one thing to memorize is that S. uses element magic in certain order,
starting with ice. It goes like this: ice, lightning, water, fire. So each turn
before S. gets to act, have Yuna cast respective NulElement on party, ie if S.
is about to use Fira, cast NulBlaze. Otherwise S.'s spells deal around 600
damage a pop.
Beware of Guado G.'s Shremedy - it inflicts Confusion. Either hit Confused chr
or use Remedy on it. On turns Yuna gets to 'waste' have her cast Shell on your
members if you have it by now. Use magic attacks on Guado G. until they're
gone. Next use physicals against S. until his HP fall below 3000, at which
point reinforcements will arrive.
I hope you have lots of Phoenix Downs. Don't bother casting Haste over chr
you'll revive as they may just get knocked out again. Instead keep attacking
S.'s new ally. Her Pain carries Death, but it cannot bypass Deathproof (found
out with help of AR2, don't worry about it). If her Overdrive gets full, summon
an aeon to shield yourself from Oblivion, which deals massive damage.
Personal observation: I've seen some strategies about summoning new Aeon and
using Heavenly Strike in order to delay next turn of this enemy. This is a bad
suggestion. Why? First it delays new aeon's next turn a bit (you know, being a
special attack) and second, this enemy is immune to Delay skills.
Take a look. She mostly uses Boost. Now what does Boost do if you choose that
command for your aeons? That's right, damage done to them is greater. Same
applies here. Remember to summon an aeon if Overdrive is imminent! Tidus' Slice
& Dice might come in handy.
Once she is disposed of, S. steps back into the fray, mightily improved. His HP
is restored and he now casts Multi version spells that hit two chrs at once.
Plus they're almost three times stronger. If only one is alive, that chr will
get double dose. But again he goes in known order of ice, lightning, water and
fire - so Yuna again to the rescue. He will start with whatever element was
last used before he summoned. Recast Haste on Yuna is she's too slow to keep up
with S. He also falls easily to Slow and is susceptible to Magic Break. With
no-one to shield him now he bites the dust.

STEP 1: Wow... it's a long way across. And a long exercise awaits you, too.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/mtemple01.jpg

STEP 2: Stop for a while at this screen. I need to explain few thingies. R1 is
a recess with MS1. R2 is recess with MS2. P1 is pillar with one recess atop of
it. R3 marks a recess with GS. SG1 marks shining glyph we'll use few times.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/mtemple02.jpg

STEP 3: See pillar (P1)...?
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/mtemple03.jpg
Stand on its left and push it into an iceberg (marked with IC1). After this
push, stand below pillar and push it up into another iceberg (IC2). Pillar will
slide down the slope past R1.

STEP 4: Picture should look like this now, if you successfully got rid of both
icebergs.

STEP 5: Let's beging inputting those spheres. First remove GS from R3.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/mtemple05.jpg

STEP 6: Go past R1 down the icy slope. You'll reach lowest level of this
Cloister and bump into pillar (P1), but that doesn't interest us yet. Go as far
left as you can and insert GS into far-left recess found on wall. You'll know
you hit the right one if a portion of the floor rises on upper level.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/mtemple06.jpg

STEP 7: Back on middle level approach newly discovered recess. Surprise,
surprise. MS3... remove it.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/mtemple07.jpg

STEP 8: Back on lower level you may have noticed two bottom parts of two of
three huge pillars that supported ice path which crumbled away once you tried
to exit the temple after you defeated last boss. One is very close to recess
into which you inserted GS and the other is all way to the right. Left huge-
pillar-bottom part has a recess. Into this recess insert MS3. One third of path
is created.

STEP 11: After MS2 is in, push this pillar to the right. It'll slide right
under huge-pillar-bottom part and create second third of path. It must look
like this...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/mtemple11.jpg

STEP 12: Back on middle level remove MS1 from R1.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/mtemple12.jpg

STEP 13: Finally insert MS1 into R3. Path complete!
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/mtemple13.jpg

STEP 14: Once you're back to the top... hm, another shining glyph? What does it
do? Step on it.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/mtemple14.jpg

STEP 15: Oooops. But it is necessary if you want to break Destruction sigil for
this temple. *Push* pillar (P1) that materialized near you down the slope. Do
not remove MS2 from the pillar! Pillar'll be shot across into some light
beam...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/mtemple15.jpg

STEP 16:... see the light? MS2 became DS. Step on SG (shining glyph, if you
forgot).
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/mtemple16.jpg

STEP 17: At same level remove MS1 from R3.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/mtemple17.jpg

STEP 18: Insert MS1 into R1 to create a path to lower level.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/mtemple18.jpg

STEP 19: Remove DS from pillar (P1) that teleported to its default position.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/mtemple19.jpg

STEP 20: Go down onto lower level (we recreated the path). I'm sure you've
noticed another recess to the right of recess we fed earlier with GS. This
recess can be fed with DS...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/mtemple20.jpg

STEP 21: A part of floor will crumble away, revealing chest with Luck Sphere.
You also broke Destruction sigil for this temple as well.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/mtemple21.jpg

STEP 22: Remove DS from recess you put it into.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/mtemple22.jpg

STEP 23: Return DS onto its original position on pillar (P1).
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/mtemple23.jpg

STEP 24: Retrieve MS1 from R1...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/mtemple24.jpg

STEP 25:... and put it into R2.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/mtemple25.jpg

STEP 26: Return to top floor and step on this shining glyph again.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/mtemple26.jpg

STEP 27: Familiar? As before do not remove DS! Push pillar down the slope.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/mtemple27.jpg

STEP 28: Go down the slope on middle level and approach SG. Also step on it. DS
changed back into MS2.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/mtemple28.jpg

STEP 29: Again stand on pillar's left and push it to the right.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/mtemple29.jpg

STEP 30: Remove MS1 from R2.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/mtemple30.jpg

STEP 31: Insert MS1 into R1.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/mtemple31.jpg

STEP 32: Now stand below pillar and push it up, so that is slides to lower
level.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/mtemple32.jpg

STEP 33: Go after the pillar to lower level. Push it to the right, just like
before. Second third of path is again created.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/mtemple33.jpg

STEP 34: One last touch... remove MS1 from R1.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/mtemple34.jpg

STEP 35: Insert MS1 into R3...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/mtemple35.jpg
... and you're home free. Just be careful that you don't step on shining glyph
found on upper level, otherwise you'll have to do some stuff again! Proceed
north to exit this Cloister.

STRATEGY | Ouch. Wendigo's Punch under Berserk deals about 2500 damage.
Otherwise you're looking at around 1800 damage when not under Berserk. Yet
again you have annoying Guado G. to deal with. First have Rikku steal from them
so they can't use Auto-Potion anymore. Then have Tidus cast Haste on himself,
Wakka and Yuna. When this is done, use Wakka's Dark Attack (or Buster, if
you're that far) on Wendigo to blind it, thus decreasing its chances to hit
you. Meanwhile have Yuna cast Protect on Tidus (switch him out and bring Auron
in), then Wakka, then Auron. On Yuna's next turn switch her out and bring Tidus
in. Now lastly cast Haste on Auron and you're set.
With Auron Power Break Wendigo. Wakka should keep using Dark Attack or Buster.
Use Tidus to dispose of Guado G. You can also Threaten Wendigo, freezing it up
and forfeiting its next turn.
Once those two are gone, they'll cast Protect and Shell on Wendigo. Just
beautiful. If Yuna is far enough already to use Dispel, then by all means use
it. Or call Ixion and use his Aerospark which carries Dispel effect. Otherwise
battle is still easy, it'll just take longer.
Finally heal that Berserk on Wendigo if it's still affected. Now pay attention.
Keep attacking with Tidus, Auron and Wakka (have the latter use Sleep Attack -
Buster!) - but as soon as Wendigo puts up its hands - stop. Bring in Lulu and
shell Wendigo to oblivion with her spells. You might also consider bringing in
Rikku and have her Use attack items in your inventory.
Wendigo will alternate between three turns of 'Ready punch' and 'Punch'.
That's all you need to know to kick its ass.

'Oasis'
Yay. Dessert! Not a typo.:) Get out of water, then go back in the water. Get a
chest with 4x Remedy. If you missed Primer I at start of game, you can now find
it to the right of the save sphere in the shades. Let's go for a stroll in
desert. In first battle two others join you. Go up a bit and find third one.
Near is chest with 8x Al-Bhed Potion. Also, if you missed getting Primer III
before, nail it now. It is under the same tent where you found third one.

'Sanubia Desert: East'
On this screen first go right to find fourth one - near this spot you may nail
Primer V, but only if you missed getting it earlier in the game. Then go in
other direction to find fifth one. Nab two chests for 8x Al-Bhed Potion and 2x
Ether. Who's leading the way anyway? A tutor battle will issue introducing how
Rikku can dispose of robotic enemies fast. At intersection leading on the left
is chest with 4x Hi-Potion. To the right of this chest you can nail Primer XIV,
but only if you missed getting it earlier in the game. Follow Rikku into next
section of desert...

'Sanubia Desert: Central'
Kick the chests for: 4x Hi-Potion, 8x Al-Bhed Potion, 2x Mega-Potion and 2x X-
Potion. Save at save sphere found in this part of desert. Further ahead you
will see a sign saying 'This way to Home.'. Before it is Vol. XVIII *KEY ITEM*.
Backtrack to save sphere and go left. You'll see a lot of ruins. Here you can
find Vol. XVII *KEY ITEM* (inside one of ruined houses) as well as few more
chests with Elixir, Lv.2 Key Sp., 10000 Gil. Continue on to last part of
desert.

'Sanubia Desert: West'
There's a few nice goodies here, but you'll need to defeat their guardians in
sandtraps. Doing this yields 2x Teleport Sphere, 3x Megalixir. In 'regular
chests' you'll find 8x Hi-Potion, Mercury Crest *KEY ITEM*, 3x Mega-Potion, 2x
X-Potion. Forget about part of desert with sandstorms - you can't do anything
about it.

There's Vol. XIX *KEY ITEM* on left of this screen. Check one of dead bodies
for 2x Hi-Potion.

'Home: Entrance'
Win a battle. Then proceed right.

'Home: Main Corridor'
Careful now! First win a battle. Then go down the stairs and when screen
shifts, examine the chest under stream of smoke to your immediate left. You'll
receive 4x Al Bhed Potion. Go back up the stairs you just descended and enter
first door on the left.

'Home: Living Quarters'
Win a battle. Examine the left chest and pick...
First row: Bomb, Elixir, Hi-Potion
Second row: Mega-Potion, Soft, Chimera
Third row: Potion, Remedy, Evil Eye
As you can see, it's a bad thing if you choose either: first choice in first
row, third choice in second row, or third choice in third row. Chest will open,
but you'll have to defeat the respective fiend. The *best* choice is second
choice in first row - you get 1x Elixir.
Then examine right chest. First pick second option in third row, then third
option in second row, then second option in second row. You'll get Friend
Sphere.
There's also Vol. XX *KEY ITEM* to the right of this chest (hard to see, keep
mashing X to pick it up). Exit the room, go down the stairs and go forward. In
chest you'll find 6x Al-Bhed Potion. Backtrack a little and head right.
There's Vol. XXI *KEY ITEM* at the end of this hallway. Then enter door on the
right.

'Home: Living Quarters'
Win a battle. Examine the left chest (other hardly visible). A password, eh.
First number is sth *plus* sth.
Second is sth *minus* sth.
Third is sth *times* sth.
Last is sth *plus* sth.
You'll get Special Sphere. Examine the chest on right of the screen. 'Who wants
to be a gillionare?' Pick third choice, then fourth, then second, then first.
Skill Sphere is yours! Exit this room and go in only direction you haven't
checked yet. Enter door on your left. Win another battle. What the...???
Downstairs there are two chests with Lv.4 Key Sp. and Lv.2 Key Sp. Enter the
door.

'Home: Environment Controls'
After the scene loot the chest for 10000 Gil and then go thru the exit.

'Home: Airship Dock'
Go the only way available.

SENSOR: Releases Poison Breath after inhaling.
SCAN: High magic defence. No elemental weaknesses. Exhales Poison Breath if hit
repeatedly by melee attacks. Ask Cid to move the airship away and he'll launch
a volley of Guided Missiles for you.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
a) Poison Breath - NATT VS all chrs - mgd + Poison - requires one turn to
charge
b) 'Swipe' - VS one chr - phd
c) Photon Spray - NATT VS all chrs - mgd - deals 8 hits between random targets
- used only if ship is far away from Evrae
d) 'Inhale' - signifies charge turn for Poison Breath
e) Haste - CATT on oneself - once Evrae is down to about 40% health, it'll use
Haste on itself - used as counterattack
f) Stone Gaze - VS one chr - inflicts Petrify and Slow (Slow is inflicted
regardless of protections!) - used after Evrae suffers from certain attack
combos (fully explained in strategy)
g) Swooping Scythe - (CATT sometimes) VS all chrs - phd - used if ship is far
away *and* if Evrae is low on HP
h) 'Out of breath range.' - signifies you've successfully evaded Evrae's Poison
Breath
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY | Its 'Swipe' will strike for roughly 1200 damage. Photon Spray deals
100 damage per hit. Poison Breath strikes for 1300 damage to all chrs and
inflicts Poison.
If ship is close to Evrae, it'll attack like this - 'Swipe', 'Swipe', 'Inhale',
Poison Breath, repeat. Never use Delay skills on it. Although they work, Evrae
counters with Haste on itself (after three Delay Attacks - after one Delay
Buster). However, if you can pull off Delay Attack-Buster with Tidus before
Evrae will get a turn in even when hasted, then by all means use only Delay
skills on it to kill it without seeing a single attack once.
If ship is far away from Evrae, it'll use only Photon Spray. Then later when
it's low on HP (that means it is under 10665 HP and hit Haste phase), it'll be
using Swooping Scythe for about 700 damage to everyone (if ship is far away and
Evrae's turn is not up yet, and you attack it with say Fira, Evrae will
*counter* by using Swooping Scythe... in fact, everything you try to use on
Evrae will prompt it to counter).
Last obstacle fell! I figured out when to expect Stone Gaze move! Hahah,
there's not a secret I cannot uncover *ego-talk*. Shhhh! Anyway, you know
already of Evrae's attack pattern if close to it. But it may happen that
instead of 'swipe'-s you'll see Stone Gaze. Let's say that Stone Gaze has a
counter of six points. Stone Gaze will be used after:
- Evrae has been target of three physical attacks that dealt damage
- Evrae has been target of six magical attacks that dealt damage
- Evrae has been target of say... four magical and one physical attack
- as you can easily see, physical attack adds two points, and magical attack
adds one point to the counter (Special skills do not count)
- Stone Gaze is not used anymore after Evrae used Haste on itself (ie after its
HP falls below 10665)
- I noticed a glitch here: I had Tidus with Ribbon armor be the target of Stone
Gaze. He wasn't petrified, but he was slowed. Even more, I wasn't able to input
anymore commands for him (he wasn't even in ATB bar, heh).
Let's talk strategy - use Tidus, Auron and Lulu for now. Start by having Tidus
cast Haste-ga on party, then using Auron's Mental Break on Evrae, followed by
Lulu's Focus. Take first swipe. Then Auron uses Power Break, Lulu chucks
another Focus and Tidus is switched for Rikku. With her use Silver Hourglass
you might have obtained on your trips so far. If not, select to Pull Back.
About now Evrae will probably inhale. You're set.
Now you'll be shelled continuously with Photon Spray (or get to see a turn of
Evrae missing with Poison Breath) - each chr will take between 300 and 500
damage, but this is nothing dangerous yet. I bet you've accumulated a bunch of
Al Bhed Potions during your desert trip. And it just so happens that Rikku can
use them. So do that. After each Photon Spray have Rikku use Al Bhed Potion.
Meanwhile switch out Lulu and Auron bring in Wakka and Tidus. Tidus Hastes
Wakka and Rikku as well, then have Wakka attack, and Rikku be on healing duty.
Alternatively, have Rikku Mix two Distillers (bought any so far?) to get Mighty
G - this will bestow current frontline party with Haste, Shell and Protect! On
Tidus' next turn switch him out and bring Lulu back.
Now have Wakka attack, Lulu cast spells (or use Focus again for up to 5 times)
and Rikku use Al Bhed Potion after each Photon Spray (or two Photon Sprays in
case you didn't take much damage from first one).
Each turn Cid gets in his ship away from Evrae, he'll use Homing Missiles - 12
hits VS Evrae, each for about 200 damage. It can only do so 3 times, tho',
before running out of ammo. Heh.
After Evrae has 10665 or less HP remaining, it'll use Haste on itself. Photon
Spray is no longer used, instead you face Swooping Scythe (sometimes it is used
as a counter, so watch out - thanks to Gestahl for this). You'll need to get
close and personal! Wakka's Dark Attack will take care of Evrae's 'Swipe' and
Swooping Scythe attacks. As Stone Gaze doesn't deal any damage, you'll only
need to use a Soft or even better, Al Bhed Potion. This item will also heal
your problems after Poison Breath. To negate Evrae's Haste status, you'll need
to Dispel it. If none of your chrs know it, that's quite alright.
Do *not* try to Slow it, as it'll automatically counter with Haste. The *only*
way to Slow it down again is Reflecting Evrae and one of your chrs, then
casting Slow on that reflected chr. Evrae will get Slow and automatically
counter with Haste on itself. Newsflash, hehe. As Evrae is under Reflect, it'll
bounce off and Evrae will remain Slow-ed for remainder of the battle. Do not
remove Reflect! Any action you take against Evrae will prompt it to counter
with Haste on itself. As long as Evrae is under Reflect, you have nothing to
fear.
So, remember to heal Petrify status, to slow Evrae down (at least until Haste
phase) and to heal when necessary!

LEVEL 5 PRIZE: HP Sphere

BS - Bevelle Sphere
DS - Destruction Sphere
GS - Glyph Sphere

STEP 1: This is a general rule. Whenever I say push pillar back, it means
you'll have to push it into the electric (?) current, which will cause pillar
to disappear and form a platform, which Tidus will use to be transported to
various ends. You're currently on level 1. For this pic push pillar ahead. Do
not toy around with BS1 already inserted into it. You won't need it. And any BS
must be inserted into this pillar anyway, otherwise you cannot use it.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/betemple01.jpg

STEP 2: As you see, Tidus is on a green glyph that points out a green arrow.
This green glyph only has one direction. There are green glyphs with two
directions and one with three. Fret not, all will be explained. Press X to be
'shot' in arrow's direction.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/betemple02.jpg

STEP 3: This will be called level 2. There are three green glyphs ahead, marked
with G1, G2 and G3. G1 has directions of forward (leads to G2, G3 and DE) and
to the right (leads to level 3). G2 has directions to left and right. G3 has
directions of forward and backward. DE marks dead end. If you'll be shot into
DE, you won't die, you'll simply reappear a bit before G1.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/betemple03.jpg
Oh yeah, look at green glyphs' arrow directions. For example, if you travel
over G1, Tidus will continue going forward. However, if you travel over G1 and
arrow points to the right as you press X button, Tidus' path will change.
Understood? Okay, aim for G2, direction left.

STEP 4: Retrieve BS2 from recess.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/betemple04.jpg

STEP 5: Push pillar back in and travel thru DE. Now aim for G2, direction
right. Here insert BS2 into the recess.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/betemple05.jpg

STEP 6: Push pillar back in and travel thru DE. Now aim for G1, direction
right.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/betemple06.jpg

STEP 7: This is main green glyph of level 3. I'll mark it as G4. Number 1 marks
right direction, number 2 marks forward direction and number 3 marks left
direction.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/betemple07.jpg

STEP 8: As you arrive onto G4, you have all the time in the world to make a
choice. Choose direction 1!
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/betemple08.jpg

STEP 9: You will arrive onto level 4 platform. Retrieve BS3 from recess.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/betemple09.jpg

STEP 10: Push pillar back and you arrive onto G4 again. Choose direction 2 now
and let it carry you all way to the end, so that you will reappear at G4, as
showed on this pic...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/betemple10.jpg
... notice G5 further ahead? It has directions of forward and right. You're
standing on G4 now, so choose direction 2 again. Don't do anything yet.

STEP 11: Showed on this pic are G6 and G7, DE as well. Both G6 and G7 have
direction of forward and right. Fall thru DE to reappear at G4. Aim for G7,
direction right.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/betemple11.jpg

STEP 12: Here insert BS3 into the recess. Push pillar back and fall thru DE.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/betemple12.jpg

STEP 13: Aim for G6, direction right. Remove GS from the recess. Push pillar
back and fall thru DE.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/betemple13.jpg

STEP 14: Aim for G7, direction right. Once you arrive at the place where you
inserted BS3 before, a path was created. Proceed down this path and insert GS
into recess found on invisible wall.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/betemple14.jpg

STEP 15: Retrieve DS. Push pillar back and fall thru DE.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/betemple15.jpg

STEP 16: Aim for G6, direction right. Insert DS into the recess. Push pillar
back and fall thru DE.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/betemple16.jpg

STEP 17: Aim for G7, direction right. Retrieve BS3 you inserted before. Push
pillar back and fall thru DE.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/betemple17.jpg

STEP 18: Aim for G5, direction right. Careful now! Push pillar further ahead
(on this pic this would mean down) to continue.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/betemple18.jpg

STEP 19: Back at level 1, but this time near the exit. Insert BS3 you're
carrying into the recess found up the stairs.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/betemple19.jpg

STEP 20: To your right is a chest with HP Sphere. Congrats, for you just broke
Destruction sigil for this temple. Only one more to go!
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/betemple20.jpg

STEP 21: Step on shining glyph that was below the chest to teleport the pillar
(you were using so far for travelling) near your position.
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/betemple21.jpg

STEP 22: Push the pillar to the left. After traversing thru small tunnel,
you'll get Knight Lance. Tidus returns automatically...
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/betemple22.jpg
... all that you need to do is to go right past shining glyph to complete this
boring Cloister. Long story sequence.

*****************************************************************************

Ugh, a maze. I hate these. You start with Yuna only (next to a save sphere), so
you need to be careful at least until you collect your reinforcements. In this
small room you'll see a teleporter with blinking arrow. It will blink in one
direction two times, then move one spot counter-clockwise. Let's say arronw is
blinking up (ie north). Step on teleporter at this point and you'll be moved to
another teleporter (tel. from now on).
There's a total of six tel. found in this dungeon:
- first at extreme south (can get to sixth)
- second at extreme east (can get to sixth)
- third at extreme north (can get to sixth)
- fourth at extreme north-west corner (unavailable yet)
- fifth at extreme west (can get to sixth)
- sixth in the middle of the dungeon (can get to first, second, third, fifth)
Furthermore, only one tel. is active at any given time, starting with first
tel. For example, you use first tel. to warp to sixth. Sixth is now the one
active. If you try to use say third tel. to warp to sixth, it won't work.
There's a total of eight rooms you visit during your trek thru Via Purifico:
- first at extreme south (contains save sphere and first tel.); this room is
linked to second, fifth, sixth and seventh
- second at extreme east (contains second tel.); this room is linked to first
and third
- third at extreme north (contains third tel. and save sphere); this room is
linked to second and fifth
- fourth at extreme north-west corner (unavailable yet, but you can't enter it
due to some steel bars blocking the path)
- fifth at extreme west (contains fifth tel.); this room is linked to first,
third and sixth
- sixth at extreme south-west corner (contains tel. release seal); this room is
linked to first and fifth
- seventh in the middle of the dungeon (contains sixth tel.); this room is
linked to first, third and eighth
- eighth to the right of seventh room (contains sealed tel.); this room is
linked to seventh

As I said, you start in first room. Go east to reach second room. In here
you'll find Kimahri, as well as chest with 1x Mega-Potion. Continue up north
and follow the path until you reach third room. Here you'll get Auron back. Go
west now. At next intersection go south (west path is blocked by some bars),
then south again and you will reach fifth room. Taking east tunnel here will
lead you to Lulu and 1x White Magic Sp. chest.
Take south tunnel again, and go south yet again to reach sixth room. In one
corner you will receive 1x Elixir from a friendly chest, in the other examine a
strange glyph... you've broken the seal! Now go north, at intersection go east
and you're back in first room. Go north now to reach seventh room. From this
room take north tunnel again, but at intersection take east path to arrive in
eighth room. Here nail 1x Black Magic Sp., and step on formerly inactive tel.
Sixth tel. will go wacky, destroy the bars blocking access between third and
seventh room, and reposition itself just to the right of fourth room (the one
you cannot get inside because of some bars).
From eighth room go west, at intersection north to arrive in third room. Take
west path now and you will soon find tel. escapee.:) Step on it when the arrow
is pointing west. You're finally inside fourth room. Loot the chests for Lucid
Ring (Silenceward, Confuseward, Poisonward), 1x Skill Sphere, 10000 Gil. When
done, step on tel. when the arrow is pointing east. When warping is complete,
go east to arrive in third room again. Finally take north tunnel... beware, you
cannot escape from random battles inside this red glowing tunnel!

a) 'Countdown' - uses turns charging for Overdrive
b) Mega Flare - NATT VS all chrs - mgd
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY | For starters I suggest getting both Yuna and Bahamut into full
Overdrive. First battle is against Grothia. As it starts with full Overdrive,
*Grand Summon* Bahamut and use Shield. Take about 500 or so damage. Unleash
Mega Flare. Grothia goes aaaargh. If Grothia still lives, finish off with
Impulse. Second battle is against Pterya. Summon Bahamut and have him unleash
another Mega Flare. If this doesn't kill Pterya, later pound away with physical
attacks. Lastly it's Spathi. Easy! It'll use four turns to Countdown to its
Overdrive. I suggest summoning Shiva for she'll most likely be fastest Aeon you
have. Once Spathi's Overdrive is about to hit, use Shield and I guarantee that
Shiva will survive. Then Spathi returns to Countdown... yawn. Kick its ass.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now it's down to three remaining party members. There's a save sphere on your
left and tresure chest shop on your right (what's a shop doing down here
anyway?). After your stocks are refreshed, proceed east, then north up to the
next save sphere. Oh, an old friend...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SENSOR: Weak against healing effects.
SCAN: Beware its Stone Gaze and nasty counter-attacks. Open the gate locks to
get some distance. Since it's a zombie, healing magic and items are the way to
go.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
a) Stone Gaze - NATT VS one chr - mgd + inflicts Petrify
b) Photon Spray - NATT VS all chrs - mgd - deals 8 hits to random targets
c) 'Swipe' - (CATT) VS one chr - phd
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY | Easy! Just use two Phoenix Downs on Evrae and you win! Why would you
complicate things if you don't have to?;)
Well, it's most likely that Evrae will get first turn, in which it'll use Stone
Gaze. Chances are high you're down by one chr. Still want challenge? Any attack
you do to Evrae, it'll counter with 'Swipe' for about 800 damage. Photon Spray
will hit 8 times, each hit dealing about 100 damage. Two Phoenix Downs is still
fastest way to go. Do not destroy gate locks during battle or you'll miss out
on two counterattack weapons!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once doors are opened, loot two chests you'll come across for Avenger (Counter-
Attack) and Rematch (Evade & Counter). Then swim thru the exit...

'Highbridge'
Buy at O'aka. How does this guy know where to be, hehe? Reflect will be
your best friend in the next boss battle! LEARN IT! Enemies here guarantee that
you'll have Yuna learn Reflect faster than a speeding chocobo! After taking a
sprint down the bridge you'll approach a save sphere. Few more steps forward
and...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY | This is entirely a strategic boss battle. Remember last encounter
with this guy? The battle starts with Tidus, Yuna and Kimahri. As soon as
Kimahri gets his first turn, throw him out and bring in Auron. Characters are
set, now let's talk strategy.
First I'll present a three stage overview on how the boss attacks, that looks
like this...
---> Round 1 (Natus' HP range is between 36000 and 24000 HP):
Mortibody - Blizzard / Desperado (in case all three chrs are under Haste)
Natus - Multi-Blizzara
Mortibody - Thunder / Desperado (in case all three chrs are under Haste)
Natus - Multi-Thundara
Mortibody - Water / Desperado (in case all three chrs are under Haste)
Natus - Multi-Watera
Mortibody - Fire / Desperado (in case all three chrs are under Haste)
Natus - Multi-Fira
After this the cycle repeats...
---> Round 2 (Natus' HP range is between 23999 and 12000 HP):
Natus - Protect (triggered by first attack that crosses 24000 HP limit)
Mortibody - Shattering Claw / Desperado (in case all three chrs are under
Haste)
Natus - Break
---> Round 3 (Natus' HP range is between 11999 and 0 HP):
Mortibody - Cura / Desperado (in case all three chrs are under *same* status,
say all three are Protected etc.)
Natus - Flare (good thing about it is great delay of Natus' next turn)

Pay attention on what spell Mortibody uses. It starts with Blizzard. If it uses
Fire (or any level 1 spell for that matter - deals about 250 damage to all
chrs), Natus will use Multi-Fira (hits two chrs for 1400 damage each). So it's
advised that Yuna goes after Mortibody, but before Natus so that she can cast
respective Nul spell. If she can't do that, have her switch weapons or do
anything else that might bring her a turn before Natus gets one.
If you don't want to be bothered by that, Shell all chrs. Heal with help of
Mega-Potions or Hi-Potions. Don't forget to talk to Natus with Tidus and Auron
to increase their Str for 10 points. Cheer will increase Str and Def even more,
while Focus will help increasing Mag and Mdef.
Besides Shell cast Haste on two and only *two* characters. Don't Haste all
three of your chrs, as Mortibody is very allergic to three hasted chrs and will
use Desperado on first turn he gets (in later stages of battle I figured
Mortibody will use Desperado even in cases all three of my chrs are under
Reflect or Protect; however, it won't Desperado if two chr are under Reflect,
and third under Protect; so as long as only two chrs are affected with same
positive status, you're safe from Desperado). Auron is here for physical power
- he'll by far be your strongest character. Don't bother with Break skills as
Mortibody is immune to them, while Natus can only be Power Breaked, but it is
useless, as he doesn't attack physically.
Once Natus' HP is 23999 or less, he'll use Protect. Really? Use Dispel. If you
don't have that, it'll be harder and longer. BIG TIP: Dispel Protect effect by
calling Ixion and using Aerospark on Natus. DO NOT Overdrive. Lately I found
out this: If you 'kill' Mortiorchis, ie freeing it of all its HP, it will drain
HP from its ally. However, if by doing that Natus crosses 23999 HP remaining
limit, he will not use Protect! Or you could reload and fight random enemies
some more on the Highbridge until Yuna learns Dispel. Mortibody and Natus no
longer use element spells in this stage of battle. Now you'll be shelled with
Break, which petrifies one chr. Use Esuna or Soft immediately - do not let
Mortibody get his turn before you. Why? It'll use Shattering Claw, which
shatters petrified chr and removes that chr from battle. Randomly it may happen
that you get lucky and Mortibody uses Shattering Claw against character who
isn't petrified.
After Natus' HP is 11999 or less, he gets to test out Flare - hits for around
2000. Mortibody will now use Cura on its partner. The good thing about Flare is
that it greatly delays Natus' next turn. Recast Shell if it was removed cos of
Desperado (in case you accidentally Hasted all of your chrs) to halve Flare
damage. Also remember to cure the chr that got hit. Attack with the rest of
chrs until Natus bites the dust. Again, hehe.
Summoning Aeons? Go ahead, but note that they'll be Banished immediately, so
bring one in with full Overdrive and fire away.
As I said, Reflect is your best friend in this battle. If you have Yuna cast it
at everybody, it'll bounce back *every* spell Natus will chuck at you,
including Break and Flare! Only way you can get dispeled is Desperado.
Additional strategic tips: Natus can be poisoned. Each turn he'll spend doing
something will rip off 1440 HP. And lastly, if you have Stoneproof armor in
your stock for chr that has Provoke (most likely Tidus) - here's a great tip:
in second part of battle use Provoke with whoever is wearing Stoneproof armor.
Natus will be using Break on that character only (and in third part of battle
Flare). So now you have two free characters which can easily smite down Natus,
while character-who-did-Provoke's only job is healing him/herself.
BIG BREAKTHRU: Poison Natus. And then only heal yourself. DON'T ATTACK HIM AT
ALL COSTS. Whatever you do, DO NOT ATTACK HIM whatsoever during the fight. Nor
try anything else!!! Just leave him alone! When Natus is poisoned, every turn
he'll spend will cause him to lose 1440 HP. Wait 25 turns and he is defeated!
The biggest catch is that even when he's over 24000 and 12000 HP limits, he'll
continue to use Multi-spells. Now if this isn't better than Break and Flare...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make a stop at Agency now. After the scene talk to everybody, refresh your
stock, then proceed to northwestern part of Calm Lands.
Find a chocobo lady in here somewhere (she's located directly north of Rin's
shop in Calm Lands). At extreme northwest there is Vol. XXIII *KEY ITEM*. Train
a chocobo by completing a first course, then choose to quit.
After you've trained the chocobo, prompt the lady to ride one. Now loot the
chests found in these parts. They contain: Lv.2 Key Sp., 10000 Gil, 5000 Gil.
Go back to where you came to Calm Lands and go right. There's a chocobo feather
in the ground here, that leads to Remiem temple.

'Remiem Temple'
Save at the entrance. Go left and examine sphere on the floor. Further ahead is
Vol. XXIV *KEY ITEM*.
Now go all the way right and mount the chocobo. Win the race with:
- first win will nab Cloudy Mirror *KEY ITEM*
- with one opened chest: Elixir
- with two: Megalixir
- with three: 30x Wings to Discovery!!! This is why we came here!
Forget about Belgemine inside the temple for now and exit this area back to
Calm Lands. Mount the chocobo and use chocobo feather found here.
There's a place called Arena here in the east. I suggest letting it be for now,
but do buy weapons with Capture ability for later usage.
Proceed for northeastern part where the exit is.

'Calm Lands: Near Bridge'
Save.

SENSOR: Made of stone. Resistant to physical attacks.
SCAN: Boasts very high physical attack and defence. Its counter-attack Blast
Punch delays target and causes damage. Casts Mighty Guard and Slowga.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
a) Blast Punch - CATT & GRATTP VS one chr - phd - tears off 50% current HP +
delays next turn
b) Mighty Guard - on oneself - gains NulAll, Protect, Shell
c) 'Punch' - VS one chr - phd
d) Haymaker - VS one chr - heavy phd
e) Slowga - CATT VS all chrs - inflicts Slow - used as a counter after Defender
X has been a target five consecutive magical attacks, or five items have been
used on it, or after many other possible combos
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY | Start the battle with Tidus, Yuna and Auron. Tidus uses Haste/ga
first on all characters (and maybe few Cheers as well), Yuna casts Protect,
Auron uses Armor Break.
Boss will usually physically attack you with 'Punch' for about 1700 damage.
Each fourth turn it will use Haymaker (this attack always connects!) for about
3200 damage. Blast Punch is its countermove - beside ripping off 50% of current
health it also delays target's next turn. Blast Punch is used after any of
following combinations: two physical attacks (rarely three), three magical
attacks, combo consisting of one *or* two magical and one physical attack (and
many more combinations... after figuring out what triggers Slowga counter in
some cases I found it impossible to figure out all examples of triggering Blast
Punch counter). So if you're going physical on it, expect Blast Punch each
second attack you do on it. I've also figured out when to expect Slowga
counter. If you target X with five fire spells consecutively, you'll see Slowga
counter after fifth fire spell you chuck at it. I also managed to be Slowga-ed
after I used three Bomb Cores on DX, among other things.
Easy. Use Provoke with Tidus. DX will only use Blast Punch from now on.
Meanwhile have your chrs bomb away at the boss until it's gone.
Hard. Once Auron has Armor Breaked DX, switch him out and bring in Wakka. Have
him use Dark Attack or Buster on DX to blind it. Its regular 'Punch' will miss
most of the time now. Haymaker can't be avoided. Of course, don't forget to put
Wakka on Haste and Protect. Once done, switch Tidus for Auron and proceed to
pummel at the boss. And how to keep up your HP? With following summary it
should be easy - Wakka keeps using Dark Attack (or Buster, since it will almost
always inflict Darkness), Auron attacks normally, and Yuna is assigned as
healer should some of DX's attacks connect. Absolutely heal before and after
Haymaker. Once DX's HP fall below 25%, it may decide to cast Mighty Guard on
itself (this is also an impossible task, for I cannot figure out what triggers
it). Easy. Just Dispel it.
Armor Break DX again cos Dispel you just use removed Armor Break as well.
Continue as usual and DX bites the dust. But why bother with complicate
strategy when you can just use Provoke with Tidus and boss goes buh-bye before
you know it.

e) Haste - on oneself - adds Haste
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY | Long, but easy. For starters, don't physically attack them if
they're both on same Kimahri's side. If you do that, the other one will block
the attack and greatly reduce damage done. I suggest using magical attacks or
attack items from your stock with Use (in case you took Kimahri down Rikku's
path like I suggested). Wait! Don't kill them too fast. Each of these two can
be used to get Kimahri four Overdrives.
One (I'll call him Y-guy) can be Lancet-ed for Stone Breath, Aqua Breath, Fire
Breath and White Wind (White Wind must be used by Y-guy first, otherwise you
won't learn it).
The other (B-guy) has Self-Destruct, Thrust Kick, Doom and Mighty Guard (like
with Y-guy, Mighty G must be used by B-guy first).
Y goes like this: Fire Breath, Bulldoze, Aqua Breath, Bulldoze, repeat. Damage
done ranges from 70 to 120.
B goes like this: Thunder, Bulldoze, Blizzard, Bulldoze, repeat. You're looking
for damage done from 50 to 100.
As the fight progresses, there will be a point at which either Y or B will lose
over 75% of HP. At this point both of them will make an action: Y will use
White Wind and B will use Mighty Guard. Both moves are used as a counter only
once.
Once you kill off Y, B will cast Berserk on himself and only use Bulldoze from
now on. If you kill off B, Y will Haste himself. Don't bother dispelling, as
he'll recast it again. So better idea is to kill off Y first.
In case you accidentally kill either one of them off without learning Mighty
Guard and White Wind, don't reload and try again. Soon thereafter there are
enemies which you can learn these two skills from. All in all, this is not a
hard battle.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

After you're done defeating those two suckers (finally, I might add), proceed
further north.

'Gagazet: Mountain Trail'
Straight at beginning go all the way up and back to nail a chest with 20000
gil. Nabbing the rest of the chests will get you: 2x Mega-Potion, Defending
Bracer, HP Sphere, Lv.4 Key Sp. - use this to unlock way to Zombie Attack on
Auron's path. When you see a small path branching off to the right, take it.
You'll find Braska's Sphere *KEY ITEM*. When you run into Wantz, buy Zombie
Ward armors for Yuna and Auron. You should also customize five Zombie Ward
armors by buying respective amount of Holy Waters. After a long trek thru the
outer part of Gagazet, save.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY | This is entirely a strategic boss battle. Start battle with Tidus,
Yuna and Kimahri. Characters are set, now let's talk strategy. First I'll
present a three stage overview on how the boss attacks, that looks like this...
---> Round 1 (Flux's HP range is between 70000 and 52500 HP):
Flux - Lance of Atrophy
Mortiorchis - Full-Life
Flux - Lance of Atrophy
Mortiorchis - Full-Life
Flux - Dispel
Mortiorchis - Cross Cleave
After this the cycle repeats...
---> Round 2 (Flux's HP range is between 52499 and 35000 HP):
Flux - Protect (triggered by first attack that crosses 52500 HP limit)
Flux - Lance of Atrophy
Mortiorchis - Full-Life
Flux - Lance of Atrophy
Mortiorchis - Full-Life
Flux - Dispel
Mortiorchis - Cross Cleave
After this the cycle repeats except for Protect part...
---> Round 3 (Flux's HP range is between 34999 and 0 HP):
Flux - Reflect (triggered by first attack that crosses 35000 HP limit)
Mortiorchis - 'Auto-attack mode'
Flux - Flare on himself
Mortiorchis - 'Ready to annihilate.'
Flux - 'S. watches... and waits.'
Mortiorchis - Total Annihilation
Flux - Flare on himself
Mortiorchis - 'Ready to annihilate.'
Flux - Reflect (if you removed it with Dispel) / 'S. watches... and waits.'
After this the cycle repeats...
Want an easy way? Have Rikku mix 2x Wings to Discovery for Trio of 9999. Attack
8 times and Flux is gone.
Hard, eh? Start with Tidus (Hastega!), Yuna (Reflect!) and Kimahri (Mighty
Guard!). If you Talk to Flux with Yuna, her Mag Def will increase for 10
points. You can increase Kimahri's Str for 10 points by doing the same
(although forget it, cos you need heavy hitters for this battle). Once Kimahri
made his magic with Mighty G., switch him out for Auron. Haste, Protect, Shell
and Reflect him, in that order. Now you're set. Reflect is recommended, but not
necessary - namely, sole purpose is to have it assist you bounce back Full-
Lives that Mortiorchis will be casting at you.
You can easily predict what Mortiorchis will do by following Flux's actions.
Flux will be using Lance of Atrophy two times, then Dispel. The pattern then
repeats itself until his health reaches 52499. Lance deals about 500 damage and
causes Zombie. I hope you bought and customized those Zombie Ward armors. Each
turn you spend not healing Zombie is a good turn. As soon as Mortiorchis gets a
turn after Flux, it'll cast Full-Life on zombied chr, KO-ing him/her. On each
third turn Mortiorchis will use Cross Cleave for about 2500 damage to everyone
- that's why we're Protected. After this turn *heal* everyone up. *Never*
attack Morti. with Delay Attack/Buster or try to cast Slow on it. It won't
work, and it will counter with Slowga (however, I noticed that by 'killin'
Morti., ie forcing it to use Mortibsorption on its ally at least once will
remove Slowga counter).
Then pattern repeats itself. Interesting note - this boss will always go like
this: Flux, Morti., Flux, Morti., Flux, Morti. Even if Flux gets another turn
before Morti., he *won't* do anything productive.
So what to do in this part of battle? First, Haste, Protect, Shell and Reflect
everyone you'll be using. Attack normally until Morti. used two Full-Lives,
meaning it'll use Cross Cleave on its third turn. Before that we must take care
that Flux won't Dispel what we worked hard to achieve. Bring in Wakka and have
him use Silence Attack or Buster on Flux. He won't be able to use Dispel, hehe.
Switch Wakka out and bring back whoever you threw out (Wakka probably isn't
under Protect). Then have everybody Defend - with this (and help of Protect)
damage Cross Cleave does will be lessened by 75%. Okay, you're set until Flux
reaches next phase. It's also recommended to Bio Flux, so he'll get poisoned.
When Flux goes in 52K, he'll Protect himself. Yawn. Use Dispel and no Protect
for him. Later he'll continue to repeat Lance/Full-Life combo, with Cross
Cleave on third turn.
When Flux goes over 50% HP lost - first it'll use Reflect as a counter (use
Dispel!!!), and then use Flare on next turn. If Flux is under Reflect at time
he casts Flare, he'll use it on himself to be reflected at your party. But if
you remove Reflect prior to that... hehehe.;)
First turn Mortiorchis gets after 50% limit, it'll enter Auto-Attack mode. On
second turn it'll be 'Ready to annihilate!'. On third turn you'll get Total
Annihilation. Each character will receive about 4000 damage, 2000 if under
Shell. Then Morti. needs only two turns to get ready for another TA. Also you
won't see Lance of Atrophy anymore, so heal any zombies you still have!
What does Flux do during this time? After TA first turn Flux gets will use to
cast Flare on himself. If he's still Reflected, receive the punishment. If
Reflect is missing, however, he'll nail himself for about 2000 damage. On his
next turn he'll either skip it or Reflect himself again if you dispeled it
before.
Now the only danger that is left is Morti.'s TA. You can take care of Flare by
dispeling Reflect Flux casts on himself, but all you need to do to make it thru
TA is have at least 3200 HP and be under Shell. I guarantee you'll survive.
Even better: A single chr in battle against Flux with 3000 HP, really low Mag
Def and under Shell (Haste is also welcome) will be hit only *five* times. This
means chr will only take 2400 damage or less. This is tried and tested. If you
haven't been neglecting agility, you're bound to kick his ass with only one chr
alive.
Is it still so hard beating this boss?
Oh yeah, in case you'll be summoning Aeons: it's best to hit Flux with their
Overdrives, as he'll Banish them as soon as you throw anything at him.
BIG BREAKTHRU: As with previous fight with this guy, cast Haste, THEN Bio on
him and then STOP ALL ATTACKS ON HIM. Wait 50 turns for him to do his actions -
each will rip off 1400 of his health, including on turns he skips cos he got a
turn in faster than Mortiorchis. During this time you mustn't do anything to
him, not even Scan him. As soon as you do, bang! He'll start using Total
Annihilation and Flare... but if you don't touch him at all, all you'll be
seeing are Lance of Atrophy, Full-Life, Dispel and Cross Cleave.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bye! Hope I've seen you one last time. Continue on. Before saving at next save
sphere check between the pillars on the left. You'll find Saturn Crest *KEY
ITEM*. You'll enter...

'Gagazet: Mountain Cave'
Proceed up the stairs. At next intersection go left and into the water.

'Gagazet: Submerged Passage 2'
At the end send Rikku in green hole and Tidus in blue hole (in case you don't
get it - colors correspond to chr's color on the Sphere Grid). Collect Fortune
Sphere. Then back you go.

'Gagazet: Mountain Cave'
Return to known save sphere now. At first intersection on Mountain Cave go left
again, then immediately right. Nab Pep Talk. At second intersection I mentioned
earlier now go right. Path leads to Recovery Ring and Return Sphere. Back to
Mountain Cave. At second intersection go left again. Now look for a set of

What to do prior to battle? Get at least *one* armor with Confuseproof (steal
Musks from floating one-eye enemies) - best would be three such armors for
these chrs - Tidus, Yuna, Wakka.
Easy way? Rikku's Mix of two Wings to Discovery for Trio of 9999, which allows
any character to hit for 9999 damage.
Hard way? It's also an easy way, but with a bit of strategy involved. SK opens
the battle by using Photon Wings on its first turn. It causes 1000 damage to
all and sleep, silence, darkness, curse, confusion - you're bound to get a few
of these babies. I don't mind first four, but confusion is an absolute killer,
so I really suggest getting Confuseproof armors.
SK's second and third turn are 'Swipe'-s for about 1300 damage to one chr. On
fourth turn it'll use Mana Breath for 3000 damage to one.
Now it gets annoying. SK's fifth and sixth turns are Curaga on itself. You can
tamper with it a bit and have it cast something else with following actions:
- if you Reflect SK, then it will use Reflect on you in order to be able to
heal itself; not recommended
- if Armor Break is used on SK, it will cast Protect
- if you put additional negative statuses on SK (except Slow!), Armor Break
takes first priority, ie SK will use Protect instead of Curaga; very
recommended
- if under bad statuses, but Armor Break is not included, it will cast Esuna
- it may not necessarily use Curaga, it may choose to use Regen
Does SK have any other attacks in its arsenal? Yep. Sometimes during battle it
may Protect itself (only if Armor Broken) - remove that with Dispel. Yawn.
Lastly you have Tail Sweep. Don't worry, I have it all figured out.;) This is
its nasty countermove - hits everybody for about 600 damage, removes Haste and
delays next turn. If however, you put Blind on SK, chances of Tail Sweep
dealing damage to all chrs in decreased. There's more: it'll be used as a
counterattack to anything that would tamper with SK's HP (White magic, Black,
Skills), but never sooner than third such attack, and never later than sixth
attack. In other words, as soon as you attack SK for third time dealing damage
(up to sixth attack), expect Tail Sweep counter.
Oh yeah, don't try to use Slow on SK by casting it (SK will automatically
counter with Haste). You can inflict Slow on SK only like this... First have
Yuna cast Reflect on SK, then have Rikku follow with Silver or Gold Hourglass
being used on SK. Ta-daah! You just Slowed SK down significantly. Of course SK
will counter by casting Haste on itself, but it will bounce off cos of Reflect
we put into place. Much like Evrae, each and every attack you land on SK will
now prompt it to counter with Haste on itself, hehe. You can toy with him until
it gets down to 19999 HP, at which point it becomes smart enough to cast
Reflect on your party members, and then casting Esuna (or whatever suits the
situation) on that reflected member to heal itself of bad statuses.
So Yuna, Tidus and Wakka. What to do with you three? Tidus casts Hastega for
starters. Yuna follows with Shell on everyone, and Wakka keeps attacking with
Dark Attack or Buster. Wakka uses only Dark Attack or Buster!!! This is to
ensure that you'll never see Curaga. You'll get hit by Photon Wings - use
Remedy, Esuna or whatever is needed to get back in fighting shape (give
priority to confused chrs). Then it's two turns of 'Swipe', which should miss
thanks to SK being blinded. Same goes for Tail Sweep.;) Get Mana Breathed upon.
Heal character that got hit. Wakka still uses Dark Attack. Now if you did as I
suggested, instead of two Curagas you'll see two Esunas. Pattern than repeats
itself... You can help yourself more, if you wish: Using Magic Break on SK will
significantly lower his magic abilities - instead of 9999 HP it will heal
itself for 5000 or so. Mana Breath will deal about 1600 damage. Take note that
casting Dispel removes positive statuses *as well as any Breaks* you already
inflicted on SK. Casting Reflect on SK at start of battle is very helpful as
well - as it'll try to use curative magic on itself (Protect, Regen, Curaga,
Esuna) all of that will bounce of to your chrs (at least until the 19999-HP-
remaining-point as explained above). This is all you'll have to know to subdue
this sucker.

SCAN: Attacks all frontal targets when hit. It will plant a Glyph Mine upon a

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
a) Berserk Tail - VS one chr - phd + Berserk
b) 'Swipe' - CATT VS three tiles
c) Glyph Mine - plants a mine on two glyphs - if detonated while your chr is
standing on one, this chr is KO
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY | His only regular attack is Berserk Tail - does 1000 damage plus
Berserk. That's bad. Anything you do to it will prompt SK to counter with
'Swipe', that covers glyph SK is facing to plus glyphs on right and left, deals
1500 damage to everyone caught in this counterattack. There's six glyphs
surrounding SK. Put your characters with command Move on glyphs 1, 3, 5 or 2,
4, 6. Main thing is that none of your chrs are together. That way SK's counter
won't reach them all.
Lastly, SK may use Glyph Mine on first turn he gets after sustaining damage for
fourth time, on two glyphs, not necessarily ones you're standing on. If you
are, Move away. When Glyph Mine detonates, it's sure KO for chr standing on it.
So what to do? Cure Berserk ASAP (or if you have Berserkproof armor, you have
nothing to worry about). Only attack with your strongest character - Auron is
possibly your strongest one.
Well, bring in Yuna, Tidus and Auron. Hastega and Protect are basically all you
need. And few Esunas on the way. Remember to Move away from glyphs that are
about to explode - check the turn chart in upper right screen to see when
glyph's turn comes up.
Or if you want to play safe... You'll still need to cure Berserk sometimes, but
this way involves aeons. Have Yuna summon an aeon, but don't use aeon's
overdrive. Have aeon attack regularly. It takes SK three turns of doing
'Swipe', and on fourth it'll plant Glyph Mine. If you dismiss an aeon before
that happens, hehehe... (:P at SK) After mine explodes, have Yuna summon again
and repeat until SK is defeated.
Additional strategy: Have a chr with Berserkproof armor and have that chr use
Provoke on Spectral Keeper. Now continuously defend with Provoker while other
two members hack away at the boss until it's dead.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY | Get those Confuseproof armors out for one more time. Y. woman is
another boss with set pattern with few exceptions. Only status worth having in
this battle is Reflect.
Round 1: When Y. gets her normal turns, she'll alternate between Absorb and
'Punch'. Absorb removes 50% of MAX HP of chr targeted and gives same amount to
Y., also healing her (remember that it always targets chr with most current
HP). 'Punch' removes any positive status, but it's unable to remove Reflect. It
also deals about 300 damage. Y. also has a countermove for anything you do to
her - Sleep for specials, Blind for physicals and Silence for magic. You could
try zombifying your chrs if you have Zombie Attack - then Y. will kill herself
for the first round.
As battle starts, have Yuna cast Reflect on everybody. Now just proceed hacking
away at Y., laughing as none of her counters will hit you. Remember to heal the
member that gets hit with Absorb with items. Y. dies...
Round 2: Hellbiter will be used straight away. Nothing you can do about that.
*Stay as zombie for this round!* If you cure any / all zombies, you'll just get
Hellbiter-ed again. Waste of time? Certainly.
If all (or at least one member) is zombie, Y. will mostly be using Cura and
Regen. That's bad for zombies, you'll say. Nuh-uh, that's why we have Reflect
on.;) True, it'll heal her (cast Shell on Y. to halve healing effect), but
better that than be dead. So can you use any other status like Haste? Nope.
As soon as you attack Y., she may counter with 'Punch', which removes all
positive statuses except Reflect. Nothing dangerous left here, eh? Keep hacking
away at the boss. If she gets Regened, Dispel it. As long as you deal more
damage to her than she restores each round, you'll be okay. If she happens to
kill one of your chrs, revive that chr ASAP, then heal him/her, and Reflect it.
Also cure all zombies now and restore their health. Next attack Y. uses will
almost surely be Hellbiter, which again puts all three chrs in Zombie. Good
thing? All three are at nearly full HP. After all this Y. dies...
Round 3: Mega Death to all. Zombies too? Nope. Hehe. In this round Y. has a
set pattern - Mega Death, Hellbiter / Curaga / Regen, Hellbiter / Curaga /
Regen, Mind Blast (600 damage to all + Confusion, Curse or Sleep), Hellbiter /
Curaga / Regen, Mega Death, then repeat.
Hellbiter does 250 damage to all chrs. Naturally, keep all chrs as zombies so
Mega Death won't kill you. Neither will Curaga, cos it will be Reflected on Y.
(remember to use Shell in order to halve healing effect).
You still shouldn't bother with Haste or anything else cos of... yep, 'Punch'
counter still removes everything sans Reflect. Mind Blast will be her most
dangerous move - 600 damage to everybody and Confusion (also Sleep [inflicted
very rarely] and Curse [also low rate of connecting]). But if you got
Confuseproof armors like I suggested, you won't be affected. Y. dies for the
third and final time.
Finally, if at any time you'll be calling aeons for Overdrives obviously, be
warned. During phases one Y. alternates between 'Punch' and Absorb. During
phase two Y. alternates between Absorb and Hell Biter. In phase three she gets
even nastier. She uses Mind Blast (curses an aeon, thus disabling Overdrives),
then Absorb, then Osmose, then Absorb, and starts again with Mind Blast
(pattern is then repeated). Thanks to MrVandal for confirming Osmose used by Y.
in phase three). Of course, she still counters anything you chuck at her with
your Aeons. Y. can be Threatened, but don't count on it too often.

After she's defeated, go down the stairs in the back. This should make a chest
appear in far left corner of this room. If not, go down same stairs again. In

STRATEGY | Far away? Use Lulu's magic, Wakka's ball, or any other chr's magic
if you had them learn some so far (hopefully). It may attack your party with
'Strike' for about 1800 damage to every chr. Here's when to expect this attack
- after you've dealt damage to Sin for five times, first turn Sin gets after
that, 'Strike' will be used. If amount of times damage is dealt is four times
or less, Sin will remain motionless. Sometimes it may use Negation, which
nullifies any bad statuses you might have inflicted on it if you're far away.
If you're close when boss does Negation, it'll also remove any helpful statuses
on your party.
Close and personal? First it'll use three turns for either: 'Strike', which
deals about 1300 damage to all chrs or 'Sin remains motionless.'. On each
fourth turn core will get energized. Unload everything you have, but take heed
that you may get countered with Negation. Fifth turn will be Gravija, which
cannot kill you - you can avoid it altogether by selecting Pull Back in Trigger
Command window, but I find this to be a waste of time. Cid may not have a move
before Sin does. Stop all attacks now, and heal yourself to full. Negation
counter is expected as soon as second attack and as late as sixth attack
received. Again you'll either get attacked or Sin will remain motionless. So
wait (Defend!) for three such moves and once core energizes, attack! Repeat and
you win.

before Sin does. Stop all attacks now, and heal yourself to full. Negation
counter is expected as soon as second attack and as late as sixth attack
received. Again you'll either get attacked or Sin will remain motionless. So
wait (Defend!) for three such moves (beware - if you're under positive status
and you attack Sin when close, it may counter with Negation) and once core
energizes, attack! Repeat and you win.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY | Easy way? Rikku's Mix of two Wings to Discovery. It'll allow your
members to deal 9999 damage with *anything*. So just pound away, hehe.
Hard way? Not dangerous really. I suggest Tidus, Yuna and Auron. Hastega with
Tidus, then have Yuna Shell each member and finally have Auron attack. After
Yuna Shells everybody, also include Protect, if you wish. Genais has set
pattern - Venom, Venom, Thrashing. Venom deals about 1600 damage and incurs
Poison (Esuna!), whereas Thrashing deals about 1600 damage to all chrs. Use
Shell and Protect respectively. Don't use magic on Genais (it doesn't counter
Demi), otherwise it'll counter with Waterga for 2500 damage on the attacker.
What about the core? As long as Genais is out, core will not act at all. It'll
only act if you attack it physically - the only way is by Wakka. But that's a
waste of time and also you may get countered by level 1 spell or Negation.
Genais must die! My thoughts exactly. Slow and Silence it! Once you knock off
50% of its health (9999 HP and lower), it'll go in its shell on first turn
Genais gets. Now anything you do to Genais while in its shell will prompt it to
counter with Cura. On its regular turn it'll use Sigh, which does about 1000
damage to all chrs and adds Darkness.
Meanwhile core will also start to act. First turn core gets (with Genais in its
shell) will get it energized. On next turn it'll unleash Gravija. It strikes
all chrs AND Genais, but if it's still in the shell, Genais is immune to
Gravija. So hit Genais once (just once is enough), see Cura counter and hope
that Genais will exit its core before Gravija. Bam, Genais is down to mere few
thousands. Use Mega-Potion to heal bad wounds and then unload everything you
have at Genais until it kicks the bucket. Only core remains!
It'll alternate turns between energizing core and Gravija. It may randomly
counterattack with level 1 elemental spells aimed at whole party, so beware.
Each spell deals about 500 damage to each chr. Sometimes it also counters with
Negation. Anyway, if you're careful not to let your HP drop below 500 (or 1000
just to be extra safe), core is as good as dead, right? Right!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Talk to everyone, then head for top of the ship. Here talk to Yuna. Who's the
girl you have highest affection with? Following sequence will answer that...
Lulu (Let's go! Just you and me.), Rikku (Don't worry. I'll cover you.) or
Yuna? Again head for top of the ship. Save.

b) Giga-Graviton - VS all chrs - Game over!
c) 'Flash attack' - STATT & CATT VS all chrs - std + inflicts Petrify,
Confusion and Zombie
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY | I recommend getting Stoneproof and Confuseproof armors for whoever
you'll be using. It rarely happens, but I did get my guys petrified, zombified
and confused during this battle. First it'll use 'Drawn to Sin.' three times.
'Flash attack', which is used as a counterattack after Sin sustains damage for
six times *or* on its regular turns - not very often, deals 700 damage to all
chrs along with a small chance to deal nasty status effects, like Petrify and
Confusion. Once Sin's Overdrive charges up, you have one more turn to defeat
it, otherwise you get Game Over.
So how to win? Easy way would be: Bring in Rikku, Wakka, and Lulu. Rikku's Mix
of two Wings to Discovery will allow everyone to deal 9999 damage. So after 15
hits Sin is gone.
Hard way? Start with Wakka, Lulu and Tidus. First have Tidus use Hastega on
everyone. Now have Lulu cast her level 3 spells and Wakka attack normally. If
Yuna's far enough to have learned Holy, use her instead of Wakka. When three
turns of 'Drawn to Sin' pass, change Lulu for Auron and Yuna for Wakka. Again
use Hastega with Tidus, Auron should Armor Break the thing.
Now you're set. You'll also be more set if you've reached end of Tidus' path,
where he learns Quick Hit. Then use Friend / Teleport Spheres to teleport other
chrs here (specifically Auron and Wakka) and have them learn Quick Hit as well.
Just pummel away at the boss - or use Quick Hit continuously. If you've
customized Confuseproof and Stoneproof armors, you have nothing to fear. Note
that you cannot halve damage done by 'Flash attack' in any way. You also can't
block Giga-Graviton with an aeon.

STRATEGY | Easy way? Rikku's Mix of two Wings to Discovery. It'll allow your
members to deal 9999 damage with *anything*. So just pound away, hehe.
Customize empty armors with SOS Nul abilities and have everyone who will
participate in battle in yellow HP prior to commencing actual battle. Why? SOS
Nul abilities *cannot* be dispeled nor do they disappear after a chr affected
with it has been struck with respective element attack. *wink* Die, Omnis!
Hard way? Easy as well. On first turns Omnis will use either level 2 (deals
1000 damage) or level 3 (deals 2500 damage) elemental spells, depending on how
Mortiphasms are turned. Halve the damage with Shell. Reflect is a bad idea, cos
Omnis may absorb the element he's currently using.
As Omnis starts with Fire element, I suggest equipping all chrs you'll be using
with Fireward-proof-eater ability. Thus you'll greatly lessen the damage he'll
do to you at the start of the battle. If you have Shell on top of it - great.
Also, if you'll follow the below strategy and you have sufficient Agility, I
assure you won't see any spells again except Dispel and Ultima.
Start battle with Tidus, Yuna and Auron. Tidus goes Hastega, Yuna goes way of
the Shell (or cast NulBlaze if you lack fire reducing armors) and Auron goes
Armor Break. Forget about squeaking around with Mortiphasms - it's complete
waste of time. Let's talk about how Omnis attacks can be turned to your
advantage. If you don't attack him, all Omnis will be doing is casting four
Firagas on his turn. Recast NulBlaze after each Omnis' move until following
happens...
Once you attack Omnis for *five* times (if you heal Omnis this is considered as
an 'attack' - same deal was with Sanctuary Keeper; even Stealing from Omnis
will count), Omnis will use Dispel on the first round he gets after your fifth
attack.
Dispel hits everyone and removes their positive statuses. Use Hastega
immediately. Also make sure that Yuna gets a turn before Omnis does.
Why? I'll tell you. Damage Ultima does is about 4000, and *cannot* be halved,
not even with Shell (odd, I know, but I'm sure of what I've written - Shell
does *not* halve the damage). So unless all chrs that are fighting don't have
over 4500 HP, you'll meet your end. That's why Yuna should... no, *must* get a
turn before Omnis can cast Ultima. Have her summon Aeon, then use Shield with
that Aeon. Ultima's damage will now be no bigger than summer's breeze. After
Ultima dismiss the Aeon! Funny thing about aeons I noticed the other day...
Mortiphasms can't be targetted for Overdrives! I tried using Shiva's Diamond
Dust on them, but it said they were out of range. WTF? Heheh. As an alternative
you could check if you have any Stamina Tonics in your inventory - this item
*doubles* MAX HP of all chrs in frontline party for one battle.
Next turn Omnis gets he will use it to rotate Mortiphasms until they all point
to ice element - meaning he'll be using Blizzagas. This is Omnis' turn, meaning
he'll have to wait until next one to use Blizzagas. During this time I hope
you're fast enough with help of Hastega to inflict damage on him five times, so
you'll forfeit his Blizzagas and *force* him to use Dispel. If you're not that
fast, remember to cast NulFrost to at least nullify two to three Blizzagas.
Again, after Dispel, Hastega immediately, assure that Yuna goes before Omnis
next turn comes up, summon Aeon, use Shield, wait until Ultima hits, dismiss an
Aeon, Omnis wastes a turn, you attack him five times, ad infinitum... or at
least until all 80000 HP are gone down the potty. Yay, now Omnis is finally
pushing up the daisies.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

'Sin: City of Dying Dreams'
Oh woman. Enemies here sure put up a challenge. Equip First Strike weapons cos
of Great Malboros around - you can easily get ambushed by them and then watch
helplessly as your chrs strike each other down. Use Silence Buster on
Demonoliths to disable Pharaoh's Curse counter. Slay Behemoth King with
counterattacks to have it not use Meteor.
As you set foot in here, go a bit forward and examine the wall on the right.
It'll tell you a sob story about 10 fiends that need to be killed. Once you
have killed 10 enemies - doesn't matter what kind (if you kill them with aeons,
enemies killed *will not* count - you must dirty your hands instead; thanks to
Dominic for this piece of info), examine the wall again and it will move away.
Another must-kill-10-fiends wall. Kill next 10 fiends, examine this second wall
and buh-bye to it, too. What? *Another wall?* And this time I must waste 15
fiends? Oh well, let's do it. Once also this matter is taken care of, examine
the wall to have it removed. Can you guess what's in the chest? It's a crappy
1x Lv.4 Key Sp.
Once you get to a hole in the floor, and the other side is accessible over a
blue square-shaped stone, press Circle to get access to Four-On-One weapon for
Wakka (Lightningstrike, Firestrike, Icestrike, Waterstrike). There's a hard-to-
miss pillar that can be pushed down, granting you access to one chest with
Defending Bracer (Darkproof, Deathproof, 2 FS). Continue on. Take a left as
soon as you can... a dead end? Not really. Examine the wall and it will move
away, revealing a chest with 1x Megalixir. Backtrack a bit, then proceed
further. You'll find a sort of a hole in the floor. Enter it and open another
chest for 20000 gil. Stepping on blue square found in this hole will launch you
to a chest with 1x HP Sp., then by taking a stroll down the slope to another
chest with 1x Defence Sp. Step on hovering blue square nearby to be safely
transported back to the ground. Carry on. You'll reach a wide area with pillars
rising from floor, disabling you to proceed further at certain points. Once you
reach a chasm, Tidus will look down. Another chest? Turn back a bit and try to
get into lower right corner of this open area. You'll notice a tunnel. Enter it
and slide down all the way. Chest you saw before contains Laevatein (SOS
Overdrive). Climb the stone steps nearby when prompted with an action command
as shown in lower right of screen, then proceed in arrow's direction.

'Sin: Tower of the Dead'
You've reached last save point. Once you enter the tower that just appeared,
there's no turning back...

'Sin: Nucleus'
If you touch ice blades coming out of the ground, you'll enter a battle. Your
goal here is to collect 10 gems that pop around. Each one collected will nail
you: Stillblade, Wicked Cait Sith, Infinity, Prism Ball, White Magic Sp., Skill
Sp., Mage's Staff, Hrunting, Knight Lance, Attribute Sp. Items you get aren't
necessarily in this order. And they all suck except for spheres.

'Sin: Dream's End'
Finally. Make any last weapon/armor changes and commence final battle.

once for 3500 damage. Yu adds that to its damage total. Attack it again for
5500 damage. Yu adds that to its damage total, now totalled at 9000. Yu is
disabled for few turns. When revived, 9000 HP will be Yu's new MAX HP. Yu's
damage total resets to zero. Attack it once for 8500 HP. Yu's damage total is

STRATEGY | 'Punch' does about 2500 damage. Triumphant Grasp does 2000 damage to
one chr two times and inflicts Zombie. Beam does about 1000 damage and
petrifies chr - either you bring Stoneproof armors with you or quickly use
Esuna or Soft on petrified chr. Don't ignore it or you'll have one chr less to
fight with.
Following two attacks need to charge: Triumphant Grasp will strike single chr
twice and inflict Zombie, so you better not forget to heal that. Bomber is used
if Aeon is present in battle.
If both Yu Pagodas are 'alive', they'll use Power Wave on their ally. This'll
restore 1500 HP to him and fill up something. When it's almost full, have Tidus
use Talk command - doing this will cause that something to empty and also
forfeit main boss' next turn. Talk command will be effective only twice. Third
time it is used it won't have any effect anymore.
If Yu Pagoda is under positive status when you shut it offline, that same
status will still be present when Yu goes back online. The same doesn't apply
for negative statuses. If you kill off left Yu, right one will be using Curse
and Osmose. Same applies when killing right Yu. Any status you inflict on Br.
F. Aeon will be cured by Power Wave.
Let's talk battle: Tidus, Yuna and Auron are of course recommended. Tidus uses
Hastega, Yuna Protect and Auron Power Break (continue using Power Break
throughout the battle, cos Power Wave will remove that status. Note that it is
possible to Slow Yu Pagodas - hard to connect, but not impossible (use Silver
or Gold Hourglass). When hit by J. Beam, Esuna or Soft immediately. His
'Punch' will be halved by Protect. When hit with Triumphant Grasp, first cure
zombie status, *then* heal. To get two free chrs to do the attacking, equip one
chr with Stoneproof armor and then have that chr use Provoke on boss. Power
Wave doesn't remove that - yahoo. Beam, Grasp and 'Punch' will all be directed
at Provoker. So what do you do? Two chrs attack relentlessly, while Provoker
only takes care he/she doesn't die.
After we reach second halftime, game gets more dangerous. 'Sword swipe' deals
about 2500 damage to everyone and delays all chrs' next turn as well! Hastega
will be vitally important here. 'Slam' deals about 1200 damage to one chr. Beam
is still used - Soft or Esuna immediately! Get out those Protects. If Provoked
in first half of battle, boss will *still* be affected, but doesn't do you much
good anyway cos of hit-all 'Sword swipe'.
After you knock boss' HP under 60000, be well prepared. This time instead of
Triumphant Grasp (it should be known that Triumphant Grasp used during this
part of battle doesn't inflict Zombie anymore!) you'll see sth else - Almighty
J. Shot - deals about 4500 damage to everyone and is unblockable. Use that Talk
command now! Or as last resort call an aeon and use Shield (I believe that only
Shield can lessen the damage done by special type attacks by 75%).
Killing off Yus sounds a good idea, but I suggest Slowing them down instead. If
you do kill one of them, the other Yu will either Curse you or Osmose you -
both of which are pretty annoying. So either you Slow them or kill them.
Fast way to kill this boss is to make him a Zombie. Then shell out that Hi-
Potions, Mega-Potions and whatnot (X-Potions and Elixirs won't work well).
Sooner or later boss will wave goodbye. Or use Quick Hits. Or Mix 2x Wings to
Discovery. Bye-bye!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

What? Strategy for the very last boss? You really (trust me) do not need one
except for these three tips:
#1 - You're always in Auto-Life status.
#2 - Only way you can lose this battle is if you Petrify yourself.
#3 - Cast Reflect on very final boss.

Sensors of last bosses:
'Strike me down.' V.
'Extinguish me.' I. (absorbs fire)
'End it right here.' I. (absorbs lightning)
'Please... Defeat me.' S. (absorbs ice)
'Soon... Eternal rest.' B.
'Thus I atone.' A.
'Take my life.' Y.
'Stop the suffering.' C.
'Don't cry.' S.
'Gotta say goodbye.' M.
'Possesses aeons.' YY.

Oh well, I guess I can provide you with few infos on last boss: It has 99999 HP
and 1 MP. Boss can be inflicted with following statuses: Doom (will get KO-ed
in 3 turns), Full Break, Zombie, Poison (rips off 10% MAX HP), Slow, Nul
spells, Haste, Protect, Shell, Reflect, Regen, Distil effects.
Attacks it uses are Gravija (with which it hurts itself, too), Osmose (when
it's used, it works on all three chrs), Ultima (you should kinda beware since
you can't halve it with Shell... but why bother? Auto-Life is here to save the
day) and Curaga, which is used as counter to any damage boss sustains from your
chrs' side. Boss sometimes also skips its turn.
Two quick ways to defeat it is casting Reflect on it, then it's just a matter
of time before it goes down. Or zombify it and then use Life spell on it. Bam!
Boss is defeated. BTW, is it just me or does boss' dying sequence make you
remember one scene from Tomb Raider the movie?:) Also, killing this final boss
was so much satisfactory, ever since I had to fight final boss of FFIX (hates
N's guts).

You've just beaten the game. CONGRATULATIONS! And I really mean it. Enjoy the
ending sequence and cross your fingers that the sequel to this great game will
be even in every field if not even surpassing it. Now that you've finished the
game, many challenges still await you. Let me name some:
- Celestial weapons and their upgrades
- Monster Arena
- Chocobo racing
- Secret aeons
- Dark aeons (ONLY in PAL and International version!)
- Statistic maxing
- Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera... Just about anything you need to know is
contained in sections you will find below the walkthrough.

In this section you'll find info on all regular items you can find throughout
the world of FFX. Listed first will be name of item, then what it does and for
items that are harder to come by, also some info on where to get it in big
amounts. I know there are more options available to get certain items, but they
suck in my opinion and/or are waaaay too slow. They tell me I make
incomprehensible lists... okay than, I'll let you have it.

5. Valefor may prove very valuable ally in beginning stages of the game,
especially because of her Sonic Wings, which have Delay effect. Also, as she is
a flying Aeon, some fiends cannot reach her (example: Dual Horns on Highroad).
She doesn't belong to any element, therefore you aren't able to heal her with
elemental spells. In order to obtain her second Overdrive Energy Blast: just
before you're about to leave Besaid Village for the first time, find the girl
with the dog (she's now in item shop) I bet you saw earlier and talk to her
until she says 'that her dog found something'). Go in the third house on the
right of the village and 'talk' to the dog inside. You'll get a special item,
and Valefor gains Energy Blast.
Listed below are three URL-s showing exactly what you must do:
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/valefor01.jpg
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/valefor02.jpg
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/valefor03.jpg
Lately, I've been toying around with various aspects and have discovered
following: if you return to Besaid village after completing Djose temple
trials, enter the shop. Inside you'll find owner's sister together with the
dog. Talk to her and she'll mention that dog gave something to her. She'll give
that something to you instead (Energy Blast learned).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Valefor exceeds 9999 damage limit after you acquire Yuna's Nirvana *and*
power it up with Moon Crest.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
II - IFRIT ---> A747
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. You'll get him after you complete Kilika's Cloister of Trials.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Special attacks:
- Meteor Strike [---> A753] - STATT VS one enemy - std
- Hellfire (Overdrive) [---> A746] - FATT VS all enemies - fire mgd
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Amount of items needed in order to teach new abilities:
For this please look under Valefor's section, where you'll find full and
complete listing.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Items needed in order to raise attributes:
HP, Str and Def  - Power Sphere       | MP, Mag and Mdef - Mana Sphere
Agi, Acc and Eva - Speed Sphere       | Luck             - Fortune Sphere
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Ifrit is fire elemental Aeon, thus allowing you to heal him with fire-based
attacks. This is about his only advantage over Valefor. He's also very useful
for one particular fiend - Jumbo Flan. Ifrit's Meteor Strike is special type
attack, not magical, not physical. I know this is strange, but I have proof.
Jumbo Flan is immune to physicals, and Juggernaut to magicals. Guess what?
Meteor Strike works on both of them. So, in case you're tired of seeing Anima's
Pain, Ifrit is the guy to use.:)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Ifrit exceeds 9999 damage limit after you acquire Wakka's World Champion
*and* power it up with Jupiter Crest.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
III - IXION ---> A749
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. You'll get him after you complete Djose's Cloister of Trials.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Special attacks:
- Aerospark  [---> A736] - VS one enemy - phd + Dispel effect
- Thor's Hammer (Overdrive) [---> A760] - LATT VS all enemies - lightning mgd
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Amount of items needed in order to teach new abilities:
For this please look under Valefor's section, where you'll find full and
complete listing.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Items needed in order to raise attributes:
HP, Str and Def  - Power Sphere       | MP, Mag and Mdef - Mana Sphere
Agi, Acc and Eva - Speed Sphere       | Luck             - Fortune Sphere
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Ixion is much the same league as Ifrit. Ixion is lightning elemental, thus
he can be healed with lightning based attacks. His other useful feature is
Aerospark, as it carries Dispel effect. Otherwise I see no other beneficial
feature which might prompt you to use Ixion often.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Ixion exceeds 9999 damage limit after you acquire Kimahri's Spirit Lance
*and* power it up with Saturn Crest.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
IV - SHIVA ---> A758
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. You'll get her after you defeat S. and his cronies for first time.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Special attacks:
- Heavenly Strike [---> A745] - VS one enemy - phd + delays enemy's next turn
- Diamond Dust (Overdrive) [---> A742] - IATT VS all enemies - ice mgd
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Amount of items needed in order to teach new abilities:
For this please look under Valefor's section, where you'll find full and
complete listing.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Items needed in order to raise attributes:
HP, Str and Def  - Power Sphere       | MP, Mag and Mdef - Mana Sphere
Agi, Acc and Eva - Speed Sphere       | Luck             - Fortune Sphere
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Ah, my *favorite* Aeon. Her being ice elemental means she could use some
icing on the cake... er, I mean she can be healed with ice based attacks. Shiva
also possesses tremendous Agility, which will be main reason you'll want to use
her. And her special attack has Delay effect. Beware of her low HP and Def,
tho'. In a cinch she may fall easily.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Shiva exceeds 9999 damage limit after you acquire Lulu's Onion Knight *and*
power it up with Venus Crest.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
V - BAHAMUT ---> A738
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. You'll get him after you complete Bevelle's Cloister of Trials.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Special attacks:
- Impulse [---> A748] - VS all enemies - phd
- Mega Flare (Overdrive) [---> A752] - STATT VS all enemies - std
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Amount of items needed in order to teach new abilities:
For this please look under Valefor's section, where you'll find full and
complete listing.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Items needed in order to raise attributes:
HP, Str and Def  - Power Sphere       | MP, Mag and Mdef - Mana Sphere
Agi, Acc and Eva - Speed Sphere       | Luck             - Fortune Sphere
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. What the hell did they do to him in this game??? Okay, so he has big Str and
Def, but he has low Agi. His Impulse hits every enemy on the field. But both
this and Mega Flare need long to charge, so careful with them. Bahamut with
Haste learned is a killing machine. He can only be healed by healing magic.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Bahamut doesn't require a certain chr's celestial weapon to exceed 9999
damage limit. He can do so after he's strong enough.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
VI - ANIMA ---> A737
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. You'll get her after you complete Baaj Temple's Cloister of Trials. You must
have opened all six treasures (one in each temple - Besaid, Kilika, Djose,
Macalania, Bevelle and Zanarkand) in order for final seal in Baaj Temple to
disappear.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Special attacks:
- Pain [---> A755] - NATT VS one enemy - mgd + KO
- Oblivion (Overdrive) [---> A754] - STATT VS all enemies - 16 consecutive hits
to all
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Amount of items needed in order to teach new abilities:
For this please look under Valefor's section, where you'll find full and
complete listing.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Items needed in order to raise attributes:
HP, Str and Def  - Power Sphere       | MP, Mag and Mdef - Mana Sphere
Agi, Acc and Eva - Speed Sphere       | Luck             - Fortune Sphere
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Yuck. But very useful. Pain carries KO. Oblivion is strongest attack in the
game. She has big HP and Str. But special attacks take quite long to charge, so
careful planning is needed. Don't forget to teach Anima Haste/ga.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Anima doesn't require a certain chr's celestial weapon to exceed 9999 damage
limit. She can do so after she's strong enough.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
VII - YOJIMBO ---> A763
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. You'll get him after you defeat optional boss in Cavern of S. F.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Special attacks:
- Daigoro [---> A740] - VS one enemy - phd
- Kozuka [---> A750] - VS one enemy - phd
- Wakizashi [---> A762] - VS one enemy OR all enemies - phd
- Zanmato [---> A764] - VS all enemies - instant kill against *any* enemy in
the game
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Amount of items needed in order to teach new abilities:
Yojimbo cannot be taught any abilities.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Items needed in order to raise attributes:
HP, Str and Def  - Power Sphere       | MP, Mag and Mdef - Mana Sphere
Agi, Acc and Eva - Speed Sphere       | Luck             - Fortune Sphere
Note: It is useless to raise Yojimbo's MP and Magic, as he doesn't use them.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Money-eating-machine is the best I can describe this scrooge. He'll take
money from you in order to execute one of his four special attacks. There are
only two commands available for him: Pay and Dismiss. Pick Pay, then choose
amount of Gil you want to give Yojimbo. Depending on how much he 'likes' you
(don't ask, too complicated to explain), he will choose an attack, Daigoro
being the crappiest, and Zanmato being the coolest. Daigoro and Kozuka attack
only one enemy, Wakizashi attacks either one or all enemies, and Zanmato insta-
kills *anything* in the game.
If you pay him 0 gil at any time, he'll Dismiss automatically. Sometimes
Yojimbo acts on his own and will choose an attack without your investment.
Longest I had Yojimbo attack an enemy without me paying was three turns.
Kylie T. reminded me about an interesting tidbit I neglect to mention: if you
pay Yojimbo some gil and he nods his head, this means he'll launch Zanmato. If
however, he shakes his head, this means Daigoro will be used.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Yojimbo exceeds 9999 damage limit after you acquire Auron's Masamune *and*
power it up with Mars Crest.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
VIII - MAGUS SISTERS ---> A751
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. You'll get them after you have Blossom Crown and Flower Scepter *KEY ITEMS*
and after you have obtained Anima and Yojimbo in Remiem Temple. After you've
done all that, examine barred doors in the back of Remiem temple. You'll be
asked to use both Blossom Crown and Flower Scepter. Seals have been broken, so
enter and they're yours.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Special attacks:
- Mindy's Passado [---> A756] - VS one enemy - 15 consecutive hits - phd
- Sandy's Razzia [---> A757] - VS one enemy - phd
- Cindy's Camisade [---> A739] - VS one enemy - phd
- Delta Attack (Overdrive) [---> A741] - STATT VS all enemies - 6 consecutive
hits to all enemies - std - usable only if all three are alive
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Amount of items needed in order to teach new abilities:
Magus Sisters cannot be taught any abilities.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Items needed in order to raise attributes:
HP, Str and Def  - Power Sphere       | MP, Mag and Mdef - Mana Sphere
Agi, Acc and Eva - Speed Sphere       | Luck             - Fortune Sphere
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Strongest aeons in the game, their Overdrive only surpassed by Oblivion.
However, price comes high. As with Yojimbo, you can't control directly what
they will use. You are, however, presented with at least two commands to choose
from. When entered, Sister on the act may either execute an attack or 'Taking a
break...'. I hate it so when that happens.
Mindy: Passado, physical attack, all Lv2 element spells, all Lv3 element
spells, Drain, Death, Bio, Flare, Ultima, Lancet.
Sandy: Razzia, Reflect, Haste, Shell, Protect, physical attack, NulAll.
Cindy: Camisade, physical attack, all Lv3 element spells, Auto-Life, Life,
Full-Life, Pray, Cure, Cura, Curaga, Mighty Guard, Holy.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Magus Sisters don't require a certain chr's celestial weapon to exceed 9999
damage limit. They can do so after they're strong enough.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

*****************************************************************************
3 - LAST MINUTE USEFUL AEON TIPS AND TRICKS
*****************************************************************************

1. List of commands is outlined like this:
- Attack            : launch a physical attack VS targeted enemy
- *Special attack*  : unleash aeon's special attack
- White Magic       : exactly the same as if you were controlling your
                      regular characters
- Black Magic       : exactly the same as if you were controlling your
                      regular characters
- Skill             : exactly the same as if you were controlling your
                      regular characters
- Special           : exactly the same as if you were controlling your
                      regular characters
- Pay (only Yojimbo): pay money to Yojimbo so that he attacks your enemies
- Overdrive         : when aeon's Overdrive gauge is full, press left in
                      command window, then pick the name of Overdrive and let
                      it rip (GO Shiva!)
- Shield            : by pressing right in command window you can access this
                      command, which reduces damage done to aeon until next
                      turn by 75%, but Overdrive gauge doesn't charge
- Boost             : by pressing right in command window you can access this
                      command, which increases damage done to aeon until next
                      turn by 50%, but also charges Overdrive gauge faster
- Dismiss           : by pressing right in command window you can access this
                      command, which sends an aeon away

2. Remember, Ifrit, Shiva and Ixion can also be healed with their natural
element! Ifrit with fire, Shiva with ice and Ixion with lightning.

3. You should teach your aeons following abilities: Full Break, Lancet,
Doublecast, Curaga, Hastega, Slowga, Shell, Protect, Reflect, Dispel, Regen,
Holy, Flare, Ultima.

4. When raising aeon's attributes, take heed that after certain amount of times
item requirement for certain stat may rise by one. For example: Anima needs 50
Power Spheres in order to raise her HP by 100. After you do so for about ten
times, you will need *51 Power Spheres* for next HP improvement. Same applies
for all of 10 statistics. Detailed formulas are further down.
Also note that strength of an aeon is tied to that of the summoner. So,
stronger Yuna gets, stronger aeons get, but there is aeon growth limit, ie a
point behind which aeon's stats will stop growing no matter how much you train
Yuna. The first increase in aeon's stats takes place after the 60th battle from
the time the aeon was first available). From then on, the levels can increase
up to 18 times at 30-battle intervals (thanks to piggyback).

5. If aeon is KO-ed in battle, that aeon will need certain amount of battles
before his/her HP is restored. His/her Ov. gauge is also reset to zero. You can
speed this up by finding a save sphere and examining it. Doing this instantly
revives all aeons and restores everyone's HP/MP.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Valefor       - 8 battles to go      | Ifrit         - 12 battles to go
Ixion         - 20 battles to go     | Shiva         - 20 battles to go
Bahamut       - 24 battles to go     | Yojimbo       - 24 battles to go
Anima         - 24 battles to go     | Magus Sisters - 30 battles to go
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. All aeons have inherent ability of Sensor. Whenever you summon one, you will
see enemy's stats pop up on the screen when targeting that enemy. In addition
to sensor aeons also have innate ability of Piercing (discovered by Terence).

*****************************************************************************
4 - YOJIMBO MATHEMATICS INFORMATOR, NTSC STYLE ---> A848
*****************************************************************************

Note: Information written was permitted to use by Azure Edge!
This is a section where the information lies explaining just how exactly does
game configure the probability of Yojimbo using Zanmato... and the rest of the
attacks.

To start, Yojimbo's attacks are involved with six different factors. They are
motivation, compatibility, gil paid, Zanmato level of the fiend/s, Overdrive
gauge and random factor (like you expected something else, heh).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FACTOR 1 - MOTIVATION
Motivation is most important factor, for it decides what attack Yojimbo will
use. Motivation is a points scale, starting at zero. Higher motivation means
better attack. Zanmato is performed at motivation, that is higher than 80. The
other five factors are used to calculate motivation. After the calculations are
done and if motivation is higher than 80, you'll see Zanmato. If not,
calculations are done again, this time assuming Zanmato level of the fiend is
one.
Basically, first the game will find out if Yojimbo will do Zanmato. If not,
another attack is selected. Motivation is resetted every turn, so if you pay
Yojimbo 5000 gil one turn and 10000 the next, he will only have the motivation
count for that second payment. Because all motivation numbers are whole, in-
game equation rounds by ignoring the decimals.
Outlined below is small chart showing what motivation triggers what attacks:
--> 0 - 31 motivation will trigger Daigoro
--> 32 - 47 motivation will trigger Kozuka
--> 48 - 63 motivation will trigger Wakizashi VS one enemy
--> 64 (and beyond) motivation will trigger Wakizashi VS all enemies
The other five factors add up to Yojimbo's final motivation thus determining
which attack will be used. Discussed below is how these five factors apply to
the attack used.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FACTOR 2 - GIL
Cash paid is nearly as important as motivation. Paying certain amounts of gil
can add up to 56 points of motivation to Yojimbo's overall motivation. How much
gil for how many motivation? This you will see below.

Gil Paid               |   Motivation | Gil Paid               |   Motivation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 to 3                 |            0 | 4 to 7                 |            2
8 to 15                |            4 | 16 to 31               |            6
32 to 63               |            8 | 64 to 127              |           10
128 to 255             |           12 | 256 to 511             |           14
512 to 1023            |           16 | 1024 to 2047           |           18
2048 to 4095           |           20 | 4096 to 8191           |           22
8129 to 16383          |           24 | 16384 to 32767         |           26
32768 to 65535         |           28 | 65536 to 131071        |           30
131072 to 262143       |           32 | 262144 to 524287       |           34
524288 to 1048575      |           36 | 1048576 to 2097151     |           38
2097152 to 4194303     |           40 | 4194304 to 83886007    |           42
83886008 to 16777215   |           44 | 16777216 to 33554431   |           46
33554432 to 67108863   |           48 | 67108864 to 134217727  |           50
134217728 to 268435455 |           52 | 268435456 to 536870911 |           54
536870912 to 999999999 |           56 |                        |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FACTOR 3 - COMPATIBILITY
When you acquire Yojimbo, he starts with a hidden affection for Yuna. Better
watch out, Tidus, hehe. It starts at 50, and can raise all the way up to 255
heaven. The equation for compatibility factor is [c / 30 = m], where c =
compatibility and m = motivation.
Whaaat? Measly +8 motivation for highest compatibility? Sadly it is so. Also,
certain actions, when performed, will raise or lower Yojimbo's compatibility.

'Chart' below will show action performed first, followed by compatibility
change...
--> Pay 0 gil - compatibility drops by 20 points
--> Yojimbo is KO-ed - compatibility drops by 10
--> Yojimbo is dismissed without being payed once - compatibility drops by 3
--> Daigoro is used - compatibility drops by 1
--> Kozuka is used - compatibility is not changed
--> Wakizashi VS one enemy is used - compatibility rises by 1 point
--> Wakizashi VS all enemies is used - compatibility rises by 3
--> Zanmato is used - compatibility rises by 4
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FACTOR 4 - ZANMATO LEVEL
There are five Zanmato Levels, and each fiend is assigned to one, even the
underwater fiends, which you can't Zanmato otherwise. These levels affect the
rate of Zanmato being used on a particular fiend; the higher the Zanmato level,
the lower the Zanmato rate becomes. This is also tied in with the answer you
gave when you hired him, and the motivation from his compatibility. To find out
the effect of Zanmato Level on Yojimbo's motivation, take the motivation added
from his compatibility and apply it to the below formula. For this equation, c
= motivation from compatibility, p = the amount you paid for the attack, and t
= your total amount of gil.

c * (0.75 + [{p * 0.5} / t])

Now, take the solution from the above formula and multiply it into the equation
below, based on the answer you gave Yojimbo when you hired him.

If you hired him to help with your training as a summoner, or if you hired him
to destroy fiends...
Level One - * 1
Level Two - * 0.5
Level Three - * 0.33
Level Four - * 0.25
Level Five - * 0.2

If you hired him to defeat very strong enemies...
Level One to Three - * 0.8
Level Four or Five - * 0.4

Which enemy has what Zanmato level? Their list is below.

--> Zanmato level 1

--> Zanmato level 3
Adamantoise, Anima.

--> Zanmato level 4
All Monster Arena bosses (except Earth Eater, Greater Sphere, Catastrophe,
Th'uban, Ultima Buster and Nemesis), Arms, Braska's Final Aeon, B. Ronso,

--> Zanmato level 5
Earth Eater, Greater Sphere, Catastrophe, Th'uban, Ultima Buster, Nemesis
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FACTOR 5 - OVERDRIVE
This one is quick. If Yojimbo's overdrive gauge is full, this adds 2 points to
his overall motivation.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FACTOR 6 - RANDOM FACTOR
Random factor will always determine whether or not you'll see Zanmato. It
randomly adds anywhere from 0 to 63 points to Yojimbo's overall motivation.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FREE ATTACKS?
There's also a chance that Yojimbo will attack free of charge. If c =
compatibility, the chance is (c / 1024). When he does this, his motivation
calculation is much simpler. If c = compatibility, the formula is (c / 4) + a
random factor of 0 to 63. The result is:
--> 0 - 31 motivation will trigger Daigoro
--> 32 - 47 motivation will trigger Kozuka
--> 48 - 63 motivation will trigger Wakizashi VS one enemy
--> 64 - 79 motivation will trigger Wakizashi VS all enemies
--> 80 (and beyond) will trigger Zanmato

Free Zanmato is used if Zanmato level of the enemy is one. It's the most
economic way of using Yojimbo, but it'll cost you a few truckloads of gil to
get you all the way to 255 compatibility (counts few millions of dead Mimics).
At 255 compatibility Yojimbo attacks for free 25% of the time and uses either
Wakizashi or Zanmato.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXECUTING ZANMATO?
Here are a few tips that may help you increase your chances to see Zanmato:
- Don't let Yojimbo get KO-ed
- Don't pay him zero gil, or dismiss him straight away
- Pay him at least 1000 gil every turn you plan using him
- Keep his overdrive gauge (near) full
- Pay all money you have and hope that randomness is on your side for once
- lastly, investing large amounts of gil until he has 255 compatibility

5 - YOJIMBO MATHEMATICS INFORMATOR, PAL / INTERNATIONAL STYLE ---> A848
*****************************************************************************

Info supplied by Olivier Hague on FFX message board.

It all depends on Yojimbo's Motivation. It starts at 0, naturally. It is
calculated as follows:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FACTOR 1: The money you paid him for the attack
Motivation according to how much you paid him for the attack:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1        ~3 Gil         -> + 0       | 4        ~7 Gil         -> + 4
8        ~15 Gil        -> + 8       | 16       ~31 Gil        -> + 12
32       ~63 Gil        -> + 16      | 64       ~127 Gil       -> + 20
128      ~255 Gil       -> + 24      | 256      ~511 Gil       -> + 28
512      ~1023 Gil      -> + 32      | 1024     ~2047 Gil      -> + 36
2048     ~4095 Gil      -> + 40      | 4096     ~8191 Gil      -> + 44
8192     ~16383 Gil     -> + 48      | 16384    ~32767 Gil     -> + 52
32768    ~65535 Gil     -> + 56      | 65536    ~131071 Gil    -> + 60
131072   ~262143 Gil    -> + 64      | 262144   ~524287 Gil    -> + 68
524288   ~1048575 Gil   -> + 72      | 1048576  ~2097151 Gil   -> + 76
2097152  ~4194303 Gil   -> + 80      | 4194304  ~83886007 Gil  -> + 84
8388608  ~16777215 Gil  -> + 88      | 16777216 ~33554431 Gil  -> + 92
33554432 ~67108863 Gil  -> + 96      | 67108864 ~134217727 Gil -> + 100
134217728~268435455 Gil -> + 104     | 268435456~536870911 Gil -> + 108
536870912~999999999 Gil -> + 112     |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FACTOR 2: The Compatibility parameter
This hidden parameter starts at 128. The minimum is 0, and the max is 255.
It decreases by 20 points if you pay him 0 Gil.
It decreases by 10 points if Yojimbo is KO-ed during battle.
It decreases by 3 points if you dismiss him just after you summoned him.
It decreases by 1 point when he attacks with Daigoro.
It doesn't change when he uses Kozuka.
It increases by 1 point when he uses Wakizashi VS one enemy.
It increases by 3 points when he uses Wakizashi VS all enemies.
It increases by 4 points when he uses Zanmato.
It doesn't reset when the battle is over.

Yojimbo's motivation according to his compatibility parameter when you paid him
for the attack:
+ (Compatibility / 4)
(round off by ignoring what's after the comma)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FACTOR 3: Your answer when you hired him, and the Zanmato Lv. of the enemy

You chose you wanted to hire him as a part of your training as a Summoner:
X [0.75 + (what you paid for the attack X 0.5 / the total amount of Gil you
have)]
(round off by ignoring what's after the comma)

You chose you wanted to hire him as a part of your training as a Summoner, or
to destroy fiends:
Enemy is Zanmato Lv. 1 -> X 1
Enemy is Zanmato Lv. 2 -> X 0.5
Enemy is Zanmato Lv. 3 -> X 0.33
Enemy is Zanmato Lv. 4 -> X 0.25
Enemy is Zanmato Lv. 5 -> X 0.2
Enemy is Zanmato Lv. 6 -> X 0.16
(round off by ignoring what's after the comma)

You chose you wanted to hire him to defeat really strong enemies:
Enemy is Zanmato Lv. 1~3 -> X 0.8
Enemy is Zanmato Lv. 4~6 -> X 0.4
(round off by ignoring what's after the comma)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FACTOR 4: The Overdrive gauge
If it was full when you paid him for the attack: + 20
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FACTOR 5: The random factor
That one is random: it can be anywhere between + 0-63
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FACTOR 6: So, how much does that make?
If, after all that, Yojimbo's motivation is equal or superior to 80, he'll use
Zanmato. If it isn't, the whole calculation will be made one more time, but the
enemy's Zanmato Lv. will be considered to be 1 this time. And according to the
new Motivation result...
0~31 -> Daigoro
32~47 -> Kozuka
48~63 -> Wakizashi (one enemy)
64+ -> Wakizashi (all enemies)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FREE ATTACK?
Yojimbo may also immediately attack for free when his turn comes. Odds are:
Compatibility parameter / 1024

When he does attack for free, the kind of attack he does is decided as follows:
[Compatibility parameter / 4] (round off by ignoring what's after the comma) +
0~63 (random)
If the result is:
0~31 -> Yojimbo uses Daigoro
32~47 -> Yojimbo uses Kozuka
48~63 -> Yojimbo uses Wakizashi VS one enemy
64~79 -> Yojimbo uses Wakizashi VS all enemies
80+ -> Yojimbo uses Zanmato if the enemy's Zanmato Lv. is 1, otherwise, he uses
Wakizashi VS all enemies

XVII) ABOUT OVERDRIVES
=============================================================================
=============================================================================

*****************************************************************************
1 - TIDUS' OVERDRIVE - SWORDPLAY ---> A582
*****************************************************************************

Press button at the right time for extra damage!
Once Tidus' Ov. gauge is full, press left in command window. A bar with
brighter middle part will appear with fast moving marker moving across. You
want to stop this marker while it's over that bright part to inflict additional
damage. Also the quicker you are, the greater the damage.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A - Spiral cut (3 seconds timer) ---> A555
Unsuccessful stop - VS one enemy, 1 strike with attack power 24
Successful stop   - VS one enemy, 1 strike with attack power 32
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
B - Slice & Dice (3 seconds timer) ---> A520
Unsuccessful stop - VS 1-3 enemies, 3 strikes randomly distributed among
                    enemies with attack power 8
Successful stop   - VS 1-4 enemies, 6 strikes randomly distributed among
                    enemies with attack power 6
Note              - learned once you use previous Overdrive 10 times,
                    regardless of success
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
C - Energy Rain (3 seconds timer) ---> A179
Unsuccessful stop - VS all enemies, 1 strike with attack power 20
Successful stop   - VS all enemies, 1 strike with attack power 26
Note              - learned once you use previous two Overdrives 30 times,
                    regardless of success
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
D - Blitz Ace (2 seconds timer) ---> A064
Unsuccessful stop - VS one enemy, 8 strikes with attack power 4
Successful stop   - VS one enemy, 8 strikes with attack power 4, and then 1
                    strike with attack power 24
Note              - learned once you use previous Overdrives 80 times,
                    regardless of success
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

*****************************************************************************
2 - YUNA'S OVERDRIVE - GRAND SUMMON ---> A237
*****************************************************************************

Summon an Aeon in Overdrive!
Once Yuna's Ov. gauge is full, press left in command window. Yuna can now use
Grand Summon. Select an Aeon you want. Aeon she'll summon will come to battle
with full Overdrive, instantly ready to be launched. The other cool catch is
that if Aeon had full Overdrive prior to Grand Summon, he gets to keep it,
meaning you can unleash two Mega Flares in a row, for example.

*****************************************************************************
3 - LULU'S OVERDRIVE - FURY ---> A225
*****************************************************************************

Unleash a barrage of spells on the enemy!
Once Lulu's Ov. gauge is full, press left in command window. Pick Fury, then
select the spell you want to use. Now rotate right analog stick as fast as you
can. The more circles you successfully complete, the more number on screen will
rise. Once time limit elapses, chosen spell will be thrown at the enemies. The
harder the spell, the more circles you need to accomplish for one successful
casting. Two good things about it are that it penetrates enemy's Reflect and is
not affected by Shell. Bad thing is that damage done is merely a fraction of
what it could be were it cast alone. Here's the order of spells as they're
listed in Lulu's Overdrive screen:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fire Fury (attack power 5)           | Thunder Fury (attack power 5)
Water Fury (attack power 5)          | Blizzard Fury (attack power 5)
Fira Fury (attack power 10)          | Thundara Fury (attack power 10)
Watera Fury (attack power 10)        | Blizzara Fury (attack power 10)
Firaga Fury (attack power 18)        | Thundaga Fury (attack power 18)
Waterga Fury (attack power 18)       | Blizzaga Fury (attack power 18)
Bio Fury                             | Demi Fury
Death Fury                           | Drain Fury (attack power 9)
Osmose Fury (attack power 4)         | Flare Fury (attack power 22)
Ultima Fury (attack power 28)        |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes about Lulu's Furies:
- Bio Fury has up to 80% chance of inflicting Poison
- Demi Fury reduces current HP by 12,5%
- Death Fury has up to 80% chance of inflicting Death
- Fury's maximum is *sixteen* spells
- available Furies appear as soon as Lulu learns the respective Black Magic

*****************************************************************************
4 - WAKKA'S OVERDRIVE - SLOTS ---> A521
*****************************************************************************

Get the right combination for the ultimate shot!
Once Wakka's Ov. gauge is full, press left in command window. Slot machine will
appear. His Overdrive is called Slots. Depending on type of reels you've
obtained so far you can choose from following:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A - Element Reels ---> A177
These are Wakka's primary reels you'll have from the time he joins your party.
Once selected, you'll have 20 secs to line up colors of the orbs. There's four
kinds of them, each one for respective elemental damage: red for fire, blue for
water, yellow for lightning and white for ice.
There's multiple outcomes you may get depending on what was lined up. I'll
explain them:
- if you line up three red orbs successfully, Wakka will perform fire elemental
physical attack VS all enemies with attack power 34 (same applies if you line
up three blue, yellow or white orbs respectively)
- if you line up say two red and one blue orb, Wakka will perform fire
elemental physical attack VS one random enemy with attack power 34 (same
applies for various other combinations)
- if you line up say one red, one blue and one yellow orb, Wakka will perform
an ordinary physical attack VS one random enemy for critical damage with attack
power 34
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
B - Attack Reels ---> A028
These are second reels Wakka can use and surprisingly, they're the best out of
all four he can joke around with. Attack Reels may appear as a prize in
Blitzball Tournament. Picture proving that available at:
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/attackreels.jpg
Once you take Attack Reels for a spin, you have 20 secs to select among three
choices: 1x hit, 2x hit, or Miss. Likewise, multiple outcomes are possible.
- if you line up say '1x hit, 2x hit and Miss', Wakka will launch three
physical attacks randomly distributed among all enemies on the screen
- if you line up say '1x hit, 2x hit and 2x hit', Wakka will launch five
physical attacks randomly distributed among all enemies on the screen
- if you line up say '1x hit, 1x hit and 1x hit', Wakka will launch six
physical attacks randomly distributed among all enemies on the screen
- if you line up say '2x hit, 2x hit and 2x hit', Wakka will launch twelve(!)
physical attacks randomly distributed among all enemies on the screen - this is
the best outcome you can wish for
- attack power taken into account is amount of hits multiplied by 10
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
C - Status Reels ---> A563
These are third reels for Wakka... the least useful as well. Status Reels may
appear as a prize in Blitzball League. Picture proving that available at:
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/statusreels.jpg
Once you take Status Reels for a spin, you have 20 secs to select among three
choices: 'Down' symbol, 'skull' symbol and... errr, 'sandclock' symbol. Yet
again, multiple outcomes possible.
- if you line up three 'Down'-s successfully, Wakka will perform one physical
attack VS all enemies with attack power 34 and inflict Full Break at the same
time (if you complete 'skull'-s, enemies will be inflicted with Poison, Sleep,
Silence and Darkness; by lining up three 'sandclock'-s, Wakka will try to
launch an attack which petrifies all enemies)
- if you line up say two 'Down'-s and one 'skull', Wakka will launch a physical
attack (carries Full Break as well) against one random enemy with attack power
34 (same applies for various other combinations)
- if you line up one of each symbol, Wakka will perform an ordinary physical
attack VS one random enemy for critical damage with attack power 34
- Wakka must appear in at least 250 battles against fiends before Status Reels
become a prize
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
D - Aurochs Reels ---> A030
Last reels for Wakka and useless as well. They may appear as Tournament prize.
Picture proving that available at:
http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/aurochsreels.jpg
Aurochs reels are combination of Element and Status Reels. Each slot is
comprised of following symbols: red, blue, yellow and white orbs, 'skull',
'sandclock', 'Down' and three Aurochs symbols per one slot.
Once activated, you have 20 seconds to line up the symbols. A myriad of
outcomes is possible again. For lining up orbs and symbols look a bit above,
but I do need to mention two outcomes:
- if you line up say two red orbs and one 'Down', this will no longer cause
fire elemental attack VS one random enemy - instead one random enemy is hit for
critical damage
- if you line up three Aurochs symbols, all enemies get hit once with attack
power 72
- Wakka must appear in at least 450 battles against fiends before Aurochs Reels
become a prize
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

*****************************************************************************

commands. If successful, additional effects are added to the attack - however,
if your opponent is immune to the additional effect, the status neutral
'variant' will automatically be used to attack (thanks to piggyback for this).
Also the quicker you are, the greater the damage.

*****************************************************************************
1 - OVERDRIVE MODES - CHART OVERVIEW
*****************************************************************************

This section covers all the different Overdrive modes. In here you'll be able
to learn conditions under which a character learns one mode, how many times
must the character be in that condition and how many turns must character spend
in that Overdrive mode for his/her gauge to fill up completely.
First you'll see name of the mode, then what type of action fills the gauge,
when does the mode become available, and lastly how many turns and/or whatever
else is needed for OD gauge to fill up. So far 17 Overdrive modes have been
discovered.

                        way, find what it is here

*****************************************************************************
3 - OVERDRIVE MODES - IN-DEPTH OVERVIEW
*****************************************************************************

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#1 - STOIC ---> A565 - when character receives damage
Learned when? - Initially available
Fills how? - Damage received x 30 / MAX HP
Fast way to obtain this mode? - None, since you already start with it
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#2 - WARRIOR ---> A620 - when chr damages enemy (NOT by Overdrives or items)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Learned when?     | Tidus    - 150   | Yuna     - 200   | Wakka    - 160
Lulu     - 300    | Kimahri  - 120   | Auron    - 100   | Rikku    - 140
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fills how? - Damage inflicted x 10 / Estimated Damage (*3), maximum 16
Fast way to obtain this mode? - No fast way but to fight lots of battles and
you'll learn it eventually
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#3 - COMRADE ---> A102 - when chr's allies take damage
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Learned when?     | Tidus    - 300   | Yuna     - 240   | Wakka    - 100
Lulu     - 100    | Kimahri  - 100   | Auron    - 220   | Rikku    - 100
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fills how? - Damage received x 20 / Target's MAX HP
Fast way to obtain this mode? - No fast way but to fight lots of battles and
you'll learn it eventually
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#4 - HEALER ---> A252 - when chr heals allies
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Learned when?     | Tidus    - 80    | Yuna     - 60    | Wakka    - 100
Lulu     - 170    | Kimahri  - 100   | Auron    - 200   | Rikku    - 70
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fills how? - Healing amount x 16 / Target's Max HP
Fast way to obtain this mode? - Engage in battle against Magic Pot. Have chr
who wants to learn Healer (chr A) know Pray. Someone else (chr B) knows Demi.
Chr B casts Demi over your party so your HP is reduced by 1/4. Chr A now uses
Pray to restore HP to two chrs at once.
I've been informed that actually you don't need to heal a damaged ally, which
means that using Pray over and over on your allies (even those that are in top
shape) will get you Healer mode.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#5 - TACTICIAN ---> A583 - chr inflicts status on the target (*1)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Learned when?     | Tidus    - 75    | Yuna     - 100   | Wakka    - 80
Lulu     - 75     | Kimahri  - 60    | Auron    - 110   | Rikku    - 90
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fills how? - for one successful status attack gauge fills per 16%
Fast way to obtain this mode? - Select any Flan enemy, let's choose Flame Flan.
For chr A customize a weapon with Firestrike and Silencestrike. Chr B knows
Esuna. Engage VS Flame Flan (kill other enemies around it). Chr A attacks Flame
Flan, who gets Silenced, but not killed since we have Firestrike weapon. Chr B
uses Esuna on that Flan to cure Silence. Repeat as needed until chr A learns
Tactician.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#6 - DANCER ---> A117 - when chr evades physical attack
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Learned when?     | Tidus    - 250   | Yuna     - 200   | Wakka    - 200
Lulu     - 300    | Kimahri  - 130   | Auron    - 200   | Rikku    - 200
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fills how? - for each successful evasion gauge fills per 16%
Fast way to obtain this mode? - Once your Eva is high enough so that most of
physical attacks miss, find an enemy who has only physical attacks. I'd suggest
fighting a battle with 3x Yowie in Cavern of S. F. Have all frontline members
who will learn Dancer know Provoke (have Stoneproof just in case). Start
battle, cast Hastega over Yowies, Slowga on yourself, then have each chr
Provoke his/her Yowie. After required number of turns Dancer is learned.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#7 - AVENGER ---> A041 - when chr's allies are KO-ed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Learned when?     | Tidus    - 100   | Yuna     - 80    | Wakka    - 100
Lulu     - 150    | Kimahri  - 100   | Auron    - 120   | Rikku    - 90
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fills how? - for each successful ally's KO gauge fills per 30%
Fast way to obtain this mode? - Provoking Master Coeurl (found in Omega Ruins)
guarantees a KO, since Provoked Master C. uses Blaster, which carries instant
death effect. So keep doing it and soon you'll have Avenger. You can save turns
reviving if two of frontline members have Auto-Phoenix.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#8 - SLAYER ---> A510 - when chr defeats an enemy
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Learned when?     | Tidus    - 100   | Yuna     - 110   | Wakka    - 90
Lulu     - 130    | Kimahri  - 120   | Auron    - 80    | Rikku    - 100

Fast way to obtain this mode? - No fast way but to kill lots of enemies and
you'll learn it eventually
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

or 10,000+ HP
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Learned when?     | Tidus    - 50    | Yuna     - 50    | Wakka    - 50
Lulu     - 70     | Kimahri  - 45    | Auron    - 40    | Rikku    - 50
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fills how? - for each such successful kill gauge fills per 20%
Fast way to obtain this mode? - Go for the enemies that have over 10000 HP. Two
places that are crawling with such enemies are Omega Ruins and final dungeon.
Keep killing them and hope you won't get bored.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

party benefit from this!)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Learned when?     | Tidus    - 120   | Yuna     - 150   | Wakka    - 160
Lulu     - 200    | Kimahri  - 120   | Auron    - 200   | Rikku    - 140

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fills how? - for each successful escape gauge fills per 10%

you'll learn it eventually (if you select Flee, one turn is awarded to all
three frontline chrs)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#12 - ALLY ---> A018 - when chr gets a turn

Lulu     - 45     | Kimahri  - 90    | Auron    - 35    | Rikku    - 170

Lulu     - 120    | Kimahri  - 120   | Auron    - 120   | Rikku    - 120
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fills how? - for each successful 'deflection' gauge fills per 10%
Fast way to obtain this mode? - For chr you want to learn Rook for make an
armor with Auto-Shell and Auto-Protect. Then fight any enemy you want, as long
as this enemy can hit you with either physical or magic attack. FYI, I had Yuna
learn Rook while fighting Penance. He used Obliteration against me, and Yuna
learned Rook after this attack (she had Auto-Protect in her armor).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#17 - VICTIM ---> A614 - hit by negative status (*2) from an enemy
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Learned when?     | Tidus    - 100   | Yuna     - 80    | Wakka    - 100
Lulu     - 110    | Kimahri  - 130   | Auron    - 120   | Rikku    - 90
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fills how? - for each successful attack versus your chr gauge fills per 16%
Fast way to obtain this mode? - This one can be hard. Most appropriate enemies
to learn this mode from are Malboro, Ochu or Mandragora, all of which can
inflict multiple statuses. Get an armor with Confuseproof, Berserkproof and
Poisonproof. The other statuses are manageable. Fight any of these fiends and
wait until they throw their stuff at you. After statuses are inflicted, use
Esuna. Repeat as needed.
Don E. has sent me a great way to attain Victim mode. At the same time you're
Provoking Master Coeurls and learning Avenger mode, you're also having KO-ed
chrs' Victim counter slowly raising. Why? It appears that Death status is also
considered to be one of statuses that counts towards learning Victim. So that
means that as soon as Tidus has been killed 100 times by Blaster, he'll learn
Victim mode.

XXIII) ABOUT STEAL ---> A852
=============================================================================
=============================================================================

Q - What's this section about?
A - About stealing, of course. Listed below will be two charts. First will be
alphabetical chart of every enemy in the game you can steal items from -
naturally what and amount of items will be added as well.
Then I'll reverse the magic - first will be items listed alphabetically, then
all enemies you can steal certain item from will be listed.

Q - How do I get Steal?
A - Rikku initially starts with it. You can have other chrs learn it by
travelling all the way to Steal node (or simply use Warp Sphere), where they
use Ability Sphere to learn Steal, or you use Special Sphere or Master Sphere
in order to learn Steal from anywhere on the grid.

Q - What's Mug?
A - I'm sure you remember that ability from previous FFs.:) When executed, chr
will try to steal and at same time deal damage to the enemy as well.

Q - What is success rate of Steal / Mug?
A - You can steal first item with 100% success. Each additional item has 50%
less chance to be stolen. That means success % goes like this: 100%, 50%,
25%... understood? It is believed that enemy has infinite supply of items that
can be stolen.

Q - I got two different kinds of items from same enemy. What's up?
A - That's because most of the enemies carry two types of items to be stolen.
One is common, the other is rare.

Q - Common items suck. I want rare ones!
A - For this matter one must equip Pickpocket or Master Thief armors.

Q - What do they do and how do I get those?
A - Pickpocket increases chances of stealing rare items. You will still steal
common ones, but at lower rate. To get Pickpocket ability, you need 30x Amulet
(to get Amulets, Bribe Tonberry or kill Stratoavis).
Master Thief allows you to steal rare items only. Likewise you need 30x
Pendulum to get one Master Thief armor (to get Pendulums, Bribe Ultima Weapon
or Master Tonberry, or you can kill Neslug repeatedly).

XXIV) ABOUT BRIBE ---> A853
=============================================================================
=============================================================================

Q - What's this section about?
A - About Bribing, of course. Listed below will be two charts. First will be
alphabetical chart of every enemy in the game you can Bribe for items - added
will also be amount of gil needed as well as an estimate number of items you
will receive should Bribe succeed. Then I'll reverse the magic - first will be
items listed alphabetically, then all enemies you can Bribe for certain item.

Q - How do I get Bribe?
A - It's on the end of Rikku's path. You can have other chrs learn it by
travelling all the way to Bribe node (or you simply use Warp Sphere), where
they use Ability Sphere to learn Steal, or you use Special Sphere or Master
Sphere in order to learn Steal from anywhere on the grid.

Q - How much gil do I need to pay?
A - Read the following info carefully.
For PAL version recommended Bribe amount is fiend's MAX HP multiplied by 10.
For NTSC version recommended Bribe amount is fiend's MAX HP multiplied by 20.
I dunno about very first release of FFX and International version.

Q - What is success rate of Bribe?
A - First take a look at fiend's HP. Multiply the amount by 10 (or 20) and you
have the amount you need to pay (it'll be listed in here as well, so why
bother?:)). Let's say you try to Bribe Malboro. For first bribing try 270001
gil. That's 10x times Malboro's MAX HP + 1. If Malboro goes away after that,
cool! You did it. If it'll say 'Miss', keep giving 1 gil and 1 gil only.
Eventually you will succeed.

Q - I didn't get as many of this item from that enemy as last time I Bribed it.
What's up with that?
A - Amount of items you get is often randomly determined. I will offer info on
estimated amount of item you'd receive should you decide to Bribe the fiend in
case you offer '10x fiend's MAX HP' gil (or 20x times for NTSC).

Q - Can I improve amount of items I get?
A - Aside from increasing amount of gil, no.

Q - This fiend/item is not listed in your list... did you forget it?
A - If you can't find certain fiend or item to be put on display in these two
lists, it means only one thing: this enemy can't be Bribed, or this item cannot
be obtained thru Bribing.

*****************************************************************************
ALPHABETICAL MONSTER LIST
*****************************************************************************

NOTE 1: The amount of gil given and items received listed is legit for PAL
version. If you have NTSC version and you're reading this, you must double the
amount of gil that is displayed near fiend's name (Remember? Fiend's MAX HP x
20 for NTSC). You will also receive roughly twice the amount of items.
NOTE 2: If you don't find the enemy you're looking for, there is one simple
explanation. That enemy doesn't have anything to be bribed for.

XXV) ABOUT DROP ITEMS ---> A854
=============================================================================
=============================================================================

Q - What's this section about?
A - About items you get when you kill an enemy (normal or Overkill). Listed
below will be two charts. First will be alphabetical chart of every enemy in
the game that can be defeated for items, which you obtain by viewing post-
battle screen (ie the one where you view AP gained, weapons obtained etc.).
Then I'll reverse the magic - first will be items listed alphabetically, then
all enemies you can defeat for those items.

Q - Anything of utmost importance?
A - Yes. You can often get double amount of items when you Overkill an enemy.
Overkill means that you gave your enemy a finishing blow that dealt damage
which exceeded Overkill limit for that fiend. Here's an example:
You kill Master Tonberry with a blow dealing 9999 damage. You'd get 1x Teleport
Sphere. Overkill limit for Mr T. is 13560 damage. So if you kill Master
Tonberry with blow dealing say 20000 damage, word Overkill will appear, meaning
you exceeded Overkill limit, in which case you'll receive 2x Teleport Sphere.

Q - I received Power Spheres from Master T., but you wrote it drops Teleport
Spheres... what's up?
A - Some of the enemies, bosses included, drop two different kinds of items.
One is common drop, the other is rare.

Q - Are there any variables that work in my favor of getting only rare drops?
A - Except having a little bit of luck on your part (this doesn't include Luck
stat of your chrs), there is nothing you can do to increase your bets in
getting rare drops.

Q - This fiend/item is not listed in your list... did you forget it?
A - If you can't find certain fiend or item to be put on display in these two
lists, it means only one thing: this enemy doesn't drop anything, or this item
cannot be obtained as battle spoils from any fiend.

In this section I'll list down cases, in which once a certain ability is added
on a weapon, you won't be able to add some other abilities. If you try to do
so, it'll say 'Superior ability already present'. It is possible to add lesser
ability, and then superior one (for example, you can add Darktouch and then
Darkstrike; but it isn't possible to do so in reverse).

- if you add Silencestrike before Silencetouch, latter can't be added
- if you add Sleepstrike before Sleeptouch, latter can't be added
- if you add Poisonstrike before Poisontouch, latter can't be added

- if you add Deathstrike before Deathtouch, latter can't be added
- if you add Zombiestrike before Zombietouch, latter can't be added

In this section I'll list down cases, in which once a certain ability is added
on an armor, you won't be able to add some other abilities. If you try to do
so, it'll say 'Superior ability already present'. It is possible to add lesser
ability, and then superior one (for example, you can add Darkward and then
Darkp.; but it isn't possible to do so in reverse).

- if you add *p. before *ward, latter can't be added
- if you add * E. before *p./*ward, latter can't be added
- if you add Darkp. before Darkward, latter can't be added
- if you add Silencep. before Silenceward, latter can't be added
- if you add Sleepp. before Sleepward, latter can't be added
- if you add Poisonp. before Poisonward, latter can't be added
- if you add Stonep. before Stoneward, latter can't be added
- if you add Deathp. before Deathward, latter can't be added
- if you add Zombiep. before Zombieward, latter can't be added
- if you add Slowp. before Slowward, latter can't be added
- if you add Confusep. before Confuseward, latter can't be added
- if you add Berserkp. before Berserkward, latter can't be added
- if you add A-** before SOS **, latter can't be added
- if you add Master Thief before Pickpocket, latter can't be added
- if you add Ribbon, you can't add Darkward/p., Silenceward/p., Sleepward/p.,
Poisonward/p., Stoneward/p., Zombieward/p., Slowward/p., Confuseward/p.,
Berserkward/p. afterwards

XXXII) ABOUT BLITZBALL ---> A833
=============================================================================
=============================================================================

*****************************************************************************
1) BLITZBALL INTRODUCTION
*****************************************************************************

A blitz team consists of five players and a goalie. Players are LF (left
forward), RF (right forward), MF (midfielder), LD (left defence) and RD (right
defence).
Whenever you play blitz game, you will see an overhead map in lower right
corner of the screen. It shows all players on the field and direction they're
currently facing. Your team is represented with green arrows, the opposite with
red arrows. Ball carrier is marked with a circled arrow. Note that goalies are
not shown on the overhead map.
One game of blitzball consists of two halftimes, each 5 minutes long, 10
minutes in total. League games can end in a tie, whilst tournament and
exhibition games go into overtime/s (also last 5 minutes). If latter happens,
team that scores first (so called golden goal rule) wins the game.
Your objective is to win the game by getting the ball in opposing team's goal,
which is always located on the *left* side of the pool, and to score more goals
than opposing team by the end of the match. At the same time you must prevent
the opposing team from winning. Your team's goal is always located on *right*
side of the pool.

Other 'items' that are to be found on screen whenever you play blitz game:
- stats of player currently in possession of the ball in upper left
- game score in lower right (beneath overhead map)
- game commentary in lower left
- action command in upper left

*****************************************************************************
2) BLITZBALL STATISTICS
*****************************************************************************

Each player has eight attributes. There's a maximum of 9999 HP, while the other
seven stats have a maximum of 99 value.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
HP - Health Points
The most important statistic (like usual, heh). HP drops when player has the
ball. You also need specific amounts of HP for most of the moves, attacks and
whatever there's left. If you don't have enough HP to perform a move, then you
cannot use that move. Should player's HP be totally depleted, this causes a
stat drop, making the player 9/10 less useful as before. HP regenerates when
player doesn't have the ball.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SP - Speed
Get this stat high and not even Sonic can catch you... oops, wrong game (too
much Gamecube). High speed dictates the swimming speed of a player. The higher
it is, faster you can escape your pursuers or catch up with opposing player.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
AT - Attack
This stat dictates how strong the player is in direct encounters. Attack stat
comes into count when player tackles another player (usually one with the
ball), should that player choose breaking. Tackling player's AT is compared to
breaking player's EN. If AT is higher then EN, breaking player loses the ball.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
EN - Endurance
This stat dictates how well the player fares in direct encounters. Endurance
stat comes into count when player with ball comes into encounter and chooses
breaking, while other player tackles. Breaking's EN is compared to tackling's
AT. If EN is higher, player breaks thru.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
PA - Pass
Stat determines how well a player can pass the ball to team players. High PA
also takes care of ball not being caught or deflected by opposing players (they
can still get a hand on it making PA drop a bit, but if PA is high as mentioned
above, the decrease will be insignificant). PA slowly drops as ball travels
thru water. If it reaches zero before it is caught... ooops. Better make passes
from nearer positions.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BL - Block
Countermeasure to PA and SH (described below). If ball player decides to pass
or shoot in encounter, BL comes into picture. IF BL is higher than PA or SH,
ball is caught.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SH - Shoot
Determines player's ability to shoot the ball. Be aware that shot ball's SH
will decrease as it travels thru water. If any defending players get their hand
on the ball, SH drops even more. Last hazard is goalie's CA. If CA is higher
than ball's SH when it's near the goal, the ball is caught or fumbled. If SH is
still higher, you'll score a goal.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CA - Catch
It means everything to a goalie. Take it away from him and you'll have no
worries. Not true for your own goalie, heh. As written above, if CA is higher
than ball's SH at the precisely right time, ball is caught and you'll spare
yourself a goal.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

*****************************************************************************
3) MOVING AROUND
*****************************************************************************

There are three modes of movement. Default mode is Auto, which means that
players move around the pool automatically. This is not recommended mode.
You'll be a lot more successful if you choose Manual A mode (you can access
which movement mode you want to employ by pressing Triangle). Oh, and use left
analog stick for moving around, it'll be much simpler then using D-pad. Only
the ball carrier is moved by you, all others still remain in Auto mode. If at
any time you feel like you don't know where a certain player is, check his/her
position in an overhead map.
Hah, even though the tutorial recommends manual A mode for veteran players,
ignore that advice. As soon as you can, switch from Auto to Manual A. Then
there's Manual B mode... which sucks too if you try to use D-pad.
I highly recommend you stick to Manual A mode and use left analog stick.

Remember this: Movement modes are only applicable if your team is on the
offence, ie one of your players has the ball. If your team is on defence,
movement mode automatically switches to Auto.

*****************************************************************************
4) ACTION MENU
*****************************************************************************

Just swimming around the pool will not get you goals. You must select a command
to tell your players to do so.
You can access action menu by pressing Square anytime one of your players has
the ball. When Square is pressed, action menu appears in upper left corner. It
will usually have three commands you can choose from:
- Pass: select this and you will then be presented with a list of your
teammates you can pass the ball to (goalie can't be selected); select target
player to receive the ball and confirm with X; ball carrier will then attempt
to make a pass to the ball receiver
- Shoot: select this and ball carrier will attempt to score a goal from his/her
current position
- Dribble: closes the action menu and allows ball carrier to resume swimming

Don't forget that time is stopped while action menu is open! That means you
don't have to rush making awkward decisions in the process, but have all the
time to carefully consider what could your next move be.

*****************************************************************************
5) PASSING
*****************************************************************************

As you swim around the pool, notice the stat bar of ball carrier. Stat bar is
located in upper left corner.

Tidus 100HP 9EN 10PA 10SH

As you swim (ie dribbling), your HP slowly decreases. And you decide to make a
pass. Press Square to open action menu. Once you do that, this window will
appear...

Action Commands
Pass   10 HP
Shoot  10 HP
Dribble

Notice HP costs to the right of commands 'Pass' and 'Shoot'? This denotes how
much player's HP will be spent to make that action. As Tidus' PA stat is 10,
'Pass' command will require 10 HP. In short, HP cost for any player to make a
pass is whatever value that player's PA is.
Select Pass. 10 HP will be deducted from Tidus' HP...

Tidus 90HP 9EN 10PA

...and new window appears...

Pass to:
Datto
Letty
Jassu
Botta

This window requires you to select target teammate to receive a pass. Help
yourself with overhead map: ball carrier is marked with circled white arrow,
and ball receiver will be marked by circled green arrow. Note that you cannot
make passes to your team's goalie. Point the arrow to Jassu' name and upper
right corner will show another stat bar, this one belonging to ball receiver:

Tidus 90HP 9EN 10PA
Jassu 75HP 10AT 10PA 1SH

Press X to complete the pass. Tidus will not throw the ball with 10 PA. Notice
how ball's PA will decrease as it travels thru the water. If ball's PA is still
at least 1 as it reaches Jassu, pass will be successful. However, if ball's PA
becomes zero, Jassu will fumble the ball. If latter happens, any other player
can claim the ball. Enemy players are more likely to succeed.
The higher PA stat, the longer passes you can make.

*****************************************************************************
6) SHOOTING
*****************************************************************************

As you swim around, you decide to make a shot. Press Square to open action
menu. Once you do that, this window will appear...

Action Commands
Pass   10 HP
Shoot  10 HP
Dribble

Notice HP costs to the right of commands 'Pass' and 'Shoot'? This denotes how
much player's HP will be spent to make that action. As Tidus' SH stat is 10,
'Shoot' command will require 10 HP. In short, HP cost for any player to make a
shot is whatever value that player's SH is.
Point the arrow at Shoot. Another stat bar will appear in upper right, this one
belonging to opposing team's goalie.

Tidus 100HP 9EN 10SH
Raudy 80HP       8CA

Note that Raudy's 8 CA will be compared to Tidus' 10 SH. Confirm the choice
with X and Tidus will shoot the ball with 10 SH. Notice how ball's SH will
decrease as it travels thru the water. If ball's SH is still at least 1 as it
reaches the goalie, it still stands a chance to go in and score a goal.
However, if ball's SH becomes zero, opposing goalie will either catch the ball
or deflect it. If ball is caught, goalie will throw it back in to one of his
teammates. If ball is deflected, it can be recovered by anyone.
The higher SH stat, the longer shots you may attempt.

One last note for this section. As you saw, Raudy's CA was 8. CA value is
subtracted from whatever SH incoming ball has left when it reaches the goal.
However, there's also a random factor to be considered. I'll explain it in the
examples below...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
RANDOM FACTOR EFFECT
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I hated these things in FFIX, where the card game was set up so bad cos of
random numbers, which were used each time two cards battled. And random effect
is here to annoy you yet again. I'll list three examples representing how
exactly does the random effect work.
Note: All shots are made from as close to opposing goal as possible.

--> Example 1: No random effect

For starters let's assume that the game will not use any random effect when
Tidus attempts to score using Shoot command.

Tidus 100HP 9EN 10SH
Raudy 80HP       8CA

In upper stat bars you see that Tidus' SH is superior to Raudy's CA. Since no
random effect is involved, this means shot will go in and score a goal.

Tidus 100HP 9EN 10SH
Raudy 80HP      15CA

In upper stat bars you see that Tidus' SH is inferior to Raudy's CA. Since no
random effect is involved, this means shot will NOT go in, but be caught or
deflected.

--> Example 2: Positive and negative random effect

Now the game decides to play nasty with you. As Tidus attempts to shoot, a
random number is added to goalie's CA, which can range from as low as 50% of
goalie's current CA (negative random effect) and 150% of goalie's current CA
(positive random effect).
Which one will the game use? It cannot be predicted, therefore you'll need to
rely on your luck.

Tidus 100HP 9EN 10SH
Raudy 80HP       8CA

Let's say that when shot is attempted with these stats, positive random effect
is used to full extent possible, meaning Raudy's CA gets 50% boost. Thus Tidus
shoots a ball with 10 SH versus Raudy's 12 CA. The ball will not go in, since
Raudy's CA is superior to Tidus' SH.

Tidus 100HP 9EN  8SH
Raudy 80HP      12CA

Let's say that when shot is attempted with these stats, negative random effect
is used to full extent possible, meaning Raudy's CA gets 50% cut. Thus Tidus
shoots a ball with 8 SH versus Raudy's 6 CA. The ball will go in, since Raudy's
CA is inferior to Tidus' SH.

*****************************************************************************
7) USING HP
*****************************************************************************

Every action blitz players make expends HP. Whoever has the ball will steadily
lose HP as he/she swims thru the pool. As you saw in parts IV and V of
blitzball informator, passes and shots also expend HP. And so do tackles,
evasiev maneuvers and more... but this types of actions are explained in later
parts.
If by any chance player's HP becomes too low or zero, that player isn't KO-ed
or anything, he or she remains conscious. However, passes and shots become 50%
less efective, meaning respective stats are halved. Whenever HP is too low, the
commands are highlighted blue. Players with insufficient HP also can't perform
any techs.
Once a player is rid of ball, he or she will slowly regain HP (unless
poisoned).

*****************************************************************************
8) ENCOUNTERS
*****************************************************************************

Encounter happens when ball carrier come into contact with one or more (up to
five) enemy players. Tidus will again serve for example. If he's ball carrier,
action menu will open, but it will have different choices...
Let's say Tidus has been intercepted by Bickson. When action menu opens (it
does so automatically)...

Breakthrough
No Break
Break to Bickson

For now select 'No Break', as I will explain Breakthrough later. You also see
Bickson's stat bar in upper right beneath Tidus'. Now your old friend appears,
action command menu...

Action Commands
Pass 10 HP
Shoot 10 HP
Dribble

Select 'Pass', and then choose who will receive the ball. Remember before when
you made a pass, the ball was passed to target teammate. However, Bickson is in
your way now...

Tidus   80HP 9EN 10PA
Bickson 72HP 1AT  2BL

and will attempt to block Tidus' passes and shots. Bickson's BL will be
compared to Tidus' PA. Once Tidus throws a pass, amount equal to Bickson's BL
is deducted from ball's PA (exceptions are possible). If ball's PA becomes zero
or less as Bickson tries to block the ball, ball is intercepted. If ball's PA
remains at 1 or higher as Bickson tries to block, his block failed and the ball
will continue its path toward ball receiver (note that is still applies that
ball loses PA as it travels thru water).
In the example above, ball's PA would remain at 8, thus Bickson would surely
fail at an attempt to block the pass.

--> If Bickson's stats were like this...

Tidus   80HP 9EN 10PA
Bickson 72HP 1AT 18BL

Bickson would surely catch the ball (even with random factor in effect) if
Tidus tried to make a pass to another teammate.

--> How about encountering two guys at once?

Tidus   80HP 9EN 10PA
Bickson 72HP 3AT  4BL
Abus    80HP 2AT  2BL

This time BL values are added, making final result 6. But with random factor in
effect, it may not always equal 6. It could be as high as 9 and as low as 3.
Knowing that in mind, pass will go through regardless.

--> Trying to score a goal

When in enc., select 'No Break', then Shoot.

Tidus   80HP 9EN 10SH
Bickson 72HP 3AT  4BL
Abus    80HP 2AT  2BL
Raudy   80HP      8CA

When attempting to shoot, goalie's stats also come into picture, resulting in
one more opponent trying to block your shot. By subtracting both BL and CA
values you see that your shot has almost no chances to score. If you take into
account random factor, amount subtracted from SH could be as low as 7 and as
high as 21.

*****************************************************************************
9) BREAKTHROUGHS
*****************************************************************************

For this part we'll discuss Breakthroughs. For example we'll assume Tidus has
encountered three enemy players.

Tidus   80HP 11EN 11PA
Bickson 72HP  6AT 12BL
Abus    80HP  4AT  2BL
Graav   80HP  2AT  3BL

Note: Enemy player with highest AT will always be listed first below your
player's stat bar, then the next highest AT etc.
You may want to pass the ball, but Bickson has very high BL. Adding in BL of
other two members assures almost no chance for pass to succeed. Thus you decide
to break past few enemy players and reduce the amount of defenders blocking
your passes/shots.

Breakthrough
No Break
Break to Bickson
Break to Abus
Break to Graav

In this example it's very good if we get rid or Bickson, so select 'Break to
Bickson'. Bickson's AT is compared to Tidus' EN. After you chose breaking thru
Bickson, you have to decide whether you'll want to pass the ball or shoot it.
Dribble option WILL NOT be available (it is available only if you decide to
break thru ALL enemy players you encountered). After you decide on pass or
shot, HP costs are payed and Bickson tackles Tidus. As Bickson't AT even with
random effect is not enough to reduce Tidus' EN to 0 (were that to happen,
Tidus loses the ball and turnover occurs), Tidus remains in possession of the
ball.
He will now attempt to pass or shoot the ball, depending on what you chose
earlier. PA stat is compared to remaining defenders' BL, in this case Abus and
Graav. Bickson CAN'T block passes/shots anymore, since he already made a move -
you chose to break thru him. SH stat is compared to remaining defenders' BL and
goalie's CA.

*****************************************************************************
10) TECHCOPY
*****************************************************************************

Techcopy occurs when a player attempts to learn a tech from enemy players.
Let's use Tidus for example. You will need to have him *mark* (how to mark is
explained later) an enemy player who knows a desirable tech, let's say Venom
Shot from Bickson. Once Bickson is marked, you're set.
Any time during the game Bickson attempts Venom Shot, word Techcopy! will
appear in upper left. Word will flash white and blue. Press X button when the
word is flashing WHITE to learn the tech. You may fail in following cases:
- Tidus' level is too low... so you'll either need to raise Tidus' level or try
to techcopy from someone else; in short, Tidus' level should be equal or
greater from Bickson's for a successful techcopy
- some techs can only be learned at specific moment, for example Sphere Shot,
which can only be successfully techcopied right before ball is shot
- you will fail to techcopy if you press X while the word is flashing blue

Successful techcopy will be listed in lower left of the screen, where you read
game's commentary otherwise. It will say who learned a tech. Game will also let
you know again who learned what tech at halftimes or the end of game. Captured
techs can be equipped at halftime or after the match.

The chances of success depend on participant's level:
- if your opponent's level is higher than your player's: 20%
- your opponent's level is the same: 50%
- your opponent's level is lower: 100%

*****************************************************************************
12) STATUSES DURING BLITZBALL GAME
*****************************************************************************

There are three statuses you can toy around with during a game of Blitz. Or
opposing team will toy around with you...

a) Poison
Affected player's HP drop fast when in possession of the ball, and doesn't rise
at all when not in possession of the ball. Poison wears off after halftime or
after certain amount of time (around 33 seconds).
Beware, poisoned players also 'lose' their abilities temporarily. First their
shooting techs are disabled. This is followed by tackling techs (second time)
and passing techs (third time) if poison effects are stacked with ability
called Pile Venom.
HP loss due to Pile Venom effect:
1x poison - 4 HP every 0,6 seconds
2x poison - 16 HP every 0,6 seconds
3x poison - 64 HP every 0,6 seconds
4x poison - 256 HP every 0,6 seconds
5x poison - 1024 HP every 0,6 seconds

b) Nap
Otherwise known as sleep. Affected player can't do anything at all. If your
goalie is put to sleep, well, you're quite screwed. Nap wears off if sleeping
player is hit with a ball, goal is scored, after halftime or after certain
amount of time (around 53 seconds).

c) Wither
Break status? Almost. Affected player's stats (one or more) is/are halved, thus
making them less effective (halved stat is shown in blue). Wither wears off
after halftime or after certain amount of time (around 33 seconds).
Wither Shot reduces BL or CA, Wither Pass reduces PA, AT or BL, and Wither
Tackle reduces EN, PA or SH. HP stat cannot be affected!

*****************************************************************************
13) SCOUT LEVEL
*****************************************************************************

By talking to people all over Spira by pressing Square button in front of them
you can view their Blitz stats. You may not know off the bat, but there are
Scout levels, which can increase, thus allowing you to see more info. I'll
reveal how you can accomplish that.

A - Scout level 1
- Available from start of game
- Allows you to see player's name, level, for which team he/she plays (if any),
and gil fee per match

B - Scout level 2
- Available once you accumulate 10 wins with Besaid Aurochs team
- In addition to previous info you can now see player's stats as well

C - Scout level 3
- Available once you accumulate 20 wins with Besaid Aurochs team
- In addition to previous info you can now see techs player is currently
equipped with and how many tech slots he/she has unlocked so far

D - Scout level 4 (also the maximum scout level you can reach)
- Available once you accumulate 30 wins with Besaid Aurochs team
- In addition to previous info you can now see player's key techs and *all*
techs player has learned so far

*****************************************************************************
14) TEAM LEVEL
*****************************************************************************

By winning blitz games your team's level increases with every 5 wins. Besides
bragging rights winning also allows your team to learn new formations. Here are
the ones I obtained so far...

A - Centre Attack
- Players remain predominantly in field's centre
- Available once you accumulate 5 wins with Besaid Aurochs team

B - All-Out Defence
- All players enter defence mode
- Available once you accumulate 15 wins with Besaid Aurochs team

C - Flat Line
- Players form a straight line over the field
- Available once you accumulate 25 wins with Besaid Aurochs team

D - Counter
- LF and MF move towards opposing goal
- Available once you accumulate 35 wins with Besaid Aurochs team

E - Double Sides
- All members sans MF swim along the outer sides towards opposing goal
- Available once you accumulate 45 wins with Besaid Aurochs team

I've already accumulated over 100 victories with Besaid Aurochs, and no new
formations have been learned, nor have I discovered anything else that might be
of interest to me.

*****************************************************************************
15) PLAYER'S TECH SLOTS
*****************************************************************************

Level 1 and 2 players are unable to use any techs, at least not until they
reach level 3, at which point they may start equipping techs they've learned so
far. As their level increases, so does the amount of tech slots.

A - One slot    - Available once player reaches level 3.
B - Two slots   - Available once player reaches level 7.
C - Three slots - Available once player reaches level 12.
D - Four slots  - Available once player reaches level 20.
E - Five slots  - Available once player reaches level 30.

*****************************************************************************
16) PREPARATIONS FOR A GAME
*****************************************************************************

Once you select your desired mode of play (league, tournament ot exhibition),
you will be take to three pre-game setup screens, where you decide on three
things.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ASSIGN POSITIONS
Among the eight players (max number of players you can sign for Besaid Aurochs
team) choose six of them who will play one game's halftime. Note that you don't
have to select same players for same positions at start of another halftime.
You need to select LF, RF, MF, LD, RD and GL. As you move the pointer over
players' names, their stats are shown in the middle of the screen. Once every
position is filled, you'll be asked to confirm. Select Yes to proceed to next
screen.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ASSIGN TECHS
Once a player is level 3 or higher, that player can set techs to be used in a
game. On level 3 player can set one tech, as player has only one slot
available. Slots multiply as player's level goes up, up to a maximum of five
slots. I have a nasty trick for you.;)
Select any of your players. List of available tech slots and any abilities
equipped so far will appear in lower left corner. Press X by player's name and
marker will move to equipped tech list in lower left. Press X at an equipped
tech or empty tech slot to have another list pop up. This shows all techs
player has learned so far.
At the bottom of this list this player's key abilities are shown. If player
doesn't have any key abilities learned, he or she can't learn many techs. But
as player learns key techs, he or she gains access to wider range of techs that
are available for learning. Once a player has learned all three key techs, that
player can learn almost any tech.
Tidus can only learn Jecht Shot 2 tech if he knows his three key techs. Similar
applies for Wakka's Aurochs Spirit tech.
Before you set any techs tho', select Done to be taken...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ASSIGN MARKS
Your players are on left, enemy players on the right. Select one of your
players (say Tidus), and press X. Marker will now move to enemy players' list,
allowing you to choose an opponent you want to mark, ie learn techs from
him/her (if any). Enemy player's stats are displayed in middle of the screen.
Techs enemy player is currently equipped with are displayed in lower left -
those that Tidus can learn are displayed in blue.
You can mark any enemy player, but aim for those that have techs in blue
displayed among equipped tech list, as blue techs are techs that you can
attempt to techcopy during the game.
Once you've decided on marks, select Done. You will asked for confirmation
before proceeding to the actual match. Select Yes and game will begin for real.
If you select No at this point, you'll be taken to first pre-match setup
screen.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And now for the nasty trick! As Tidus is a forward, he needs shot techs and
anti-techs. Forward's enemies are defenders, who are usually equipped with Nap,
Wither, Venom or Drain Tackles. So, check out enemy players (let's say Balgerda
and Kulukan) listed fourth and fifth in the enemy player list, as these two are
defenders of the opposing team. Balgerda is equipped with Nap Pass 2, Nap
Tackle, Wither Tackle and Volley Shot. Kulukan is equipped with Nap Tackle 2
and Wither Tackle 3.
What does this tell you? As Tidus will most certainly be blocked by Balgerda
and Kulukan as he attempts to make a shot, you know now what abilities those
two will have equipped and can equip Tidus accordingly. So he'll need Anti-Nap
and Anti-Wither techs. Repeat as needed for your other players to make a killer
team, equipped with just the right techs for current game.
Now select Done, but make sure you select No, when you're asked to proceed with
the game. You will be returned to first pre-match setup screen. Reapply
positions, and at Assign techs screen equip proper techs or anti-techs, which
will help you win the game, for you know, what will the enemy use against you.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another nasty trick! Select exhibition game. For your opponents choose a team
you can easily and quickly score against. If you have Jecht Shot or Jecht Shot
2, this ain't a problem. Score ASAP. After second Blitzoff wrestle the ball
from opposing players, then press Triangle to forfeit the game. You just got an
easy victory.:) With this you can quickly and easily level up your team and
scout levels.

*****************************************************************************
17) SEASON TYPES
*****************************************************************************

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
League
10 games are played. One team plays other five teams two times during whole
season. Points are awarded based on outcome of games. If game ends in a tie,
each team that participated gets 1 point. Otherwise winner gets 3 points and
loser none. You can forfeit league games, but only when you're losing and in
possession of the ball.
After 10 league games are played, 1st, 2nd and 3rd teams are awarded prizes.
Top scorer also gets a prize. If two or more people finish as top scorers, all
of them get the prize.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tournament
Two teams are randomly seeded. Seeded teams need to play only two games.
Remaining four are randomly paired up and play match 1. Two losers of match 1
are out. Winners or match 1 are paired up with seeded teams for match 2.
Winners of match 2 square off against each other in championship match, whilst
losers of match 2 are measured in consolation match.
Winner and loser of championship match, along with winner of consolation match
are awarded prizes at end of tournament. Top scorer(s) get(s) a prize as well.
You can forfeit tournament games, but only when you're losing and in possession
of the ball.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exhibition
If you select that, you're then prompted to select a team you'd like to play
against. You can forfeit exhibition games, but only when you're in possession
of the ball. No EXP are awarded at end of halftimes.
Winner gets a small prize such as Potion, Hi-Potion, 2x Hi-Potion or Phoenix
Down (these are all the prizes I personally received so far).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

*****************************************************************************
18) EXPERIENCE POINTS
*****************************************************************************

Instead of gaining EXP in RPG itself, you deal with EXP in blitzball. EXP are
awarded for pass techs, tackle techs etc. EXP are awarded after each league or
tournament blitz halftime (no EXP are awarded after exhibition halftimes).

19) TECH CATEGORIES
*****************************************************************************

Cat. 1: Manual techs
Manual techs are techs for which you decide whether or not to use them when
given a choice. Most appropriate example would be:
Tidus is equipped with Jecht Shot. He is attempting a shot. One of the screens
that'll pop up will ask you if you want to use Normal shot, or Jecht Shot. At
this point you decided whether or not you will use Jecht Shot.
Manual techs expend player's HP during the match each time they're used.

Cat. 2: Trigger techs
Trigger techs are techs which activate with a given % by themselves under right
circumstances. Most appropriate example would be:
Tidus is equipped with Tackle Slip. Bickson is equipped with Nap Tackle. Tidus
is in encounter with Bickson and decides to Break to Bickson. As Bickson tries
to tackle Tidus, Bickson misses cos of Tackle Slip kicking in.
Trigger techs expend player's HP during the match each time they're used - as
mentioned, you cannot actively select to use them.

Cat. 3: Continuous techs
Continuous techs are techs that are active during the whole match. You cannot
actively select to use them, nor are they automaticaly activated. An example of
cont. tech is Golden Arm or Brawler.
Cont. techs do not expend player's HP. Instead they have HP equip cost: this
means, that if you equip Golden Arm (equip cost 30 HP) on Tidus prior to the
match, his HP will be reduced by 30 in exchange for Golden Arm effect to be
active during whole match.

*****************************************************************************
20) TIPS FOR SUCCESSFUL BLITZ TEAM
*****************************************************************************

TIP 1: WHEN TO START?
I started playing actively after I got the airship permanently. I recommend
that you wait until then also. One of the main reasons to wait that late in the
game is: in case you win lot of early games, other teams will recruit players
which may otherwise be unattainable to you in early parts of the game (Linna,
Brother, and so on). But if you wait until you get the airship, you can recruit
those players for yourself without other teams interfering.

TIP 2: ASSIGNING
To start a successful blitz team, you need to assign good players. You can
assign new players by walking up to a blitz player and pressing square.
Depending on scout level you will see info about that player. Once you cycle
thru it, you'll be asked if you want to 'Sign player?', but only if the player
you're examining is free agent. Select yes to be prompted for how many games.
After that salary will be displayed and final confirmation will be displayed
before signing a contract.
If your team already consists of 8 players, you'll need to release someone
before new player is accepted. Note that you never release Tidus.

TIP 3: LEFT AND RIGHT FORWARD
Forwards are team members that will attempt to score goals. Ideal LV30 forward
should IMO have following stats and techs:
- high HP for shot techs he/she will be using
- high EN for attempting to break thru defenders
- high SH for attempts to make shots past defenders and goalie (suitable for
cases where you don't like breaking thru defenders)
- Anti-Venom 2, Anti-Wither 2, Anti-Nap 2, Tackle Slip 2, Invisible Shot

You can consider these augmentations:
- Tidus doesn't need high EN, as his Jecht Shot techs remove two to three
defenders... and you can't dismiss Tidus anyway, so you got yourself one
forward already
- if a player has enormous SH, you may not need EN, for you can attempt to
shoot a goal from further away, this way not being anywhere near defenders
- Sphere Shot or Nap Shot 3 are good choices for shot techs as well

Why do I recommend above abilities?
- Anti-Venom 2 is needed very much. As you know, poisoned player's shoot techs
are disabled first, and forwards do you no good if they can't use shoot techs.
- Anti-Wither 2 is recommended also as it successfully foils defenders' tries
to halve forward's stats. Were they able to do that, your forward's SH stat
could be reduced for up to 87,5%, just to name an example.
- Anti-Nap 2? Sleeping forward is not useful at all, therefore having this tech
ensures your forward will never go to sleep.
- Tackle Slip 2 assures 80% chances of your forward successfully avoiding
tackles. I say the risk is worth it in spite of chances being disoriented
after.
- Invisible Shot? Once the ball gets past all defenders, you've already won.
You can always score by aiming at the lower left corner. Even though the small
marker will point outside goal boundaries, ball will go in and score.

Other recommended forward?
- Oh, I recommend Linna so much! She starts with Nap Shot 3, Anti-Venom 2 and
Volley Shot.

TIP 4: MIDFIELDER
Midfielder is team member that will see most of the action. MF also tries to
catch the ball after blitzoff and takes care that most passes are made to your
forwards. MF is also first line of defence against enemy forwards. Ideal LV30
MF should IMO have following stats and techs:
- high AT for attempts to tackle enemy players trying to get to your side of
the pool
- high PA for making passes to your forwards
- high SP for luring enemy players after him/her, thus allowing forwards to
have less defenders to deal with
- high BL for blocking passes/shots of enemy players
- Nap Pass 3, Wither Tackle 3, Venom Tackle 3, Brawler, Golden Arm

Why do I recommend above abilities?
- Nap Pass 3 is very useful. MF with high PA and this tech could encounter all
five of enemy players and put them all to sleep with one Nap Pass 3.:)
- Wither Tackle 3 ensures that MF will halve one enemy player's stat whenever
that player is tackled. If it's forwards you're trying to tackle, I recommend
poisoning them first. Halving forward's stats may seem more efficient, but it's
dangerous as forwards can still use shoot techs, whereas poisoned forwards
can't use those.
- Venom Tackle 3 ensures that MF will poison enemy player whenever that player
is tackled and also disable that player's shoot techs. If it's forwards you're
trying to tackle, I recommend poisoning them first.
- Brawler will allow MF to get into encounters from further away.
- Golden Arm assures that ball's PA will not drop as fast as it usually does.

Recommended midfielder?
- Get Brother! His skills as MF are unmatched and to top it off, he boasts an
enormous speed stat for lure-enemy-away tactics.

TIP 5: LEFT AND RIGHT DEFENSE
LD and RD are team members, representing second defence line against incoming
enemy forwards, who make it past your MF. Ideal LV30 defenceman should IMO have
following stats and techs:
- high AT for attempting to tackle enemy player, should he/she choose to break
thru
- high BL for blocking enemy player's shots or passes, should he/she choose to
do so
- high SP for catching up with enemy player
- good PA for making successful passes to your MF once your defence wins the
ball from enemy player
- Venom Tackle 3, Wither Tackle 3, Anti-Nap 2, Golden Arm, Brawler

Why do I recommend above abilities?
- Wither Tackle 3 ensures that LD or RD will halve one enemy player's stat
whenever that player is tackled. If it's forwards you're trying to tackle, I
recommend poisoning them first. Halving forward's stats may seem more
efficient, but it's dangerous as forwards can still use shoot techs, whereas
poisoned forwards can't use those.
- Venom Tackle 3 ensures that LD or RD will poison enemy player whenever that
player is tackled and also disable that player's shoot techs. If it's forwards
you're trying to tackle, I recommend poisoning them first.
- Anti-Nap 2 assures that your defence will never fall asleep. Poisoned or
withered defenceman is not half as bad as sleeping one.
- Brawler will allow your defencemen to get into encounters from further away.
- Golden Arm assures that ball's PA will not drop as fast as it usually does.

Recommended LD and RD?
- For one defence position I recommend Ropp.
- For other Balgerda, but you'll need to wait for her contract with Luca Goers
to run out. Until then Kyou will make a good replacement.

TIP 6: GOALKEEPER
Goalie is your final line of defence against incoming forwards. They try to
catch or at least deflect shots enemy forwards make toward your goal. Ideal
LV30 goalie should IMO have following stats and techs:
- high CA to intercept incoming shots with ease
- good amount of HP for techs we will equip on a goalie
- Grip Gloves, Super Goalie, Anti-Nap 2, Anti-Wither 2, Regen

Why do I recommend above abilities?
- Grip Gloves increase goalies chances of catching the ball rather than
deflecting it (in which case Volley Shot equipped enemy forwards may attempt to
score a goal).
- Super Goalie randomly activates during ball's approach to your goal and adds
random number to goalie's CA.
- Anti-Nap 2 is there to assure your goal is always defended by non-sleeping
goalie.
- Anti-Wither 2 assures your goalie's stats will never be halved, which would
otherwise make your goalie only half as useful.
- Regen will make sure that your goalie will rarely run out of HP.

Recommended goalie?
- Duren for starters. But as soon as Nimrook from Al Bhed Psyches team is free
agent, sign a contract with Nimrook!

TIP 7: WHICH SEASON TO START?
Start with a tournament to gain first few EXP you need to reach level 3, at
which point you can start equipping techs. Once you get that high, switch to
few exhibition games which you should use as the opportunity to techcopy some
techs from enemy players (esp key techs your players need to be able to copy
wider range of techs - for starters I recommend learning at least one key tech
for each of your players).
Once you feel your players are at least properly equipped, you can try
finishing a league. By the time you end it your players should be around levels
7 to 12, thus having two to three tech slots available.
Now again switch to exhibition games for a while and attempt to learn second
key tech for each of your players.
Another league season should be enough to reach level 20 for your players,
allowing fourth tech slot to open up. At this point of the game you should
already have little to no problems winning a blitz game, esp with my strat I
posted. Play whatever season you wish and experiment as you see fit.
Oh, one last note... don't forget to evenly level up all players of your team
or you will regret it later (use the free EXP trick).

21) DETAILED PLAYERS OVERVIEW
*****************************************************************************

I've taken this section out as it isn't needed. If you need info on who to
recruit, the abilities learned etc., please refer to Blitzball FAQs that are
up.

*****************************************************************************
21) ABOUT BEST TEAMS
*****************************************************************************

Following info compiled by Evil R!

Best team suggestions:

I'll divide the BB game into 4 parts since most people won't play BB until
level 99. I suggest that you should start Blitz Ball after Djose Temple since
that is when the ferry will become available again and you can go back to
recruit some good players.

The best team early on right after Djose Temple is:

LF: Tidus
MF: Tatts/Kiyuri
RF: Vilucha
LD: Wedge
RD: Zalitz/Ropp
G: Jumal

If you don't plan to play BB early on then you can consider the following
teams.

Level 1-29

LF: Tidus/Wakka
MF: Tatts/Berrik (Al Behd Psyches)/Brother/Kiyuri/Naida/Svanda/Rin
RF: Vilucha/Shammi/Mep/Linna
LD: Zalitz/Judda (Al Bhed Psyches)/Kyou/Ropp
RD: Wedge
G: Nimrook/Miyu/Jumal/Kyou/Yuma Guado

Level 30-59

LF: Tidus/Wakka
MF: Brother/Berrik/Tatts/Kiyuri/Vuroja (Kilika Beasts)/Svanda
RF: Basik, Argai Ronso (Ronso Fangs)/Vilucha/Linna/Shammi/Larbeight (Kilika
Beasts)
LD: Judda/Ropp/Irga/Kulukan
RD: Wedge
G: Nimrook/Miyu/Kyou/Jumal/Keppa/Yuma Guado

Level 60-90

LF: Tidus/Nedus/Wakka
MF: Kiyuri/Vuroja/Svanda/Naida/Mifurey/Brother/Nav Guado
RF: Vilucha/Larbeight/Linna/Shammi/Besik, Argai Ronso
LD: Ropp
RD: Kulukan/Irga/Zev Ronso
G: Nimrook

Level 99

LF: Larbeight/Tidus/Wakka/Nedus
MF: Vuroja/Kiyuri/Mifurey/Linna/Svanda/Ropp
RF: Vilucha/Linna/Shammi/Isken
LD: Ropp/Kiyuri
RD: Kulukan/Irga/Zev Ronso
G: Nimrook/Wedge

*****************************************************************************
22) FINAL WORDS
*****************************************************************************

Personally I think that blitzball is extremely boring. Although I'm sure Square
meant well and all when they were making it, it could be done better. I mean,
just look at one blitz game... half the time you spend looking at your or enemy
players swimming around, making passes or shots and so on, and the other half
you spend pondering whether or not your shot will go thru.
It also takes a very long time to build a good team. And awards you're
receiving are most often pathetic... Hi-Potion for finishing first in league
season? I'd rather go Overkill Nemesis 10 times instead.
The only reason to even remotely bother with blitzball is to gain overdrives
for Wakka and Jupiter Sigil for his World Champion. After you have all of these
items, get the hell out of blitz world.

XXXIII) FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS - FAQ ---> A842
=============================================================================
=============================================================================

Greetings! In this section most commonly asked questions will be answered.

Q1 - I missed Destruction Sphere at Bevelle, but now I can't enter it again.
What can I do?
A1 - There is no way you can miss Destruction Sphere at Bevelle. You need to
pick it up and use it in order to be able to leave the temple when you first
visit it. Again I stress that there is no way in purgatory you could've missed
that sphere.

Q2 - I have PAL version of FFX and have beaten the game. I have also heard of
extra ending that is on DVD, but I don't get to view it once I beat the game.
After words The End appear, that's it.
A2 - That bit of 'ending' can only be seen on Bonus DVD that came along with
Japanese INT version. The movie you'd like to see sadly hasn't been put on
bonus DVD that came along with PAL FFX.

Q3 - How do I open that darn door in Remiem Temple? I want Magus Sisters!
A3 - You need Flower Sceptre (get it by defeating Belgemine's Bahamut inside
Remiem Temple), Blossom Crown (capture at least one of each fiend from Calm
Lands and Gagazet, then arena manager hands it over). You'll also need to
obtain Anima and Yojimbo. Only then will you be able to remove the seal barring
the door and obtain final trio of aeons.

Q4 - I've entered Baaj Temple in order to get Anima. There're six statues in
there. Five of them lit up and one didn't. But I'm sure I got Destruction
Sphere from all temples I've visited so far. What gives?
A4 - You're missing Destruction Sphere from Zanarkand Temple. Return there.
Monitor shows white squares. You now need to step on all seven white squares
found in both parts of the temple. Once stepped on, pick up now revealed
Destruction Sphere. Go to the monitor in that other room. Insert it in one of
the holes. Collect Magistral Rod and sixth seal is broken. Return to Baaj
Temple and Anima is yours.

Q5 - Where is Tonberry in Cavern of S. F.? And what is the deal with Magic Urns
I so often run into?
A5 - Tonberry is one of rare fiends that's hard to encounter. As is common
belief on Gamefaqs FFX board, Tonberry can be encountered the most in far green
room. If even that doesn't work like it should, save your game and then reload.
As odd as it sounds, this seems to reset game's random encounter order and
frequency of which monsters you encounter, so this might help you find Tonberry
more often.
As for Magic Urns, no purpose has been found as of yet. Urns are only killable
with Yojimbo's Zanmato or by Dooming them (200 turns), but don't bother as you
get nothing in return. You may be interested in 'seven items' stuff you can
find in Urn's scan. That too hasn't been deciphered yet. Either you can get
seven different items from Urn or up to seven items in one battle, neither of
which I've been able to do. So for now, don't bother.

Q6 - There are some guys that won't let me enter the temples! What can I do?
A6 - Have you been to Highbridge yet? When Kimahri suggests so in one of the
scenes aboard the airship, Highbridge will become a destination on NavMap. Go
there, see the scene and you will no longer be prohibited from entering the
temples. BTW, recently I found out that you simply cannot miss talking to
Kimahri and Yuna in order for Highbridge to appear as a destination - you HAVE
to talk to both of them in order for the story to progress.

Q7 - Where the purgatory is eighth Cactuar Isrra? It's pretty obvious from the
clue he's supposed to be in the hole Sandragora was in before, but the bastard
is nowhere to be found.
A7 - You need to exit *Sanubia Desert - West* to *Sanubia Desert - Central* and
then reenter the West Desert. Recheck the sand traps and Isrra will be found in
one of them.

Q8 - Nemesis is still locked!
A8 - You need to capture 10 of every captureable fiend, you need to defeat all
Area creations, you need to defeat all Species creations, and you need to
defeat all seven Original creations (sans Nemesis, of course). Only after
you've done all that, Nemesis will be unlocked. Lastly, Nemesis is found under
Original creations, page two, which means you should press right once you enter
that submenu.

Q9 - I try to enter Besaid after I gain airship permanently, but I get my
behind handed to me by some flying bastard. What can I do? And... um, there's
an icy problem in front of Macalania temple. Tips?
A9 - You *have* to defeat this flying annoyance or 'wooohooo!'. One option is
boosting your stats a bit to stand better chances. The other is summoning
Yojimbo in battle and paying him all your gil, also hoping that random factor
is on your side and he'll do Zanmato.

Q10 - Help! I can't find Garuda, Qactuar, Simurgh etc. Oh, and I also heard
that this enemy most often pops up at this part. Can you take a pic of the
area?
A10 - I'm afraid I'll have to say no to this request. Based on my experience a
certain enemy tends to pop up just as often on one part of the background as it
does on the other. As it's often been said already, if you just can't seem to
capture certain enemy, save your game, then reset, then load lastly saved game
and try again. Monster encounter probability has changed with this, hopefully
for the better.
If I were to take a pic of the area and say: Simurgh pops up here for sure,
you'd go try it... and 10 Basilisks later you'd still be left resultless. I can
only provide you with two specific solutions:
- Qactuar can be fought in Thunder Plains, but only after you've prayed to a
Cactuar stone (you know, the ones that glow every so often) by pressing Square
button.
- Garuda can only be fought on Mushroom Rock: Precipice, and Mushroom Rock:
Valley. You will know so if you enter Triangle menu and examine lower left
corner where it says the name of the area.

Q11 - I need help with this and that boss!
A11 - Please! Use the strategies I wrote in the guide. I assure you that they
will help you win against whatever it is you're up against. Strategies I wrote
are result of lots of trial and error tests I ran when fighting those bosses.
If you still can't win, then next reason you aren't able to do so is cos you're
underpowered, in which case you should level up a bit. If you don't want to do
that, then get all of your aeons in overdrives and use them on bosses. This
alone should finally get you victory.

1. Send your comments, ideas for improvements, additional info, correction of
mistakes I may have made, and anything else via e-mail at:

lifearmor (at) gmail (dot) com

I need to put down a few guidelines.
- as a subject of e-mail please include Final Fantasy X, or FFX
- please make your e-mail be readable, ie do not send me e-mails that are
written badly or in some strange gibberish
- don't ask me to send you updated versions of my guide, because I won't
- *make sure* to check if your question is already answered within these pages;
I may reply to one of your questions, but if you'll persevere in asking more
questions which are answered in my guide, I'll simply direct you to my guide
- I accept e-mails in English, German, Croatian and Slovenian language
- I will answer the e-mails in English, Croatian or Slovenian language; I can
read and understand German well, but my writing skills of German have rusted,
therefore I will answer such e-mails in English
- when crediting contributors, I won't disclose their e-mails
- finally, treat me as you'd like me to treat you
