   Relm Arrowny - In her pictures she captures everything: forests, water,
                  light... the very essence of life...
              Special Skill: Sketch ---> Control
              Relm can draw an enemy and then have her drawings attack.
              Wearing the FakeMustache she can control enemies.

   Umaro - Admirer of bone-carvings, as strong as a gigas, a sasquatch pal
           with muscle!
              Special Skill: Storm, Rage
              Umaro does what every he wants.  But if you equip him with the
              Blizzard Orb he can cause an ice storm. If equipped with the
              Rage Ring he can pick up another character and throw them at
              the enemy for a lot of damage.

   Gogo - Shrouded in odd clothing,... is this a man...?...a woman...?...or
          should we ask...?
              Special Skill: Mimic
              The only thing Gogo can do is mimic the last person to attack.
              If they attacked, Gogo attacks.  If they cast a spell, Gogo
              casts the same spell.  If they use an item, Gogo uses that
              item too.  He'll even dance if Mog dances before him.
              Gogo can also do ANY of the other character's attacks by going
              to the status screen and filling the empty slots under "Mimic".
              (Move the pointer down to an empty slot and press A).

   in the game but aren't actually main characters.

            The two soldiers can use the armor they are wearing to send out
            powerful beams to destroy their enemies.  These beams include a
            fire beam, an ice beam, and a bolt beam.  They also have the
            ability to heal using Heal Force.

   This walkthru is exactly that, a walkthru.  It takes the player through
   every location in the game, in the best order to go through them.  The
   numbers before each location corresponds to the numbers on the maps that
   come with the game.
                          - The World of Balance -
(1) Mines of Narshe
    Party: Vicks, Wedge, ????? (Terra)
    BOSS: Whelk
        After fighting Whelk you come to the frozen Esper.  You'll go into
        a fight sequence where Vicks and Wedge get blown away leaving Terra.

(1) Arvis' House
    Items: Search the clock for an Elixir
        Terra wakes up back in Narshe where a man removes the slave crown.
        Terra can't remember anything.  The Imperial guards come and Terra
        is forced to escape thru the back door of the house and run back to
        the mines.

(1) Mines
    Party: Terra, Locke
    Chests: Fenix Down, Sleeping Bag
            (if you wait until the World of Ruin to get these, they'll
             have changed to a Pod Bracelet and an Elixir)
    BOSS: Marshal
    Additional items: You can take Mog's Mithril Shld and Mithril Pike
        After entering the mines, Terra walks a little ways and is spotted
        by the guards.  She is cornered and the floor gives out and she
        falls.  There is a flashback where Terra remembers some stuff.  The
        scene shifts back to Arvis' House where Locke is introduced.  Locke
        finds Terra and the guards find them both.  Moogles come and offer
        to help.  Three Moogles (Kupek, Kupop, Kumama) form a group with

        Locke plus there are two other groups with four Moogles each (Mog,
        Kuku, Kutan, Kupan and Kushu, Kurin, Kuru, Kamog).  You can control
        each of the groups, the object is to stop the guards from reaching
        Terra and defeating the commander.  Before defeating the commander
        switch to the party Mog is in and remove his shield and pike (Locke
        can use the shield and the pike can be used by Edgar who you'll get
        shortly), after all Mog won't be needing them for quite a while and
        by then you'll be able to equip him with other stuff.  After defeating
        the commander, Locke grabs Terra and takes off through the mines.  He
        comes to a switch and pulls it, opening a secret passage.  Remember
        where this passage is, you'll need it later.  You are now outside
        Narshe.  You can't enter the main part of town but you can enter the
        classroom.

(1) Classroom
    Party: Terra, Locke
    Points of interest: A bucket of recovery water (recovers hps and mps)
                        A save spot
    Chests: Monster-in-a-box, Sleeping Bag, Tonic
    Items: Search a pot for Tincture
        Besides getting the stuff in the chests and the pot, the classroom
        is basically there to tell you stuff about the game: how to do this
        and where to do that, most of which is in the instruction book.

(2) Figaro
    Party: Terra, Locke, Edgar
    Points of interest: Item shop, Tool Shop
    Chests: Fenix Down, Soft, Tonic, Antidote
    BOSS: M-TekArmor
        After heading south from Narshe, you come to the desert castle of
        Figaro.  Upon entering the castle go straight ahead to the throne
        room.  Here Edgar is introduced.  You are now free to explore the
        castle.  If you talk to the Matron (in the left tower) she will tell
        you about Sabin, who you'll meet later.  After talking the Matron
        return to the throne room and talk to Edgar again.  One of Edgar's
        guards comes in and informs him that Kefka is approaching the castle.
        As Edgar, talk to Kefka's guards and then Kefka himself.  After they're

        done talking walk up to where Locke is waiting.  Edgar decides to
        protect Terra.  Now, as Terra, follow Locke to 'your' room.  Kefka
        comes back and sets fire to Figaro.  Talk to the guards (Beavis and
        Butthead ?) and then talk to Kefka.  Go up and talk to the guard there.
        Your party escapes and Figaro enters submerge mode.  After fighting
        the M-TekArmor, go south to the Cave of Figaro.  If Terra uses
        magic during the fight with the M-TekArmor you'll see a little scene.

(3) Cave of Figaro
    Party: Terra, Locke, Edgar
    Points of interest: the pond with the turtle is a recovery spring
    Chests: 2 tinctures, Fenix Down (Before you get Celes)
            Thunder Rod, Tincture, X-Potion (After you get Celes)
            Hero Ring, Ether, X-Potion (In the World of Ruin)
        Wait until after you get Celes, or until the World of Ruin to get the
        treasures for different stuff.

(4) South Figaro
    Chests: 500 GP, 1000 GP, 1500 GP
    Items: search barrel to left of Chocobo stable for Tonic

           search barrel to right of rich guy's house for Fenix Down
           search barrel above and behind Chocobo stable for Warp Stone
                        (or Fenix Down if you wait until World of Ruin)
           search box in lower left section of town for Eyedrop
                        (or Elixir if you wait until World of Ruin)

                        (or Tent if you wait until World of Ruin)
           search box in lower left section of town for Soft
                        (or Remedy if you wait until World of Ruin)
           search barrel between Armor & Weapon shops for Tonic
                        (or X-Potion if you wait until World of Ruin)
        At the Cafe, Shadow is introduced, you'll be seeing him later.  At
        the Relic Shop, buy a pair of Sprint Shoes (unless you like going
        slow), one pair is enough for the entire party.  At the house north
        of the Inn check behind the bookcase in the room with a draft to find
        a secret passage.  Nothing but money down there right now but later
        you'll need to know about it.  After getting equipped go to the
        Chocobo Stables and pay the 80 GP (unless you want to fight to your
        next location).  It's not very far but riding the Chocobo is fun :)

(5) Sabin's Cabin
    Items: search the bucket next to the stove for a Tonic
    Points of interest: you can catch some Z's in any of the beds

(6) Mt. Kolts
    Chests: Guardian,Atlas Armlet,2 Tents
    BOSS: Vargas
        The path is straight forward.  At the end you reach Vargas.  After
        a bit of fighting with Vargas, Sabin will come.  Vargas will blow the
        others away and Sabin will have to fight alone.  Sabin joins you after
        Vargas is finished.

(7) Returner's Hideout
    Party: Terra, Locke, Edgar, Sabin
    Chests: Fenix Down (x2), Air Lancet, True Knight, Potion, White Cape
    Items: search a bucket for Antidote
           search a pot for Tincture
           search a pot for Green Cherry
           search the top of the table for a piece of paper (purpose ?)
    Additional items: You can either get a Genji Glove or a Gauntlet
        After entering, follow the guard to Banon's room.  After talking to
        Banon talk to everyone and get everything (including the White Cape
        that is in a secret passage on the right side of the 'storage room'),
        then go out of the hideout where Banon will be waiting. First, tell him

        "no" then go back inside and the man in the 'storage room' will give
        you a Genji Glove.  If you say "no" to Banon 3 times and you'll skip
        the part where everyone's at the table and one of the guards will give
        you a Genji Glove (if you didn't already get the one from the guy
        in the store room).  If you go to Banon and tell him you will become
        there last ray of hope he will give you Gauntlet (if you haven't alread
y
        gotten the Genji Glove from the guy in the store room). Locke will spli
t
        to scope out South Figaro after the Empire invades.  Banon joins you
        and you head for the raft on the Lete River.

    Lete River
    BOSS: Ultros
        If Banon dies the game is over, so protect him.  There are several
        save spots along the way, these spots are also the only places you
        can access the subscreen.  Do whatever you need to before jumping
        back on the raft.  Toward the end of the raft ride you reach Ultros
        the octopus.  After the fight, Sabin jumps in after Ultros and is
        swept down river.

    The game now gives you a choice of three scenarios.  One with Terra, Edgar
    and Banon, one with Locke, and the last one with Sabin.  You can do these
    in any order you want, it doesn't matter what order you pick.  However,
    if you do Terra, Edgar, and Banon's before Sabin's then Shadow will stay
    longer.
                        --TERRA, EDGAR, and BANON scenario--
    Lete River continued
    Party: Terra, Edgar, Banon
        The trio continue the raft ride on the Lete River.  Again, make sure
        Banon doesn't kick the bucket or your game is over. At the end of the
        ride you find yourself a little east of Narshe, which is where you
        want to go.

(1) Narshe/Mines
    Chest: Rune Edge [in mines] (if you don't get this chest until the World
                        of Ruin it'll become a Ribbon)
        The guards won't let you in thru the main entrance so you'll have to
        find another way in.  Remember the secret entrance Locke showed you?
        That's the way in.  You're now in the mines.  Go a little ways and
        you come to a follow-the-light-maze.  If you make a mistake all you
        need to do is press the A button when the yellow light is in front
        of you.  If you miss it you'll have to fight some enemies and
        then you'll have to start at the beginning of the maze again.
        The correct way thru is:
                               E---|                  * = rocks
                               *   |   *              S = Start
                             |---| |------|           E = Exit
                           * | * |     *  |       | & - = Correct path
                         |---|   |        |
                         | *   * |     *  |
                         |-----S |--------|
        Once you get past this maze you can reach a cave of Moogles (and a
        chest containing a Rune Edge or Ribbon if you wait) by going slightly
        out of your way. Remember where this cave is because later in the game
        Mog will join you here).  Once you get out of the mines you will be bac
k
        in Arvis' House where you started.  You will talk a bit with
        Arvis and then the scenario will end.
                        --LOCKE's scenario--
(4) South Figaro
    Party: Locke
    Chest: Hyperwrist, RunningShoes
    Items: Check the clock you see when you first come out of the secret
                        passage for an Elixir
           Check a pail in the old man-who-wants-cider's house for Tonic
    Additional items: Cider is located here (Rare item)
                      Old Clock-Key is located here (Rare item)
        First of all, DO NOT talk the guards in MagiTek armor (unless of
        course you have a death wish :)  Oh, and don't forget to equip your
        stuff.  Go to the Item shop and talk to the merchant next to the clock.
        This will start a fight.  Use Locke's Steal command and you'll steal
        the clothes right off him.  Dressed as a merchant, enter the house
        to the south of the Item Shop and go down stairs.  The kid will only
        allow you to pass if your dresses as a merchant.  Now go up onto the
        perimeter wall and talk to the green suited guard.  Steal his clothes.
        Go towards the center of town where you'll find three guards (one
        guarding the door to the rich guy's house, one in MagiTek armor, and
        one guarding the path to the rest of the town).  Talk to the bottom
        guards.  Enter the Cafe and go downstairs.  Steal the merchant's
        clothes. You'll also get Cider.  Go back to the house with the kid
        and go upstairs.  Talk to the old man at the desk.  Go back down
        stairs and give the password ("Courage") to the kid.  He'll open up
        a secret passage for you.  Go to the upstairs of the house and into
        the first room.  Walk behind the bookcase to find a stairway.  Go all
        the way down and follow the hall.  After you are asked about changing
        clothes (doesn't matter if you do), go straight down into the
        wall (there is a stairway there):
                ----------------|                    | & - = wall
                --------------| |                        / = door
                |-------------| |--/--/--/-|             ^ = walk into the
                |                          |                 wall here to
                |--------------------------|                 find a room
                               ^                             with a Hyper-
                                                             wrist and Running
                                                             Shoes
        If you are wearing the merchant's clothes or your normal clothes you'll
        hide in the rafters.  If you're wearing the soldier's uniform you
        stand next to the door and salute, and then when you rescue Celes she
        says something close to what Princess Liea said in Star Wars when
        Luke rescued her on the Death Star (replace soldier with Stormtrooper).
        After dropping from the rafters, enter the open door.  Remove Celes'
        chains.  Talk to the sleeping guard and take the clock key.  The
        second door is a save spot and the third is where you want to go.
        Go to the clock in the far back and check it.  Wind the clock to
        open a secret passage.

(4) Secret Passage
    Party: Locke, Celes
    Chests: Iron Armor, Heavy Shld, RegalCutlass, X-Potion, Ribbon,
                Ether, Earrings
    BOSS: TunnlArmr
        In the secret passage there is a spot that you can push on the left
        wall to reach a stairway leading down to a X-Potion, a Ribbon, and
        and Ether.  Once you make it out of the secret passage you'll be in a
        spot where all you need to do is leave the town.  Go west to the Cave
        of Figaro.  You've been here before, just go back out the way you came
        in.  Don't forget the pond with the turtle is a recovery spring.  As
        you are about to exit the cave, TunnelArmr attacks.Defeating TunnelArmr
        will end this scenario.

                        --SABIN's scenario--
    Hut (Gau's father's house)
    Party: Sabin, Shadow
        Enter the hut just east of where you start.  Quickly talk to the guy
        on the Chocobo.  He sells lots of stuff.  Next talk to Shadow and
        he'll join you.  Go east a bit then south until you come to a bridge.
        This is the Imperial camp.

(9) Imperial Camp
    Party: Sabin, Shadow
        Your group hides and overhears the plans to storm Doma Castle.

(10)Doma Castle
    Party: Cyan
    BOSS: Leader
        You can kill the soldiers on either side of the leader pretty easily
        but just kill the leader and get it over with.

(9) Imperial Camp
    Party: Sabin, Shadow
    Chest: Star Pendant, Monster-in-a-box(Telstar), MithrilGlove,BarrierRing
        In the left tent there is a chest.  Kicking it brings the dogs, which
        you have to fight, and hitting it brings a sentry which you fool by
        meowing.  Inside is a Star Pendant.  There's a little bit of story
        about Kefka poisoning Doma and you decide to try and stop him.  After
        the first time you chase him, instead of talking to him, explore the
        camp for more treasures.  You fight and chase him around for a bit but
        are stopped by some soldiers.  While fighting them, Kefka poisons Doma.
        After showing a bunch of soldiers die of poison in Doma Castle you
        control Cyan.  Go to the throne room.  After the King dies go to the
        room east of the throne room.  Cyan's family dies.  Scene cuts back to
        the Imperial Camp where Cyan joins Sabin and Shadow.  Escape the camp.
        After leaving the camp go south to the forest.

(11) Phantom Forest
     Party: Sabin, Shadow, Cyan
     Points of interest: after the first stretch of forest you go up, the pond
                                right in front of you is a recovery spring.
        At the end of the forest you'll come to the Phantom Train.  If you
        haven't done Terra, Edgar, and Banon's scenerio yet, then Shadow
        will leave you somewhere in the Forest.

(11) Phantom Train
     Chests: Earrings, Monster-in-a-box(Specter), 2 Fenix Downs, Sniper Sight
     BOSS: Ghost Train
        Caboose: Upon enter the train go right to find the caboose.  Talk to
                 the ghost and you can have him join you (if you use its
                 POSSESS command, and it works, you'll lose it).  Also in the
                 caboose is a guy who'll tell you about the train, and a save
                 spot.
        Car 1 & 2: In the first two cars there are a bunch of ghosts. These
                   ghosts will either try to join you, attack you, or sell
                   you stuff (Item Shop).  The rest of the ghosts in the
                   train will do the same things.
        Car 3: Upon entering a ghost comes and blocks the door behind you.
               You have to kill the ghost to leave.  Once back out, climb
               to the top of the car and you'll jump across to the next car
               and then again to car 5.
        Car 5: Enter the car and pull the switch to detach the rear cars.
               Pull it again to open the wall up so you can continue.
        Car 6: Sit at the center table and the ghost will serve you (this
               replenishes your stats).  After sitting down the first time
               sit down again with different members at the head of your
               party to see different sequences (For instance, Shadow will
               get up and feed Interceptor).
        Car 7: 1st room: Siegfried attacks as you approach the chest.  After
                         defeating him, he grabs the contents of the chest
                         and runs.
        Car 8: 2nd room: four chests.
        After car 8 your ghost companion leaves.
        Car 9: save spot
        Engine: Pull the 1st and 3rd switches on the inside then go out and
                pull the switch on the smoke stack.  The Ghost Train now
                attacks.  After showing the people of Doma enter the train
                you are on the other side of the Phantom Forest.  Go to the
                mountain pass to the east.

(12)Barren Falls
        Here Shadow leaves the party (if he hasn't already).  Jump off the
        edge of the cliff.  You have to fight Piranha and a Rizopas as you
        fall.

(13)The Veldt
    Party: Sabin, Cyan
        After landing you awake to find Gau standing next to you. He runs when
        you speak to him.  Until you have Dried Meat just attack Gau if you
        meet him.  Go east to the town of Mobliz.

(14)Mobliz
    Items: search the clock in the messenger's house for Elixir
    Additional items: You can get a Tintinabar here
        Buy at least one Dried Meat at the item shop.  Talk to the injured
        lad from Maranda.  After talking to him you can send a message to his
        girlfriend at the messenger's house.  It costs 500 GP.  You can sleep
        in the bed at the back of the Relic Shop so no need to spend money
        at the Inn.  After talking to the Relic Shop keeper go back to the
        injured lad, another letter has arrived.  For another 500 GP you can
        send a record for the injured lad.  Talk to the Relic Shop keeper
        again, return to the lad for another letter, send a Tonic for another
        500 GP, talk to the Relic Shop keeper, etc.  Keep doing this and
        eventually the injured lad will reward you with a Tintinabar for all
        your help.  Now leave town and go find Gau.

(13)The Veldt
        When you see Gau use Dried Meat on him and he'll join you.  Once you
        have Gau and have advance his Rage skills as much as you want, go to
        the cave in Crescent Mountain.

(15)Crescent Mountain
    Party: Sabin, Cyan, Gau
    Additional items: Exploring the cave Gau will find a Tonic for you
        By taking Gau around inside the cave he'll find stuff.  On the little
        platform to the left of the entrance he'll find Tonic.  On the
        platform at the top left part of the cave Gau will pretend to have
        found something. Sabin will walk over and Gau will scare him, causing
        him to lose his pouch with 500 GP in it.  Finally at the end of the
        cave he'll find his treasure, a diving suit helmet.  After you jump
        in you'll be in the "Serpent's Trench."

    Serpent's Trench
    Chests: X-Potion, Green Beret
        There are spots in the trench where you can pick a direction.  The
        following table shows what directions do what:
                           START
                        /          \
                LEFT                   RIGHT
               /    \                    |
            LEFT   RIGHT               CAVE 1
             |       |                /      \
            OUT    CAVE 2          LEFT     RIGHT
                     |              |         |
                    OUT            OUT      CAVE 2
                                              |
                                             OUT
        As you can see taking two lefts is the fastest way out but taking two
        rights will get you all the treasure.  Anyway you go you come out
        of the trench at Nikeah.

(16)Nikeah
    Items: check the clock in the Inn for Elixir
        Besides the Elixir in the Inn, there really isn't much here.  Go back
        to the guy on the boat and hop aboard.  End of Scenerio.

(1) Hills of Narshe
    Party: Terra, Locke, Edgar, Sabin, Gau, Celes, Cyan
    BOSS: Kefka
        You'll fight in 3 groups.  You have to defeat Kefka before his troops
        reach Banon.  Your best bet is probably to take out all the soldiers
        then you can keep trying Kefka until you beat him.  Or you can make
        a party of four characters (with 2 and 1 in the other ones) and go
        straight for Kefka.  If done right you can dodge all the soldiers and
        get to Kefka before they are even halfway to Banon.  After the fight
        Terra will morph because of the Esper and fly away.
                        --IN SEARCH OF TERRA--
(1) Narshe
    Party: Pick four (3 if you want Shadow to join you a bit later) out of
                Locke, Cyan, Edgar, Sabin, Celes, or Gau
    Items: Check the clock in the Elder's house for Elixir
    Chests: Wall Ring, Sneak Ring, Hyperwrist, ThiefKnife, Earrings, 5000 GP
        You can sleep in the bed in the back room of the Weapon Shop.  If
        you go north to the mines and look at the little black hole to the
        upper right of the entrance you'll see Umaro the sasquatch (he'll
        join you later). Upon exiting go to Figaro (its in the same spot it
        was before).

(2) Figaro
        Enter the castle and go down the stairs to you left.  Talk to the guy
        and he'll take you (and the rest of Figaro Castle) past the mountains
        to a point near Kohlingen (your next destination). Just exit Figaro
        and go north.  If you have both Edgar and Sabin in your party you'll
        learn more about their past if you go to the spot where you can sleep.
        If you enter the main part of Figaro and shop put Edgar at the head of
        your party and the shopkeepers will give you a 50% discount.

(17)Kohlingen
    Chests: Green Beret
    Items: Check the clock in Rachel's house for Elixir
           Check a pot in the hut northwest of Kohlingen for Hero Ring
        Shadow is in the Cafe.  If you have less than 4 in you party he'll
        join you for 3000 GP.  If you have 4 and you want him to join you
        go back to Figaro and have the guy in the basement return Figaro back
        to where it was.  Then go back to Narshe and talk to one of your
        companions.  Change your party so it only has three members.  Now
        come back to Kohlingen the way you did before.  If you have Locke and
        go to the house in the top left corner you'll see a flashback telling
        why Locke is so keen on keeping his word about protecting Terra and
        Celes.  The house on the top right will also show a flashback if you
        have Locke and if you go behind the house and push down you'll find
        a back entrance to this house which leads to a chest.  From
        Kohlingen go south to Jidoor or you can go northwest to a hut where
        you'll find a Hero Ring in a pot then go south to Jidoor.

(18)Jidoor
    Items: in the very top house check a pot for Tincture
        From here head north (on the right side of the mountains) to Zozo.
        Take a Chocobo for a faster trip.  Just follow the light green strip
        of grass.

                X-Potion

                for Potion
    BOSS: Dadaluma
    Espers: Ramuh, Stray, Siren, Kirin
        In the building marked Inn there is a clock you are supposed to reset.
        The correct time is 6:10:50.  Setting the clock open a secret passage
        where a chest containing a Chain Saw is.  The building marked as
        Armor Shop has a chest with a Tonic.  Go to the building marked as the
        Relic Shop.  Go up as far as you can and you'll find a chest with the
        ThiefGlove.  From there go back down to the floor with the doorless
        doorway (just below the guy jumping from window to window).  Push
        over against the window and you'll jump across.  Keep going up, jumping
        from building to building where need be, and eventually you'll reach
        Terra.  Before you reach Terra you'll have to near Dadaluma.  After
        reaching Terra you'll get 4 Espers: Ramuh, Stray, Siren, and Kirin.
        There are also two chests on each side of this room.  Once your done
        go down and talk to one of your other three companions that just
        arrived.  Everyone goes back down the building and you find yourself
        back at the entrance of Zozo where your party will break up into two
        groups: one consists of Celes, Locke, and two others of your choice.
        Shadow splits again so you can't choose him.  This group is the one
        you'll control to get to your next destination.  The other two
        companions will return to Narshe.  Next stop: Jidoor again.

(18)Jidoor
        Go to the big house at the far north of town.  Here you'll find the
        director of the Opera.  As he leaves he drops a letter.  Read it and
        you find out about Setzer, the wandering gambler who owns an airship
        (which you need).  From Jidoor go south to the Opera House (taking a
        Chocobo makes the trip much faster).

(20)Opera House
    BOSS: Ultros
        Celes looks like the opera singer Maria, so she takes her place in
        order to get to Setzer.  As Celes you have to sing the right parts
        of the song (the full song is printed in the book in Celes' dressing
        room).  The correct parts are:
                        Oh, my hero...
                        I'm the darkness...
                        Must I...
        If you sing the wrong part you'll get kicked out of the opera house.
        Re-enter and the director will let you try again.  You only get four
        tries to get it right before it's game over.  Once you get it right,
        keep talking to the guy who comes out.  Then when he disappears grab
        the flowers then go up to the platform on the top floor.  If you take
        too much time doing any of this you'll get kicked out again and will
        have to start over from the beginning of the singing part again.
        Take Locke and read the letter in the dressing room.  Now return to
        the balcony and talk to Impressario.  Once Ultros shows himself on
        the girders with a 4 ton weight poised over Celes' head, you'll have
        5 minutes to get to him. First you have to go northeast where you'll
        find a guy who tells you to pull the far right switch, do this then
        return to Impressario and go to the northwest side of the balcony
        where you'll find your way onto the girders.  Navigate the girders
        and make it to Ultros.  When you're done Setzer will come and grab
        Celes.  After some convincing (with a nice double-headed coin)
        Setzer will take you to your next destination in his airship.
        (For more about the airship, see ON THE AIRSHIP).

(21)Albrook
    Items: Search the clock in the Cafe for Elixir
           Pot in weapon shop has Tincture
           Search barrel next to the Inn for Potion
        From Albrook head north past Vector and on up to the town of Tzen.
        (Going to Tzen and Maranda is not mandatory, you can go directly to
        Vector).

(22)Tzen
        Nothing here but some info and some decent weapons and armor.  From
        here go southwest to Maranda.

(23)Maranda
    Items: Search box to left of entrance of town for Revivify
           Search box on right side of town for Remedy
        The house in the top right corner is the house of the girl you were
        sending stuff to for that injured lad.  Next stop Vector.

(24)Vector
        The Inn says it free but sometimes when you're sleeping the keeper
        will steal 1000 GP.  In the skinny house there is an old woman asking
        if you pledge allegance to the Empire.  Answer "no" and two guards
        attack you. When you beat them and talk to the woman again she'll
        heal you.  Don't talk to any of the guards or you'll be attacked and
        sent back to the entrance.  If you go north to the Imperial Castle
        you'll get attacked by Guardian.  Run from it.  To the right of
        the Inn there is a guy hiding behind a box.  Talk to him.  Notice
        where he moves to.  When he distracts the guards go to that spot and
        push on the box.  Now go north and you'll be at the MagiTek Factory.

    BOSS: Ifrit, Shiva, Number 024, Number 128, Cranes
    Espers: Ifrit, Shiva, Unicorn, Maduin, Shoat, Phantom, Carbunkl, Bismark
        Go down the stairs and go to where the little hook is moving back and
        forth.  Push A to jump onto it.  Get the chest and the jump back
        across.  Now go right and enter the second little pipe that is to the
        right of the stairs.  Grab the chest then climb back thru the pipe
        and enter the first pipe.  Grab the treasure and go across the conveyer
        belt for another two treasures.  Now get on the conveyer belt to go
        down a level.  Down here you'll find 5 chests: one on the left side,
        one on the right side, one through a door just to the left of
        where you entered, one at the bottom (you can see it when you go
        down on from where you entered but you have to go around and underneath
        to get it), and one in a small room to the east of the room with the
        gold helmet in it.  On the right wall there is a spot where you can
        go between two walls to enter a pipe which leads to 2 more chests.
        When you're ready step onto the conveyer belt to the right of where the

        last belt dropped you off.  You'll see Kefka push a couple of Espers
        onto a conveyer belt.  When you can move, follow the Espers.  Go over
        and talk to the Esper on the left.  You'll now have to fight Ifrit and
        Shiva.  They'll give you their powers as magicite when you defeat them.
        Now, entering the left door you'll find a save spot.  The right
        door is the way out.  After you go up a bunch of stairs you'll come to
        a hall with the Esper holding tanks in them.  There is a hidden chest
        in this room.  Go to the far left end of the hall.  Now go down nect
        to the holding tank and search around.  You'll find the Break Blade.
        After the hall you'll reach the exit with Number 024 blocking it.
        After you beat Number 024 you'll enter a room with Espers floating
        in tanks.  Go to the far north wall and press the switch.  You'll
        get the Espers: Unicorn, Maduin, Shoat, Phantom, Carbunkl, and
        Bismark.  Kefka comes out and Celes zaps herself, Kefka, and his
        guards away.  Follow Cid. Talk to Cid. Ride the rails.  At the end
        of the mine cart ride you'll have to fight Number 128.  You'll now
        be back in town.  Follow the rails and you'll be back in the main
        part of town where Setzer will come and get you.  As you attempt
        to get away in the airship you'll be attacked by 2 Cranes.  Once
        you defeat the cranes, you'll go back to Zozo automatically.

(19)Zozo
        You'll automatically be in Terra's room.  A magicite will glow and
        Terra will remember.  You now control Maduin, the Esper and Terra's
        father, in the Esper's world.  This part is fairly straightforward.
        After the flashback you'll be in control of the airship.  You can go
        where ever you want now.  Narshe is your next destination.

(1) Narshe
    Items: Gold Hairpin (if you don't get Mog)
    Points of interest: New stuff in the weapon  and armor shops
        As you enter a guard will appear and take you to Banon.  From here
        go to the house with the locked treasure chest.  You'll find Lone Wolf
        the pickpocket.  He escapes and the chest is empty.  Follow him north
        to the mines.  If you keep following you'll eventually reach him up
        where the Esper in ice is.  He's holding a Moogle hostage.  Just hold
        still for a bit and the Moogle will escape.  Now you have a choice:
        go over and talk to the Moogle and he joins your party and Lone Wolf
        drops over the cliff, OR talk to Lone Wolf and you'll get Gold Hairpin
        and then both Lone Wolf and Mog drops over the cliff.  Now return to
        town, do whatever shopping you want and go to the airship.
        
     Getting Mog's Water Rondo Dance
     Espers: Golem, Zoneseek
        There are 3 different ways to get Mog's water rondo.  For all of them
        you need Mog in your party (DUH! :). So, add Mog to your party and...
        METHOD 1: return to Crescent Mountain.  Enter and jump into
                  the "Serpent Trench".  When you get out of the trench you'll
                  be in Nikeah.  Exit Nikeah (DO NOT GET ON THE SHIP!!) and go
                  north (to make the long trip back to the airship a lot faster
                  grab a Chocobo inside Nikeah).  Keep going and you'll
                  eventually reach the hut where Sabin's scenerio started.
                  From here go back thru where the Imperial Base was, thru the
                  Phantom Forest, jump off at Barren Falls, and finally you're
                  back on the Veldt.  Go get your airship and continue the game
.
        METHOD 2: This way is the longest but you can get almost all of Mog's
                  dances doing it this way.  Land your airship at the entrance
                  to the Returner's hideout and jump on the raft on the Lete
                  River.  This time the raft will go the way Sabin went the
                  first time and you'll end up near Gau's father's house.
                  From here you have to go thru Sabin's scenerio and hop on
                  the boat To South Figaro in Nikeah.  Once in South Figaro
                  it's kinda cool:  the captain of the ship smuggles you into
                  town in a treasure chest :)  Now you have to go all the way
                  thru Mt. Kolts again and you'll finally be to the point
                  where you can retrieve the airship.
        METHOD 3: This was is short and fast.  Land the airship at Nikeah.
                  Take a Chocobo from here and go to Baren Falls.  Jump in
                  and then go to the Serpent's Trench which will take you
                  back to Nikeah where the airship is waiting.
        Once you have Mog's water rondo go to the Imperial Base next to the
        bridge to the east of Vector.  The Auction House in Jidoor is now open
        making it possible to get Golem and Zoneseek now [see THE AUCTION HOUSE
        for more info].

    Imperial Base
        If you enter without Terra you'll be kicked out.  So if you don't have
        Terra return to the airship and change party members.  In the building
        is a treasure room with a locked door.  Make your way thru to the
        other side of the base and exit.  Head east and you'll enter the Cave
        to the Sealed Gate.

(25)Cave to the Sealed Gate
    Chests: Assassin, Tempest, Coin Toss, X-Potion, 3 Ethers, Genji Glove,
            Tent, Inviz Edge, Water Skean, Remedy, 2000 GP, Elixir,
            3 Magicites, Atma Weapon
        In the room after the one with the moving bridges, pull the switch
        on the bridge.  Now follow the left path to reach a chest with Genji
        Glove.  Now go back and take the right path.  Go up and pull the left
        switch.  Enter the doorway that appears, get the chest, and save your
        game.  Pulling the right switch makes you fight Ninja.  Pull the switch
        on the next bridge and go down to the stairway it makes.  Search the
        ground in the area that is below the stairway, there are 4 hidden
        treasures: 1 to the left of the stairs, 1 a couple steps above the
        hole going right, 1 a couple steps to the left of the slope that
        leads up to the chest, and 1 a few steps above the chests.  This is
        the treasure that the Ninja refers to when you defeat him. Go thru the
        hole after you get the chest and hidden stuff.  Step on both switches
        you can see. Go down and then left.  Step on that switch and enter the
        door that appears.  After getting the treasure leave the room and go
        right to the far bridge and then up.  Pull the switch, cross the
        bridge, and pull another switch.  Go up and left across the brides.
        Flick the switch inside the chest and return back to your right.  Grab
        the chest up the stairs then go down and exit the room.  Go up the
        stairs in the next room and your at the Sealed Gate.  Now you have to
        fight Kefka again (kinda).  To get back to the airship all you need
        to do is go down and out, and then go back thru the Imperial Base.
        On the airship the Espers attack and you lose control of the ship,
        crashing just south of Maranda.  From here go northeast to Vector.

(24)Vector revisited - The Imperial Palace
    Chests: Back Guard, X-Potion, Tincture, Gale Hairpin, Revivify
    Points of interest: if you examine a toilet, you'll jump on it, squat,
                        and flush :)
    Additional items: It's possible to get a Tintinabar and Charm Bangle
        Go north to the Imperial Castle (the Guardian isn't here now).  Follow
        the guy who comes out to greet you on the stairs.  Talk to Gestahl.
        He'll invite you to a banquet, but before dinner you have four minutes
        to talk to as many of the 24 soldiers in the castle as you can. The
        more you talk to the better your reward.  Don't waste time getting
        treasures (you can get them later) and don't talk to Kefka (he rambles
        on forever).
        At the banquet:  During the banquet you'll be given choices.  Each
        choice is worth a certain amount of points.  The point system is as
        follows:
                Each guard talked to         : 1 pt each (24 pts total)
                Each guard fought            : 4 pts each (20 pts total)
                Who to toast?
                    To the Empire            : 2 pts
                    To the Returners         : 1 pt
                    To our hometowns         : 5 pts
                About Kefka?
                    Leave him in jail        : 5 pts
                    Let him go               : 1 pt
                    Execute him              : 3 pts
                About Doma?
                    What's done is done      : 1 pt
                    That was inexcusable     : 5 pts
                    Apologize again!!        : 3 pts
                About Celes?
                    Was she a spy?           : 1 pt
                    Celes is one of us       : 5 pts
                    We trust Celes           : 3 pts
                Any questions?               : 2 pts each
                                (-10 pts if a question is asked twice)
                About the Espers?
                    They've gone to far      : 5 pts
                    You unleashed their power: 2 pts
                Which question asked first?  : 5 pts
                Take a break                 : 5 pts
                Anything you'd like me to say?
                    All I want is peace      : 3 pts
                    The war is over          : 5 pts
                    I'm sorry                : 1 pt
                Do me a favor?
                    Say yes the first time   : 3pts
        Towards the middle of the banquet Cid will ask if you want to take a
        break.  If you answer yes you can walk around the room.  The four
        sentries at Gestahl's sides will 'test your strength' if you talk
        to them.  Return to the center seat when you're ready to continue
        the meal.  Terra and Locke decide to head to Albrook.  Before you go
        remember to go back for all the treasure you saw while talking to
        the soldiers.  As you leave the banquet hall a sentry will approach
        you and reward you for talking the soldiers.  You will now be rewarded
        based on the above point system as follows:
          0-49 pts: Imperial troops withdraw from South Figaro
         50-66 pts: Imperial troops withdraw from Doma
         67-76 pts: The locked door in the house in the Imperial Base will
                                                                 be unlocked.
         77-89 pts: You get Tintinabar.
         90-93 pts: You get Charm Bangle.
        When you're done in Vector, return to the Imperial Base if you got
        the reward that unlocks the treasure room.  If not go to Tzen.

    Imperial Base Again
    Chests: Cherub Down, X-Potion, 8000 GP, Ether, Cure Ring, Back Guard,
            2 Elixirs, RunningShoes, 20000 GP, Wall Ring, 13000 GP
    Items: Check the stove for Flame Sabre
        Go the house and down the stairs.  The door is now unlocked if you
        got that reward in Vector.  Grab all the treasure (there is a hidden
        chest in the bottom righthand corner of the room).  Now leave the base
        and go west to Tzen.

(22)Tzen
    Espers: Sraphim
        Talk to the guy hiding in the trees behind the Relic Shop.  He'll sell
        you the Esper Sraphim for 3000 GP.  If you get Sraphim now you'll be
        out 3000 GP but you'll have more time to have it equipped.  If, however
,
        you wait until the World of Ruin you can buy it from the same guy for
        a measly 10 GP.

(21)Albrook
    Items: search box on right side of docks for Warp Stone
    Party: Locke, Terra
        Go the dock and get on the boat.  Talk to General Leo.  After you're
        thru there, go to the Inn and take a nap.  When you wake up return
        to the ship and talk to Leo and your on your way.

(27)Thamasa
    Party: Locke, Terra, Shadow
    Items: Check the middle barrel by the item shop for Eyedrop
           Check a barrel by the Relic shop for Soft
           Check a barrel by the Elder's house for Echo Screen
           Check a barrel by Strago's house for Green Cherry
           Check left wall in the upstairs of Strago's house for Memento Ring
        Once your ship lands, follow the light green path and then go out onto
        the peninsula to get to Thamasa.  Notice the Inn costs a lot
        (1500 GP !!), after you talk to Strago, it'll only cost 1 GP (cool
        beans :).  After talking to Strago, go to the Inn and take a nap.
        In the middle of the night Strago will come in and wake you up. His
        grand-daughter Relm is in a house that's on fire.  Talk to Strago
        outside the burning house.  He'll join you and you'll have to go
        in to save Relm.

(27)Inside the Burning House
    Party: Locke, Terra, Strago
    Chests: Fire Rod, Ice Rod
    BOSS: FlameEater
        If you touch any of the roaming flames you'll be attacked by Balloons.
        I suggest you equip someone with Shiva.  When you come to a choice
        of two doors pick the right one.  You'll get attacked if you enter
        the left one.  You'll now have a choice of two more doors.  The right
        one has a chest in it.  The left one leads you to two more doors.
        The right one has an Ice Rod, and the left leads upstairs.  Once
        upstairs you'll meet the source of the flames - FlameEater.  After
        you defeat FlameEater you'll find Relm.  After saving you, Shadow
        will split (yet again).  Now, with Strago, go west along the mountains
        and you'll find your next destination - a cave.

(28)Gathering Place of the Espers
    Party: Locke, Terra, Strago
    Chests: Heal Rod, X-Potion, Tabby Suit, Chocobo Suit
    BOSS: Ultros
        In the first room there are 3 exits.  The left one and the top one
        lead to one another so the right one is the correct way to go.  After
        a bit you'll reach three statues, the source of all magic.  As you
        walk away from the statues your pal Ultros attacks.  If you kill Ultros
        with the Vanish/Doom technique Relm will still take credit for helping
        defeat him even though she had nothing to do with it :)  When you get t
o
        the room with the save spot step onto one of the squares on the floor.
        You'll fall down a level.  The rightmost hole leads to a chest, the
        top left hole leads to another two chests, and the bottom left hole
        leads to the Espers.

(27)Back in Thamasa
    BOSS: Kefka (you fight against him with General Leo)
        This is almost like a fake ending: the Espers and the humans have
        reached an agreement and everyone is happy.... then Kefka shows up.
        You now have control of General Leo.  If you try to leave town you'll
        be attacked by the invincible Guardian.  Go talk to Kefka, you'll have
        to fight him. It doesn't matter how you fight him, you're going to
        win (or so you think).  You now have control of the airship again.
        If you re-enter Thamasa you'll find Strago's friend Gungho and you'll
        learn more about Hidon (who you can defeat later).  When you're ready
        enter the airship.  The island with the Sealed Gate on it will break
        off and float up into the sky.  When you're ready go and find the
        floating continent. Pick a party of 3 and you're on your way.

    On the way to the Floating Island
    BOSS: Ultros, Chupon, Air Force
        Before reaching the Floating Island you'll have to fight a whole
        bunch of Sky Armors and Spit Fires, and then when you're almost there
        you get to fight you good buddy Ultros, but this time he's brought
        his friend Chupon.  After Chupon sneezes you away (if you kill Ultros
        before Chupon appears using the Vanish/Doom trick Chupon won't show
        up and instead of being sneezed off you'll just kinda jump off :),
        you'll fall off the airship and have to fight Air Force.  After
        defeating it you'll land on the Floating Island.

    Floating Island
    Chests (Blue orbs): Murasame, Monster-in-a-box(Gigantos), Beret, Elixir
    Additional items: Gigantos gives you Hardened
    BOSS: AtmaWeapon, Nerapa
        You'll land near a save spot.  And just a little below that you'll
        see Shadow.  He'll join you when you talk to him.  Go right and you'll
        come to a stairway leading to a seemingly solid wall. Just press up
        against the wall and it'll open up.  When you come to a blue orb,
        examine it and you'll get Murasame.  Go as far as you can to the right
        and push down along the wall until you find a path leading to another
        blue orb.  This one has a monster-in-a-box, namely Gigantos.  When
        you beat it you get the Hardened.  Now go back to your left a little
        until you see a indentation on the upper wall.  Press you here and a
        passage will open up.  Go up and step into the center of the square.
        When you reappear go down as far as you can and then press up into the
        indentation on your right.  Now go right and down and right again.
        Follow this path and enter the transporter.  Now enter the bottom
        left transporter.  Go down and step on the switch and then go up and
        step on another switch.  Now go down and left until you come to stairs
        going down.  Go down as far as you can and then go right.  Follow this
        path until you have a choice of going left or right.  Go right and
        step on the switch.  Before entering the path that opens, go to your
        far right and get a Beret from the blue orb.  Now go back to the
        transporter and go down to another transporter which leads to a save
        spot.  Save your game and then go back up and enter the other
        transporter.  When you go down the stairs you have a choice of
        returning to the airship (if you do return to the airship, Shadow
        will leave the party, but he'll be waiting for you in the same
        spot he was before, so when you come back to the Floating Island
        you can get him again).  Go left and up where you'll meet AtmaWeapon.
        After defeating it, Shadow splits again.  Go up and you'll
        find Kefka and Gestahl.  Celes comes and join you.  Kefka moves the
        Goddesses out of alignment.  When Shadow comes back run like crazy.
        You have 6 minutes to get away.  To get the blue orb containing an
        Elixir go around to the right side and then go up to it (approaching
        it from the left side will cause the floor to fall away).  Once
        you reach something that looks like a save spot, examine it and you'll
        fight Nerapa.  After you beat Nerapa run to the edge and choose 'wait'
        twice then just sit there. When there is 5 seconds left Shadow will
        come and jump with you.  This is the end of the World of Balance.
                        --World of Ruin - One Year Later--
(1) Solitary Island
        You wake up as Celes on a small island.  It seems you and Cid are the
        only ones there.  Leave the house and go south to the beach.  Catch
        the fish and return to Cid.  You can save Cid from dying by feeding
        him the fast-moving fish or kill him by feeding him the slow-moving
        fish (or just not feeding him). If Cid dies then Celes will go throw
        herself off a cliff, else Cid will just show her the raft and the
        following about the seagull won't happen.  The seagull will nurse
        her back to health.  Return to the house and read the letter
        next to the bed.  Follow its instructions by going down the stairway
        hidden in the lefthand wall.  There you'll find a raft.  Examine it
        and you're on your way to Albrook. Note: Don't forget to equip yourself
.

(2) Albrook
    Party: Celes
        A man was here looking for his friends.  He said he was going north,
        to Tzen.  Ok, so go to Tzen.

    Espers: Sraphim (if you didn't buy it in the World of Balance)
        As you walk up the stairs to enter the town, the "Light of Judgment"
        hits the town.  Go to the back of town to where Sabin is holding up
        a house.  If you don't have a Jewel Ring go to the Relic Shop and
        buy one.  Equip it and enter the house.  You have 6 minutes to save
        the kid and get out.  So save the kid and the get as many treasures
        as you can leaving yourself enough time to get out.  Avoid two chests:
        the one next to the stairs going down and the one to the left of the
        kid.  When you get out safely, Sabin will join you.  If you didn't
        buy the Sraphim Esper in the World of Balance, you can now for 10 GP.
        Leave town and go to the far east to Mobliz.

(4) Mobliz
    Party: Celes, Sabin
    Items: Check barrel next to far left house for Fenix Down
    BOSS: Phunbaba
    Espers: Fenrir
        Go into the house the kid enters and then down stairs.  Here you find
        Terra.  After the flashback, leave the cave and Phunbaba attacks the
        village.  Terra tries fighting it but is defeated easily.  It's up
        to Celes and Sabin. After scaring it away Terra won't go with you but
        a kid will give you the Esper Fenrir.  Now leave town and head
        northwest to Nikeah.

(5) Nikeah
        Enter the Cafe and talk to everyone.  Go out and follow the thieves
        onto the ship.  Now go back into town and talk to Gerad (across from
        the Armor Shop).  Follow him.  You're now on your way to South Figaro.

(6) South Figaro
    Items: if you didn't get the items in the barrels and boxes in the
           World of Balance, then search them now to get:
              Fenix Down, Elixir, Tent, Remedy, X-Potion
        Go to the Cafe. Go into the door marked Inn and straight through to
        Gerad's room.  After talking to Gerad (AKA Edgar) the thieves  will
        leave town.  When you're done shopping head west to the Cave of Figaro.

(7) Cave of Figaro
    Chests: Hero Ring, Ether, X-Potion (if you haven't gotten them yet)
        As you enter you'll find Sigfried.  He says to wait there but don't
        listen to him. There is nothing new in this part of the cave since the
        lst time you were here so just keep going until you reach the thieves.
        Follow their example and jump onto the turtle.  This part of the cave
        is new to you but all the chests have been looted already, however
        in the second section you can go up to where you'll find Siegfried
        messing around with a chest and when you approach he runs off.  If you
        continue going you'll reach the basement of Figaro Castle.

(8) Basement of Figaro Castle
    Chests: Gravity Rod, Crystal Helm, Ether, X-Potion, Regal Crown
    Item: Search statue in treasure room for Soul Sabre
    BOSS: Tentacles
        Go up the stairs and then continue straight down the other stairs.
        Keep going down.  Eventually you'll reach a room with 3 doors and 4
        chests.  The right door is where you enter this room.  The left door
        leads upstairs to a chest and the middles door leads to Edgar (er...
        Gerad).  Talk to Gerad and he'll finally admit he's Edgar.  He then
        joins your party, just in time to fight 4 Tentacles.  When you've
        beat it, go into the back room and search the statue in the center
        of the room for Soul Sabre.  Now turn around and back track your way
        out of the castle.  As you're going up the stairs the old guy near
        the exit will bring the castle to the surface.  You can go upstairs
        and do some shopping.  When you're ready to go return to the old man
        and have him take you to Kohlingen.

(9) Kohlingen
    Party: Celes, Sabin, Edgar
        Enter the Inn/Cafe.  Here you'll find Setzer, who'll join your party.

    Additional items: Presenter gives you Dragon Claw
    BOSS: Dullahan
        Go down to Basement 2.  First go left and down.  Grab the chest and
        go north thru the doorway.  Press the switch in the turtle pond.  Then
        go back to the room with the stairs going up and the chest in the
        middle.  Walk down until all you can see is your head, then walk right,
        through the wall.  Go up to the treasure chest when you can't go any
        further and you can get Exp.Egg.  Return the way you came, go up the
        stairs, and then go north through the door and then east as far as
        you can.  Go up thru the door and examine the gravestone.  Go up and
        press the switch and then go south and grab the treasure.  Return
        north and then go west and south thru the indentation.  Jump on the
        turtle and it'll take you across the water.  When you get off press
        the switch then go south.  Examine the four gravestones:
                ERAU    QSSI
                DLRO    WHET
        Now go north past the room with the turtle on your right and into the
        big room where you started Basement 2.  Go west and north thru the
        door.  Examine the gravestone and carve in the following order:
                WEHT DLRO QSSI ERAU
        "The World Is Square" backwards.  This tells you where the Exp.Egg
        is (just in case you didn't read above ;)  Now return to the room
        with the turtle on your right and hop on it.  You're now in a room
        with a save spot and 2 chests.  The left one is a monster-in-a-box.
        Defeat the Presenter and you get Dragon Claw.  Once you get the
        treasures go up and examine the big statue.  This will cause
        Dullahan to attack.  After you defeat it a passage will open up in
        the back, enter it and you've got yourself a new airship.  Now you
        can go get Sabin his most powerful Blitz at Duncan's House (it's where
        5 trees make a plus (+) sign just below some mountains.  His house
        is the center tree).

(22)Duncan's House
    Party: Include Sabin
        Make sure you have Sabin in your party.  As you enter the house
        Duncan will come out and teach Sabin the Bum Rush blitz.

(11)Maranda
    Items: Lola's Letter (Rare item)
        Go to Lola's house and talk to her.  Read the letter she places on

        and go where the pigeon went (which is Zozo).

(12)Zozo
    Items: Rust-Rid is here (Rare item)
        Go over and talk to the guy in front of the building marked Inn.  Buy
        the Rust-Rid from him for 1000 GP.  Now enter the building marked Cafe
        and climb until you reach the door that is rusted shut.  You can now
        enter it and go to Mt. Zozo.

(12)Mt. Zozo
    Chests: Red Cap, Ice Shld, Thunder Shld, Aegis Shld, Gold Hairpin,
            Machinery Manual, Book of Secrets
    Additional items: Storm Drgn gives you Force Armor
    BOSS: Storm Drgn (**DRAGON #1**)
        The 1st section is straight forward, just walk around getting treasure.
        At the end of the 1st section you'll find two exits.  The left one
        gets you more treasure and the right one continues onward.  Eventually
        you'll find Cyan.  After you have control again return to where you
        found Cyan and get the key to the locked chest.  Now return to the
        save spot and then go over and step on the switch.  This will release
        the Storm Drgn.  After you beat it you'll get Force Armor.  Only 7
        more dragons to go.  Now back track your way out of the cave (or use
        the warp stone/spell).  Once you're out return to the airship and head
        towards the cave in the Veldt.

(13)Cave in the Veldt
    Chests: Rage Ring, Monster-in-a-box(Allo Ver), Striker
    Additional items: Allo Ver gives you Tiger Fangs
    BOSS: SrBehemoth (Gray and Pink)
        When you defeat Allo Ver you get Tiger Fangs.  In that wall you
        walked thru to get to the monster-in-a-box, you can also go down
        in a spot to reach another section of the cave.  Follow the path
        and eventually you'll reach a door with a switch to the right of it.
        Pull the switch and go through the path it opens.  Continue
        following this path and eventually you'll find Shadow (or Relm if you
        abandoned Shadow back on the Floating Island).  As you're examining
        his wounds you're attacked by a SrBehemoth.  After defeating the
        SrBehemoths you'll take Shadow (or Relm) to Thamasa.

(14)Thamasa
        Go to the Inn and rest.  When you wake up return to Shadow and check
        up on him.  How return to the airship, reduce your party to 3 members,
        and go back to the Veldt.  You'll see more of Shadow (or Relm) later.

    Veldt
    Party: 3 members
        Wander around until Gau joins you.  Now return to the small island
        you started at.  If you return to Thamasa you'll find out that
        Shadow has gone to the Colosseum (that is if Shadow is still alive).
        If you take Sabin and Gau to the shack located on the big island
        north of the Veldt, you'll learn more about Gau's past.

(1) Solitary Island
    Espers: Palidor
        Go to the beach where you caught the fish for Cid.  Here you'll find
        the Esper Palidor.  Return to the airship and go to the Colosseum.

(15)Colosseum
        Here you'll find some information.  You can also fight monsters
        one-on-one for prizes.  Bet the Striker (found in the cave in the
        Veldt) and you'll fight Shadow.  He'll join you after the fight.
        When you're done playing around in the Colosseum return to the
        airship and go to Jidoor.

(16)Jidoor
    Chests [in the house]: Moogle Suit, Relic Ring, 2000 GP, Potion, Ether,
                            Remedy
    Additional items: search Gestahl's portrait twice = Royal Letter (Rare item
)
    BOSS: Chadarnook
    Esper: Starlet
        You can bid in the auction house if you didn't before going to the
        Floating Island (see section called The Auction House for more).  Enter

        the big house at the north part of town.  Try going up the stairs.
        You'll be pushed back and a book will appear on the desk.  Read it.  Go

        to the light next to the stairs and push A to turn it on.  Examine the
        picture of Emperor Gestahl twice and you'll receive information.
        Examine the picture of the flowers and you'll be attacked by some
        Nightshade.  Now examine the picture of a lovely lady. This time you'll

        be attacked by Dahlings.  Kill them and enter the door that appears.
        Examine the picture of a chair and you'll be attacked by Souldancer and

        some Wild Cats.  The left door leads to a chest.  After getting the
        chest go through the right door.  You'll come to some "revolving
        doors".  In the little pathway behind the doors there is a hidden
        chest.  The middle and right doors take you back to the room with a
        picture of a chair.  Obviously the left door is the right way to go :)

        Keep going and you'll come to a room with some floating chests.  Walk
        underneath them and they'll fall (and you'll get attacked).  Examine
        the picture of armor and you'll have to fight Still Life.
        Enter the door that appears when you defeat it.  You're
        now in a room with a save spot and 2 doors.  The left one takes you
        back a few rooms.  The right one leads to a big room where you find
        Owzer and Relm.  Talk to Owzer and you'll find out what happened and
        will be asked to defeat Chadarnook, the monster in the painting.
        After you defeat it you can get the Esper Starlet by examining the
        book case and Relm will join you.
        Now exit the town and add Cyan to your party (if he's not already in
        it).  Go back to Maranda and talk to Lola.  Examine the letter on the
        desk and Cyan will switch it with another one.  Now return to
        Mobliz.

(4) Mobliz
    Items: Examine the pot in the cave where Terra & Katarin are for Ether
    BOSS: Phunbaba
        Go down to the cave where you first found Terra.  All the kids say
        Katarin is missing.  Exit the house and go to the house to the left
        of it.  Here you'll find Duane.  Notice where the dog went.  There's
        a secret passage behind the bookshelf.  Here you'll find Terra and
        Katarin.  While you're down there, Phunbaba will return.  You'll
        have to defeat him again.  Return to the surface and you'll face it.
        After defeating it, Terra is back in your party.  The characters that
        Phunbaba blew away are on the airship.  Return to the airship and go
        either fight Doom Gaze or go to the Fanatics' Tower.

    Fight Doom Gaze
    BOSS: Doom Gaze
    Esper: Bahamut
        At this point it may be a good idea to fight Doom Gaze.  Fly around
        the map and eventually he'll attack you.  He escapes after a while
        but the next time you meet with it, its hps will not have regenerated.
        So if you continue to run into it, eventually you'll kill it.  And
        when you do the Esper Bahamut is yours.  You may want to fly around
        until you defeat it.  It's worth it to get Bahamut.

(20)Fanatics' Tower
        Before you enter put Relm in your party.  Now enter the tower.  Relm
        will get Strago's attention and he'll join you.  Don't actually try
        going up the tower yet, you`ll have your chance later.  For now
        return to the airship and go to the center of where the mountains
        form a star (north of Tzen).  Push B to descend.

(17) Phoenix Cave
     Party: 2 groups with 4 members each
     Chests: Wing Edge, Warp Stone, Ribbon, Dragon Horn
     BOSS: Red Dragon (**DRAGON #2**)
        Have your first group (G1) enter the cave and step on the switch.
        Now switch to your other group (G2) and have them enter the path that
        opened.  At the top of the stairs go left and try to get the chest.
        You'll fall down a level.  Go south and up the stairs.  Step on the
        switch and get the chest.  Go east past the stairs and down to a switch
.
        Change to G1 and enter the passage that opens when G2 stepped on the
        switch.  Step on the switch that you come to as you go north.  Switch
        back to G2 and go north past where the spikes were, and then right unti
l
        you come to another switch.  Step on it and switch back to G1 again.
        The chest is empty but go down and you should find a hidden room thru
        the wall containing a chest with a warp stone in it.  After you get it
        return to where you were and go down the stairs. Go left and
        step on the switch (the chest is empty).  Now turn around and go the
        opposite way.  Keep going past the chest (this one's empty too).
        When you come to a dead end switch to G2.  Go left, past the spikes,
        and down the stairs.  Go right onto the bridge and jump across on the
        little stones.  Turn around and go back on the top set of stones.
        Don't worry about the chest (it's empty).  Press the switch and change
        to G1.  Have G1 go up thru the spot that just opened and then around
        and back down to a switch.  Step on the switch and then change to G2.
        Go up and step on the switch you find.  Switch back to G1 again and
        go up, across the spot where the spikes were, and the down.  Jump
        from stone to stone.  Keep doing this and eventually you'll reach a
        stairway leading up.  Go up it and pull the switch you find.  Now go
        down as far as you can a switch back to G2.  Go left and step on the
        switch.  Switch back to G1 and go down where you'll find the Red
        Dragon. You can fight it now or wait until later.  Take G2 and go down
        and left.  Follow this path and you'll come to where the lava was
        cooled off.  Walk out and get the chest in the center (this one isn't
        empty :) then go over to the left side and go up.  Follow this path
        until you can't go any farther and switch to G1.  Go and step on the
        top switch.  Now have G2 jump across the stones that appeared and then
        have them go down and step on one of the switches then switch groups
        and have them step on the other switch.  Take you strongest group and
        go fight the Red Dragon (if you haven't already) and then after you
        kill it have the other group go down and you'll find Locke.  You'll
        now automatically return to Kohlingen.
        NOTE: If for some reason you return to the Phoenix Cave you can
              instantly return to the airship by going to where you found Locke
.
              Here you can press to the right and you'll hop over some rocks
              to a platform where you'll find the transporter (it looks like
              a red save spot).
(9) Kohlingen
    Items: X-Potion, Fenix Down, X-Ether, Elixir, Flame Shld, ValiantKnife
    Espers: Phoenix
        Here you'll receive the Esper Phoenix plus all the stuff that was in
        the chests that you found empty: X-Potion, Fenix Down, X-Ether, Elixir,
        Flame Shld, and ValiantKnife.  Now it's on to Narshe.

(18)Narshe
    Chests: Gauntlet, X-Ether, Monster-in-a-box(Pugs)
    Additional items: Cursed Shld, Moogle Charm,
                      Pugs may leave Minerva, possibly the
                      Ragnarok sword (depends on your choice), and possibly
                      a Ribbon, a Pod Bracelet, and an Elixir (depends on if
                      you already got the chests or not previously)
    BOSS: Ice Dragon (**DRAGON #3**), Tritoch, Umaro
    Espers: Ragnarok, Tritoch, Terrato
        As you enter Lone Wolf come out and tell you some stuff.  Almost all
        the buildings are locked.  If you have Locke he can open them.  Go
        to the house with no markings and have Locke get you in.  Inside
        you'll find a man in bed who'll give you Cursed Shld.  Equip this
        shield to someone.  It may be a pain for a while, but in 255 battles
        it'll all be worth it.  (Being equipped for 255 fights removes the
        curse and changes the shield into the Paladin Shld which teaches the
        Ultima spell [a Ribbon must be equipped to the person using the shield
        in order to uncurse it. It would make sense to have it equipped any
        way because it counteracts all the bad effects of the Cursed Shld --
        except Condemned, but, hey, you can't have everything :) ].
        Go to the Weapon Shop and have Locke get you in.  In the
        back room you'll find and old man.  Talk to him.  He'll give you a
        choice of either getting the Esper Ragnarok or making it into a sword.

        Tough choice: the sword is VERY powerful (and can be bet in the
        Colosseum for an even more powerful sword) but the Esper teaches you th
e
        most powerful spell in the game - Ultima.  Once you've decided (I'd go
        for the Esper) enter the mines thru the secret passage Locke showed you

        or thru the entrance behind Arvis' house, and then go to the Moogle Cav
e
        where you'll find Mog waiting to join you.  Once he's out of the way,
        search the wall behind him for the Moogle Charm [also in this cave
        is a chest that may contain a Ribbon if you didn't get the Rune Sword
        that was in it in the World of Balance].  If you explore the cave
        some more you'll find two other chests (the 1st two chests that Terra
        found in the beginning of the game).  If you haven't gotten them
        yet, they'll contain a Pod Bracelet and an Elixir.Return to the airship
        and add Mog to your party.  Now go back into Narshe and go north to the
        mines where you first saw Umaro (straight back from the entrance of
        town).  Once inside the mines take a right, and continue following
        that path until you reach the Ice Dragon.  You may want to go past
        the dragon to the save spot before fighting it.  After defeating it
        continue north to the frozen Esper Tritoch.  You'll have to fight it
        before you can have it.  Now go to the edge of the cliff and jump off.
        You'll land in a new area of the mines.  Wander around and you'll
        be able to find 3 chests.  The monster-in-a-box sometimes leaves
        Minerva armor. When you come to a switch, pass it up, cross the bridge
        and pull that switch.  When you fall down search the skull carving and
        you'll get the Esper Terrato.  Then Umaro will come down and attack
        you.  When you defeat him and if Mog is in your party, he'll join you.

        If you follow him out you'll end up just below the spot where you
        first saw Umaro.  Enter the mines to your left.  Follow that path and
        you're on your way out.  Once you're out of Narshe go to Triangle
        Island.

(19)Triangle Island
        Wander around until you get attacked.  The only monster on the island
        is the ZoneEater.  If you kill it it's worth 1000 xp, but in order
        to continue you must have all four of your characters get engulfed,
        so just sit there.  Once you get engulfed you'll be in a cave.

(19)Cave in Triangle Island
    Chests: Ether, Red Jacket, Genji Armor, Magical Brsh, FakeMustache,
                Zephyr Cape, Hero Ring, Tack Star, Thunder Shld
        To get out go north and step into the light.  To get Gogo go down and
        left.  Push A to jump from bridge to bridge but try not to touch
        the little green guys because they'll knock you down (get knocked
        down at least once for some treasure).  Once past the save spot you'll
        come to a room with a moving wall.  If you get caught by the wall
        you die.  To get past it, stop behind the first chest and go as soon
        as you can move.  Do the same for the second chest.  For the third
        chest go down from it and then when you can move go up and get
        the chest then quickly come back down again.  After that spot you come
        to a room with open chests.  Press A to jump onto a chest and then
        across.  When you can, jump across to the switch, now you can reach
        a treasure on the left side of the room.  When you're ready go thru
        the door.  Here you'll find Gogo the copycat.  He'll join you.  To
        get out you can either backtrack or use a warp stone/spell.  Next
        stop...Fanatics' Tower.

(20)Fanatic's Tower
    Party: I suggest taking Umaro, Gogo and your two best magic users.
    Chests: Safety Bit, Air Anchor, Genji Shld, Stunner, Force Armor, Gem Box
    Additional items: Pearl Lance
    BOSS: White Dragon (**DRAGON #4**), MagiMaster
        If you use Gogo make sure to add the Fight (yes Fight, not Magic)
        command to his list.  If you use Mog you can equip him with the
        Moogle Charm and put him in the lead for an easy time getting up
        the tower.  If you cast Bserk on your party they'll attack with weapons
        and you can save your mps for healing and stuff.  If you don't have
        Life3 then equip the Esper that teaches it and keep fighting until you
        learn it (you can beat the boss of the tower without Life3 but it takes
        a LONG time or a shit load of hps).  Each level has a doorway (there
        are four levels plus the roof).  In the first level door go to the
        right of the chest and press A.  When you leave you'll see another
        door below you.  Inside is an Air Anchor.  The third level door leads
        to the White Dragon.  You get Pearl Lance when you defeat it.  Once on
        the roof get the Gem Box and equip it to someone (the one with the best

        spells).  Now, if you have Life3 (or Rasp, Bserk, and the Fenrir Epser
        equipped to do it the long way) then exit the room,if not wander around

        the room and battle monsters until you get it (make sure the Esper
        equipped teaches it).  When you've got Life3 exit the room and try to
        leave.  You'll be stopped by the MagiMaster. After you defeat him you
        have to climb back down the tower (this is the time you'll want Mog in
        the lead with the Moogle Charm). Now go to Doma Castle.

(21)Doma Castle
    Party: Cyan and 3 others
    Chest: X-Potion, Fenix Down, Beads, Ether
    Items: Search a pot near the sleeping room for Remedy
           Search the clock in the room next to the sleeping room for Elixir
        Make sure you have Cyan in your party.  Go to the room to the right
        of the throne room for treasure.  Enter the door south of this room
        and follow the path until you reach a door which leads to a couple
        more chests.  Now return to the hall leading to the throne room.  Go
        south from the throne room door and then into the right door.  Search
        the pot then go left  and enter the second door you come to.  Get the
        chest and then go back and enter the door you passed up.  Take a nap.
        You will now enter Cyan's Soul.

(21)Cyan's Soul
    Party: the party you took to Doma Castle minus Cyan
    Chests: Genji Glove, Lump of metal, Flame Shld, X-Potion, Ice Shld
    BOSS: The 3 Dream Stooges, Wrexsoul
    Espers: Alexandr
        You start out with one of the 3 characters in a weird dreamworld.
        Head left and enter the right door and then the next right door.  Now
        you can go down and get another of your characters back.  Now enter

        the door, go right and enter that door.  Now go left again and this
        time enter the left door.  Go down and get your remaining character.
        Enter the door.  Now enter the top door, then the door on the right,
        and then the only door there.  Now go right and enter the door.  Go
        down and try entering the door.  Larry, Curly, and Moe will attack.
        Enter the door and you'll find yourself on a train.  Go left into the
        train car.  In the second car pull the switch twice as you enter and
        get the treasure.  Now go to the far left of the car and get the Lump
        of Metal from the chest.  Return right, to the open chest that moves.
        Push A and you'll put the Metal into the chest allowing you to get by
        it and get the chest in the back. Now go left and pull the switch,
        notice which chests close.  Continue left into the next car.  Notice
        there is a chest just to the left of the entrance on the other side of
        the couch.  There are 4 switches. To continue use them in the following

        order (they are numbered 1 to 4, from right to left): 1, 2, 1, 3.  Now
        you can reach switch #4. Before pulling it, close the chests so they
        match the set-up in the previous car:
                open    open    closed
                closed  closed  open
        Once you have the chests set up like above, pull the switch and the
        wall will open allowing you to go on to the next car.  Enter the
        engine room and then attempt to exit.  You'll find yourself in some
        mines.  Go down and follow the path until you re-enter the cave.  As
        soon as you enter the cave turn around and exit.  You'll end up in
        a new spot.  Trying to cross the bridge you'll fall and end up in the
        sleeping chambers of Doma Castle. Before going to the throne room
        where Wrexsoul awaits take some time to explore.  There are 3 little
        scenes that deal with Cyan's life that you can see: one in the
        room to the right of the throne room ('I loveth thee'), one on left
        side of the castle (fencing lesson), and one on the right side of
        the castle (fishing).  Go to the throne room where you'll find
        Wrexsoul.  After defeating Wrexsoul Cyan will rejoin your party capable

        of using all 8 SwdTechs and you'll wake up back in the sleeping
        chambers.  Go to the throne room and you'll find the Esper Alexandr.

(7) Figaro Castle
    Party: who ever you want
        Enter the castle and go down the stairs to you left.  Talk to the guy
        and have him take you back to Figaro.  On the way you'll get stuck.
        Stop and explore.  Go up the stairs and then down the other ones.
        In the back of the far right jail cell is a doorway.  Enter it and
        you'll be on your way to the Ancient Castle.

(23)Cave to Ancient Castle
    Chests: Ether, Wing Edge, Doom Darts, monster-in-a-box(Master Pug),
            Magicite, X-Potion
    Additional items: Gradeus
        When you defeat the Master Pug (monster-in-a-box) you'll receive
        Gradeus.  Once you reach a room with a stairway going down into a
        hole, get the two chests in that room then go down the stairs, past
        the save spot and up some stairs.  You're now at the Ancient Castle.

(23)Ancient Castle
    Chests: Blizzard Orb, Gold Hairpin, Punisher, Monster-in-a-box(KatanaSoul)

    Items: search a bucket for X-Ether
    Additional items: Offering,Scimitar
    BOSS: Blue Dragon (**DRAGON #5**)
    Espers: Odin, Raiden
        Go straight into the castle until you reach the statue of Odin.
        Examine it and you'll get the Esper Odin.  Stand on the right throne
        and walk five steps down.  Press A and a secret passage will open.
        In the secret room you'll find a statue of a girl and the Blue Dragon.
        Defeat the dragon then examine the statue.  This will change the
        Esper Odin into the Esper Raiden.  Once you've visited all four rooms
        that go off from the throne room (one on the left, one on the right,
        one to the north, plus the secret one) then return outside.  A couple
        steps to the right of the stairs is a door.  Enter and get the chest.
        Now enter one of the doors to the left of the stairs.  When you
        defeat the monster-in-a-box(KatanaSoul) you get Offering.  Now
        return to Figaro castle by going back the way you came and have the
        guy continue your journey to Figaro.  Once you get there talk to him
        again and have him take you back to Kohlingen so you can get your
        airship.  Now go to Thamasa.

(14)Thamasa
    Party: include Strago and Relm
        As you enter you'll find out that Gungho is hurt.  You find out that
        Hidon did it and that Gungho wants you to avenge him.  Now go to
        Ebot's Rock (called Eboshi Rock on the map).

(24)Ebot's Rock
    Chests: all the chests contain Coral
    BOSS: Hidon
        As you enter step on the switch to be transported.  North of where
        you appear is a Coral eating treasure chest.  Wander around the cave,
        stepping on switches to get around, and pick up coral from the chests.
        If you end up back at the coral eating chest, feed it.  If you've
        fed it enough he'll let you thru.  If not go get more coral.  Once
        it lets you thru go straight north and you'll find Hidon.  Kill
        the Hidonites and Hidon will cast Grand Train (Strago's most powerful
        Lore). After you beat Hidon you'll return to Thamasa to brag to Gungho.
        Now go to the Opera House.
        NOTE: To make Hidon reset all you have to do is talk to Gungho a few
              times.

(25)Opera House
    BOSS: Dirt Drgn (**DRAGON #6**)
    Additional Items:  Dirt Drgn may leave a Magus Rod
        Equip as many characters in your party as you can with Gaia stuff.
        If you have some on each character it'll make life much easier for
        you.  Go to the balcony and talk to Impressario.  You'll learn
        there is a dragon on the stage.  Go northeast to where the stage
        master and 4 switches are.  The rightmost switch won't do anything.
        The leftmost switch barks and the one right next to that turns the
        lights off.  Pulling the only one left will cause you to fall to
        the stage where you'll have to fight the Dirt Drgn.  To see your
        character jump on the heads of the audience go back to the switches
        after you defeat the dragon and pull the one that drops you to the
        stage.  Next and final stop -- Kefka's Tower.

(26)Kefka's Tower
    Party: 3 groups of 4
    Chests: Coronet, Fixed Dice, Minerva, 2 Tack Stars, Force Shld, Force Armor
                Ribbon (x2), Red Cap, Nutkin Suit, Gauntlet, Hero Ring,
                Aegis Shld, Megalixir, Rainbow Brsh
    Additional items: Crystal Orb, Muscle Belt, Sky Render, Excalibur, AuraLanc
e
    BOSS: Atma, Gold Dragon (**DRAGON #7**), Inferno,Skull Drgn (**DRAGON #8**)
,
          Doom, Goddess, Guardian, Poltrgiest, Kefka
    Espers: If you killed all 8 dragons you get Crusader
    Note: When you find the chest with the Hero Ring in it search the south
          wall to find a secret passage to a room where a chest is that
          contains an Aegis Shld.
        Your 3 groups will land in 3 different areas of the tower.  Each
        group will be designated as follows:  G1 will be the group that landed
        on the left side of the tower, G2 will be the group in the middle,
        and G3 will be the group on the right.  You start as G1.
        G1: Go around to your right and get the chest then enter the little
            hatchway to your left.  Continue on this path until you come to
            a dead end.  You should see a switch and a chest on the other
            side of the room.
        G2: When you have to choose between going up and down, go up first
            and get the treasure then go down.  Going down will lead to a
            prison.  In the far left cell you'll find Atma.  Defeat it and
            it'll change into a save spot.  Now go down out of the prison
            and continue on that path until you have to choose between two
            pipes.  Don't go in the rightmost pipe, it'll just take you back
            before the prison.  Enter the left pipe.  Before you enter the
            hatchway that you find, go to your far left to get a chest.
            Enter the hatchway, step on the switch and get the chest, then
            go back up and enter the door to you right.  Keep going staight
            and you'll reach the Gold Dragon.  After defeating it you get
            the Crystal Orb.  Now continue you journey.  When you reach a room
            with a switch, stand on it and switch groups.
        G3: First enter the hatchway that is next to the chest to get two more
            chests then come back and enter the other hatchway.  Continue on
            that path and you'll eventually reach a save spot.  A few more
            steps and you'll get attacked by Inferno, Striker, and Rough
            (a big ol' monster and it claws).  Once you've defeated them
            continue on your journey.  When you get to a chest with a glowing
            thing on it, examine it to open up a passage that your other group
            will need to get past.  Then keep going and you'll reach the
            Skull Drgn.  When you defeat it you'll get the Muscle Belt.  If
            you've killed the other 7 dragons, you'll also receive the Esper
            Crusader.  Keep going and you'll end up on the other side of the
            room you left G2 in.  Stand on the switch.
        G1: You are no longer at a dead end.  Follow the path and you'll
            eventually reach the room your other two groups are in.
            Continue straight and then, after you reach the switch, pick a
            side to go on (it doesn't matter which).  For illustrative
            purposes I'm gonna say go left.  Now go down.  Move G2 off the
            switch and then push the weight off the edge.  Now go back inside
            and stand on the switch.
        G2: Enter the main doorway and do what G1 did, except on the right
            side.
        G3: Go in through the main door and step on the switch.  This will
            open up a pathway.  Go south and step on the platform to open up
            a couple other pathways.
        G1: Go down and out to where you pushed the weight off.  To your left
            there is a door.  Enter the door and go straight where you'll find
            Doom.  When you beat it you'll get Sky Render and there will be
            a save spot there.  Now enter the pipe to the north and stand
            on the switch.
        G2: Go down and out to where you pushed the weight off.  To your right
            is a door.  Enter the door and go straight where you'll find
            Goddess.  When you beat it you'll get Excalibur and there will
            be a save spot there.  Enter the door and step on the switch.
        G3: Go north and you'll be attacked by Guardian (remember it? this
            time you can beat it thought :)  When you defeat it a save spot
            will be there. Go north through the door, then to the left and
            down through another door.  Search the wall below and to the
            right of you to find a Ribbon.  Now go up and battle
            Poltrgeist. Defeating it will get you the AuraLance.  Go
            north and drop down the hole.  Step on the switch and it's time
            for the final multi-battle showdown.
        Put your characters in the order you want them to fight.  The first
        4 in your list will fight 1st.  If anyone of those 4 are dead at the
        end of any of the stages of the last fight the next characters in
        line will replace them.  This goes on until all 4 fighting members
        die or you beat the game.

        For each boss there is a section marked VANISH/DOOM.  If it is marked
        yes then you can cast Vanish on it and then Doom on it to kill it.
        In place of Doom you could also cast X-Zone.  On some monsters only
        X-Zone will work (those are marked X-Zone only).

          First kill the Ipoohs (you have no choice).  Have Terra cure, Locke
          fight, and Edgar use AutoCrossbow.  When Sabin fights have him use
          Pummel, that will finish him.

          Depending on who's in the group you fight him with will determine
          how hard he is.  Those that can't do much damage will take longer
          to defeat him.  Here is my strategies for each person:
               Terra - cure or attack           Locke - attack
               Edgar - AutoCrossbow             Sabin - AuraBolt
               Celes - Runic                    Cyan  - SwdTech 1
               Gau   - Templar

                VANISH/DOOM: no
          Locke - attack         Edgar - Chainsaw or Drill
          Sabin - AuraBolt       Celes - attack
          Cyan - SwdTech 1       Gau   - ????
   Ultros(Opera House) HP: 2550     MP: 500      Weakness: fire,lightning
                VANISH/DOOM: no
          Have someone equipped with the Ramuh Esper and have them use it.
          Then have Locke attack, Edgar use Chainsaw or Drill, Sabin AuraBolt,
          Cyan use SwdTech 1, and Gau ????.  One attack from Ramuh and one
          Chainsaw attack from Edgar should be enough to finish him.

                VANISH/DOOM: yes (for both)
          Use your most powerful Fire and Bolt spells (fire 2 gets a lot
          of damage) on Ultros.  Take out Ultros first and then go for Chupon.
          Fire spell heal Chupon so don't use them anymore, use Ice spells
          instead.  If you don't have any or have run out of mps do the
          following:  Have Mog dance Wind Song, Cyan use SwdTech 1 or 4,
          Strago use Aqua Rake, Edgar use Chainsaw, Gau ????, Relm attack or
          Sketch, Sabin Pummel, Setzer use slot, and the rest attack.  When

                VANISH/DOOM: no
          Concentrate on the main thing.  If it launches a Speck, attack it
          (don't use spells). Just use your most powerful attack spells (Ice,
          Fire, and Bolt), your attack Espers (Maduin, Shiva, Ramuh, etc.),
          or if neither of those options are possible use your best attacks
          (Sabin's AuraBolt,  Edgar's Drill, etc.).

                VANISH/DOOM: yes
          This dude hits hard so have one person use Cure 2 all the time.
          Have Shadow throw shuriken and have Edgar use Drill, Sabin
          AuraBolt, Cyan use SwdTech 1 or 4, Gau ????, Setzer use Slot/GP
          Rain, Mog do the Earth Blues Dance, Relm Sketch, and the rest attack.
          Also use your most powerful attack spells and Espers.  Also it may
          be a good idea to use the Phantom Esper the first thing (this will
          make you harder to hit for a little while).

          AuraBolt, Edgar's Drill, Mog's Earth Blues dance, Shadow's
          Shuriken throwing, etc.).  It shoud be dead in no time.  Cure as
          needed of course.  Another method to use would be to drain it's
          mps using Rasp (it'll die when it's mps are gone).
   Nerapa              HP: 2800     MP: 280      Weakness: ice,lightning,pearl
                VANISH/DOOM: no
          He has a wall spell on him so attack spells will just bounce back.
          If you have a wall spell on one of your characters, cast the
          attack spells on them.  Use your most powerful Espers and attacks.
   Phunbaba            HP: 28000    MP: 10000    Weakness: poison
                VANISH/DOOM: yes
          Don't use lightning attacks (Bolt spells, Ramuh, etc.), it heals
          him.  Use Phantom Esper to make you invisible and Sraphim to cure
          if needed.  Have Celes use spells and have Sabin use the Suplex
          blitz.  He'll run away when his hps get low.

          Don't use Ice spells on the bottom left tentacle or fire spells
          on the bottom right one or bolt spells on the top left one. Have
          Edgar use Drill, Celes attack, and Sabin attack the bottom right one
          and then use Fire Dance when it's dead.  If you have attack Espers
          use them.  Also use spells that correspond to the weakness of a
          tentacle (example: use fire on the bottom left one).

                VANISH/DOOM: yes
          Use fire spells and the Esper Ifrit if you have it equipped.
          Have Celes Runic, Sabin Suplex, Setzer attack or Slot/GP Rain, and
          Edgar use Chainsaw or Drill.
   Storm Drgn          HP: 42000    MP: 1250     Weakness: lightning
                VANISH/DOOM: yes
          Use Ramuh and Bolt spells.  If a person doesn't have bolt spells
          have them use there best attacks.  If you went back and added
          Cyan to your party, have him do either SwdTech 1 or 4.  Also cure
          whenever needed.
   Allo Ver            HP: 8000     MP: 8000     Weakness: fire, pearl
                VANISH/DOOM: yes (X-Zone only)
          The only hard part about this creature is that he can use Doom,
          which instantly kills its target.  Just keep attacking or casting
          fire spells until it dies.
   SrBehemoth          1st one HP: 19000   MP: 1600    Weakness: fire, poison

                VANISH/DOOM: yes (for the 1st one, X-Zone only for 2nd one)
          Use fire spells plus have Edgar use Chainsaw, Setzer use Slot/GP
          Rain, Celes attack, Sabin attack, and Cyan use SwdTech 1 or 4.
          After defeating the 1st one, a second one will attack from behind.
          Defeat this one the same way, or you can use revivify to kill it
          instantly.
   Chadarnook       Woman HP: 56000    MP: 9400     Weakness: fire
                    Demon HP: 30000    MP: 7600     Weakness: fire,pearl

   Phunbaba:The Return HP: 26000    MP: 10000    Weakness: poison
                VANISH/DOOM: yes
          You can defeat it basically the same way as before.  Have Edgar
          use Drill, Sabin Suplex, Celes Runic, Cyan use SwdTech 1 or 4,
          Gau ????, Shadow throw Shuriken, and Setzer attack or Slot/GP Rain.
          After a while, it'll use BabaBreath to blow a couple of your
          characters away.  Terra will join you to finish it off.  (After
          Terra joins, Phunbaba's hps and mps reset). Have Terra attack.
   Doom Gaze           HP: 55555    MP: 38000    Weakness: fire, pearl
                VANISH/DOOM: yes (DON'T use X-Zone or you won't get Bahamut)
          Whenever you happen to run into it, just beat the hell out of it
          with your best attacks.  Use life spells and Fenix Down to bring
          back dead companions if you feel like it.  It'll run from you
          rather quickly but it can't regenerate itself between fights, so
          next time you fight it it'll have the same amount of hps as it
          did when it ran.  Eventually you'll kill it.  Killing it will
          get you the Esper Bahamut.
   Red Dragon          HP: 30000    MP: 1780     Weakness: ice, water
                VANISH/DOOM: yes
          Use Ice spells if you have them.  Have Terra attack, Edgar use

          use SwdTech 1 or 4, Gau ????, Setzer attack or Slot/GP Rain,
          Strago use the Aqua Rake lore, and Relm attack.
   Ice Dragon          HP: 24400    MP: 9000     Weakness: fire
                VANISH/DOOM: yes
          Use fire spells or if you don't have them use your best attacks.
   Tritoch             HP: 30000    MP: 50000    Weakness: fire
                VANISH/DOOM: yes
          Use fire spells or best attacks to thaw it out.
   Umaro               HP: 17200    MP: 6990     Weakness: fire, poison
                VANISH/DOOM: no
          Use fire spells or best attacks.  Don't use Tritoch, Shiva, or
          Ice spells because it'll heal him.
   White Dragon        HP: 18500    MP: 1200     Weakness: none
                VANISH/DOOM: yes
          Use Ultima and Flare if you have them.  Have Gogo Mimic or cast
          spells, and everyone else use their most powerful spells and Espers.
   MagiMaster          HP: 50000    MP: 50000    Weakness: varies
                VANISH/DOOM: no
          METHOD 1: Don't bother using elemental spells (fire,ice,bolt,etc)

                    because the MagiMaster constantly changes what spells heal
                    and hurt him. Using Beserk on him stops him from doing this
.
                    Instead use spells like Ultima and Flare, plus Espers like
                    Bahamut and Maduin. Also make ABSOLUTELY SURE AT LEAST ONE
                    CHARACTER HAS LIFE 3 ON THEM because when MagiMaster dies
                    he casts Ultima on your party and unless you have a helluva
                    lot of hps, your toast.
          METHOD 2: Cast Beserk on him and use the Phantom Esper on your party.
                    Now continually cast Rasp on him (or Osmose if your MPS
                    get really low).  When his 50000 mps are gone he'll try
                    to cast Ultima but since he has no mps he'll fail and die.
                    NOTE: It takes a long time to beat him this way but once
                        you cast Bserk on him and used Phantom on you, he
                        can't hurt you at all.
          METHOD 3: Equip everyone with Wall Rings and let MagiMaster
                    kill himself.  You still need Life3 or a lot of HPS
                    with this method.
          METHOD 4: Cast Bserk on him, then use the Phantom Esper on
                    your party as in METHOD 2.  Now keep scanning him
                    as you attack.  When his HPS reach a few thousand
                    use the Palidor Esper.  Hopefully, the first character
                    down will kil him.  He'll cast Ultima which'll kill
                    the one character, but the ones in the air will live.
   The 3 Stooges  Left/ Larry  HP: 10000   MP: 2000    Weakness: fire
                   Top/ Curley HP: 15000   MP: 2000    Weakness: ice, water
                 Right/ Moe    HP: 12000   MP: 2000    Weakness: none
                VANISH/DOOM: yes (all three of them)
           Use Ultima and Bahamut if you have them.  If not just use your
           best attacks and spells, taking note what spells heal which
           stooge.
   WrexSoul            HP: 23066    MP: 5066     Weakness: Ice
                VANISH/DOOM: no
           For a quick battle use X-Zone (it'll suck in the SoulSavers and
           you'll win the fight).  If you don't have X-Zone then don't worry
           about the SoulSavers.  You first have to attack one of your
           characters until they die. This will cause WrexSoul to appear in a
           form you can kill.  Once he has appeared bring your dead character
           back to life and then use Ultima, Bahamut, and Ice spells, or your
           best attacks.  If he disappears, repeat the process only kill a
           different character this time.
   Master Pug          HP: 22000    MP: 1200     Weakness: varies
                VANISH/DOOM: yes
           Use Ultima, Flare, and Bahamut.  Have Edgar use Drill or Chainsaw,
           Sabin use Bum Rush, Celes use Runic, Cyan use SwdTech 7, Gau
           ????, Setzer attack or Slot/GP Rain, and everyone else attack.
   Blue Dragon         HP: 26900    MP: 3800     Weakness: lightning
                VANISH/DOOM: yes
           Use your best spells (Ultima, Meteor, Flare, etc), your best
           Espers (Bahamut, etc.), and attacks (Sabin's Bum Rush, Edgar's
           Drill, etc.).  Don't cast Doom (without Vanish first, break,
           or Haste/Slow spells because it'll use Rippler to make
           the spells affect you instead.
   KatanaSoul          HP: 37620    MP: 7400     Weakness: poison
                VANISH/DOOM: yes
           Use Ultima for major damage.  Otherwise use your best attacks
           (Espers, spells, regular, and special).
   Hidon               HP: 25000    MP: 12500    Weakness: fire,pearl,earth
                VANISH/DOOM: yes (X-Zone only)
           The easiest way to kill Hidon is to bring it to life (i.e. use
           a life spell, revivify, etc.).  If you don't want to do that
           then use Pearl on Hidon if you have it.  Don't worry about the
           Hidonites.  Also use Ultima, Meteor, Flare, Bahamut, Terrato, etc.
           plus special attacks.
   Dirt Drgn           HP: 28500    MP: 16500    Weakness: wind, water
                VANISH/DOOM: yes
           If you have some sort of Gaia equipment on a lot of the dragon's
           spells will heal you.  Ultima works quite will.  Use it if you
           have it, if not use your other more powerful attacks.  Casting
           Float on your party will also be a big help.
   Atma                HP: 55000    MP: 19000    Weakness: none
                VANISH/DOOM: yes
           Ultima works quite well.  Use it along with the best attacks
           of the members of your party.  Another way to do it is to try
           depleting its MPS by using spells like rasp (it'll die when its
           MPS are drained completely).
   Gold Dragon         HP: 32400    MP: 4000     Weakness: water
                VANISH/DOOM: yes
           Don't use lightning based spells (Bolt, Ramuh, etc.).  DO use
           Ultima, Bahamut, Flare, Meteor, etc.  Using your best attacks
           should be safe as long as they don't involve lightning.
   Inferno & Company   Rough   HP: 8000    MP: 770    Weakness: ice
                       Inferno HP: 30800   MP: 9700   Weakness: lightning
                       Striker HP: 11000   MP: 2600   Weakness: fire
                VANISH/DOOM: no
           Striker is the claw on the right and Rough is the left one.
           Don't worry about the claws, concentrate on Inferno.  If you
           use Ultima, Meteor, Bahamut, or some other spell/Esper that
           attacks all enemies then you don't have to worry about anything.
           Use your best attacks.
   Skull Drgn          HP: 32800    MP: 1999    Weakness: fire, pearl
                VANISH/DOOM: yes
           Use fire spells and pearl as the basis of your attack.  Ultima,
           Flare, Bahamut, etc. work good too.  Cure 3 also works good.
   Doom                HP: 63000    MP: 4800    Weakness: pearl
                VANISH/DOOM: yes
           Use Ultima for major damage.  Also use your other major attacks.
           Once he uses his force field don't use spells that'll bounce
           off a wall (elementals, flare, etc.).
   Goddess             HP: 44000     MP: 19000    Weakness: none
                VANISH/DOOM: yes
           Use your more powerful spells (Ultima, Meteor, etc.) and attacks
           (Sabin's Bum Rush, etc.)
   Guardian again      HP: 60000    MP: 5200    Weakness: lightning, water
                VANISH/DOOM: no
           Use lightning spells along with your best attacks (spells or
           otherwise).  If you have Sabin have him do the Bum Rush blitz
           for some good damage.
   Poltrgeist          HP: 58000    MP: 18900   Weakness: poison
                VANISH/DOOM: no
           Again, use your best attacks (Ultima, Flare, Bum Rush, etc).
           Ice 3 seems to work pretty good, too.
   Final Fight Lvl 1   (approximate values for hps)
                Head   HP: 30000    MP: ????    Weakness: ????

            Right Hand HP: 32000    MP: ????    Weakness: ????
                VANISH/DOOM: no
           Here you have to destroy the creatures head and both hands.  Use
           your best attacks and it'll go down in no time.  The best way to
           do it is have 3 characters attack (Ultima works good) and the 4th
           one heal.
   Final Fight Lvl 2   (approximate values for hps)
                Left   HP: 40000    MP: ????    Weakness: ????

              BotRight HP: 30000    MP: ????    Weakness: ????
                VANISH/DOOM: no
           There are 4 things to attack here.  The same strategy as above
           should work.
   Final Fight Lvl 3   (approximate values for hps)
                Left   HP: 10000    MP: ????    Weakness: ????
                Right  HP: 40000    MP: ????    Weakness: ????
                VANISH/DOOM: no
           Only two things to attack here.  If you're using attacks that
           only hit a single target, concentrate them on the angel head
           (the one on the left) because it'll heal both targets.  When you
           get the right target down low it'll get mad and start using major
           damage attacks like Merton.  Have your Cure spells ready.
   Kefka: The End      HP: 62000 (approx.)  MP: ????    Weakness: ????
                VANISH/DOOM: no
           Be ready to cure when he uses Fallen One (which reduces all your
           characters to 1 hp).  Even regular/special attacks work pretty
           good on him (that's all I used and the fight went pretty quick).
           Make this fight go even quicker by using the Quick spell.
           Another tactic that makes the fight go quicker is to equip everyone
           with Flame Shlds and use Merton.

   Once you have the airship you can go anywhere on the map.  You can land
   anywhere except for mountains, forests, and deserts.  Inside the airship
   you can change you party members by talking to any of the characters on the
   ship.  Also on the ship you will find three non-playable characters: one
   will restore your hps and mps, one will sell you stuff (Item shop), and the
   third one will allow you to unequip some or all of your characters.  The
   restorer and the Item shop aren't on the second airship that you get in the
   World of Ruin.

   In the auction house in Jidoor you have the ability to bid on items.

   If you go to the Auction House in the World of Balance you can bid on the
   following items:
        Cherub Down which costs 10000 GP
        Talking Chocobo which you can't win
        Golem which'll cost 20000 GP
        Cure Ring costs 20000 GP
        ZoneSeek for 10000 GP.
   In the World of Ruin the items you can bid on are:
        1/1200 of an airship (which you can't win)
        the Hero Ring which will cost 50000 GP
        Golem for 20000 GP
        a Zephyr Cape for 10000 GP
        an Imp Robot (which you can't win)
        ZoneSeek which will cost you 10000 GP.

   The order the items appear seems to be random.  If you stay at the Inn
   I think the Auction House will auction off things you can actually buy.

   Any time you have Shadow in your party (in either the World of Balance or
   the World of Ruin) you can visit an Inn and possibly
   learn more about Shadow's past.  To do so all you have to do is sleep at
   an Inn (in any town) or any other place you can sleep (like the beds in
   Doma Castle) and the hope you get a dream sequence.  The odds of getting
   a dream sequence are like 1:4 for the first four sequences.  The fifth
   dream will be seen when you find Shadow in the World of Ruin.

   Relm's Sketch bug - this bug is now pretty famous (infamous?).  It involves
        Relm (or Gogo) sketching a monster and then the bug occurs.  It
        seems to happen most when sketching large enemies, unusual enemies,
        or invisible enemies (Gau, Intangir, etc.), but can occur when
        sketching normal monsters.
        The bug may do a number of different things, it may:
                1. Reset EVERYTHING (i.e. three empty save slots)
                2. Permanently mess up saved games
                3. Give your party tons (as many as 255 [it'll say 0]) of
                   different items.  Anything from Dirks to Economizers and
                   Gem Boxes.
                4. Just freeze up (meaning you'll have to reset)
                5. Erase items from your inventory.
        It may have been fixed in later versions of the game.
        About the only way to make sure you don't encounter this bug is
        to simply not sketch.

   Duncan bug - If you go to Duncan's house in the World of Ruin before
        getting Bum Rush and without Sabin, you'll find Duncan practicing
        in the house.  Press 'X' to go to the subscreen then 'B' to return.
        Each time you do this Duncan will restart his jump.  By doing this
        over and over you can make Duncan jump through the wall and into
        the black space around the room.

        When a character gets low on hps (they kneel down in battle) there
        is a possibility (1 in 20 chance) that they will do a special attack
        that does massive damage.  The attacks are done by using the FIGHT
        command while hps are low (and then only at random).  The attacks are:
CHARACTER:      NAME OF ATTACK:         DESCRIPTION OF ATTACK:
Terra           Riot Blade              Throws rings at enemies
Locke           Mirager                 Quickly dashes in for the kill
Edgar           Royal Shook             Flash of light
Sabin           Tiger Break             Drop kick
Celes           Spin Edge               Chainsaw-like attack with sword
Shadow          Shadow Fang             Hops on and slashes the enemy
Cyan            Back Blade              Screen goes black while he attacks
Setzer          Red Card                Throws 3 sets of cards in a row
Mog             Moogle Rush             Looks like Pummel
Strago          Sabre Soul              Flash of light as he jumps at enemy
Relm            Star Prism              Stars surround enemy
Gogo            X-Meteor                A giant meteor strikes enemy

NOTE: Gau and Umaro don't have a near death attack because they don't have
        a FIGHT command.

        uses.  Value is how much you'll get if you sell it. Runic is if
        Celes can use it with the Runic command.  2-hand is if it can be
        equipped with 2 hands (with the Gauntlet). SwdTech is if Cyan can

        -Equip both the Offering and the Genji Glove and your character will
         attack 8 times, 4 with each hand.  Each hit is weaker than a
         normal attack.
        
        -Similar to the above, you can equip the Offering and the ThiefGlove
         to Locke and then when he uses the CAPTURE command he'll attempt to
         steal 4 times.

        -You can have Locke steal from the creatures on the Solitary Island.
         Of course you have to do it before they self destruct.  The Peepers
         have Elixirs and the EarthGuards have Megalixirs

        -You can have Locke still from the Aquilas in the Phoenix cave
         and you may get an Economizer.

        -In the forest shaped like a dragon's head to the north of the Veldt
         you may run into Brachosaur.  They leave Economizers once
         in a while when you beat them. This forest is also a good spot to
         raise levels (especially with the experience egg).

        -Intangirs and Flans have Magicite that Locke can steal.

        -Equip Umaro with the Gauntlet relic to raise both his Bat.Pwr and
         his Defense.
        
        -Once Locke has the Thief Glove have him attempt to Capture from
         everything.  Lots of times he'll just steal stuff like Tonics and
         Potions, but other times he'll steal stuff like Elixirs, Magicites,
         and Relics.
        
        -Any undead monster can be killed instantly with a Revivify, a Fenix
         Down or a Life spell.
        
        -Cast DOOM on a party member wearing the Relic Ring to heal that
         member's HPS to their MAX.

        -You can defrost a frozen party member with a FIRE spell.

        -Having a different lead character when using a tent will change the
         tent's color and the banner or symbol on the center pole.
                Umaro & Mog           - White tent with star on top
                Setzer,Shadow, & Cyan - light blue tent with a cross (or
                                                         something) on top
                Celes,Sabin, & Edgar  - green tent with crown on top
                Terra                 - purple tent with bow on top
                Locke                 - orange tent with boomerang (or moon)
                                                        on top
                Gau,Gogo,Strago, & Relm - orange tent with star-like
                                                        thing on top

        -Cast Vanish on an enemy and then cast either X-Zone or Doom on that
         enemy for an instant defeat (this even works on some of the bosses).

        -Equip both the Ragnarok Esper and the Paladin Shld to learn Ultima
         twice as fast as normal (Ultima * 2).

        -Use relics that normally prevent a status ailment to cure them.
         (i.e. equip an Amulet which prevent poison to cure a poisoned
         party member).

        -Equip the Cure Ring to counteract the effects of the Thornlet.

        -Equip the Ribbon to counteract the effects of the Cursed Shld.
                (This is a must to uncurse it anyways.)
        
        -Equip Gau with the Merit Award to make the attacks of his rages
         stronger.

        -Back Row Attackers:
         The special attacks of Sabin, Cyan, Shadow, Celes, Mog, Banon,
         Strago, Edgar, Leo, Setzer, and MagiTek Armor all do the same
         damage from the back row as they do from the front.  Gau and
         Relm can sometimes get the same damage from the back, depending
         on what command they are trying to copy.

        -Multi Mimic:
         With Gogo in your party, have someone use and Esper, cast a spell,
         or use an item.  Now skip everyone and have Gogo Mimic over and
         over.  This will allow him (or her) to use the Esper over and
         over, use the spell without any MP cost, or use the item without
         losing any from your inventory.  This is especially useful with
         Ragnarok (by Mimicing over and over you can Ragnarok the entire
         enemy party).

        -Super Warrior Setzer 1:
         Equip Setzer with the Offering, a Black Belt, the Paladin Shld,
         and the Fixed Dice, plus the best helmet and body armor he can
         wear.  Now put him in the back row.

        -Super Warrior Setzer 2:
         Equip Setzer with the Offering, a Genji Glove, the Fixed Dice,
         and Doom Darts, plus a helmet and body armor.  Put in the back
         row.

        -Kappa the Imp:
         Equip the Imp Halberd, the TortoiseShld, Imp's Armor, and
         Titanium to a character.  Rename him/her Kappa.  Kappa the
         Imp is now a member of your party and it'll be a powerful
         addition.

        -8 Magic Attacks Per Round:
         Equip every one with Wall Rings and one person with the Gem Box.
         Now have the person with the Gem Box cast two spells at your
         party.  The spells will bounce off your party and hit the enemies.
         Two spells * Four characters = 8 magic attacks.

        -99 Levels in Only Days:
         Before getting on the raft at Lete River (in the Returner's
         Hideout) go to CONFIG and make sure your cursor is set up for
         MEMORY.  Once on the river go to the 1st save spot.  Save your
         game and then go on until you're offered a choice of either
         UP or LEFT.  Choose UP and follow the loop around, fighting as
         usual.  When fighting use the following attack sequence:
                Terra = fight     Edgar = AutoCrossbow
                Banon = health    Sabin = fight
         If you have a controller with autofire or rapid-fire, set it
         so the 'A' button is pressed over and over (you may need to use
         a rubberband or something to hold down the button.  Now leave
         the game alone for a long time (come back once in a while to
         make sure you didn't die or something).  After a couple days
         you'll be at level 99.
         NOTE:  I don't recommend leaving your SNES on for a couple
                days straight.  It probably isn't good for the machine
                or the game pak.

        -To gain MPS and Gold quickly, go to the desert near Maranda in
         the World of Ruin and fight the Cactrots and Hoovers.

        -To go through battles without much damage, equip your party
         members with Dragon Horns and/or Dragoo Boots.  You'll be in the
         air so much the monsters won't have a chance to hit you.

        These are things that I've heard about.  Can anyone confirm any
        of these.

        - Apparently the Paladin Ring DOES exist, but there is no confirmed
          way to find it and it was also taken out of versions released after
          November 31, 1994.  Square says that it does not exist.

        - It is rumored that there are more than the 5 dreams listed
          in the SHADOW'S DREAMS section.  I've heard there are as many
          as 7.  Square says there are only the 5 mentioned in this guide
          though.

  There are at least 2 versions of FF3.  Some of these codes won't work
  on some versions of the game.  There are a few alternates here that you
  may want to try if you can't get the 1st code listed to work.
  I have not tested all of these codes so some may not do what they
  say they'll do.

NOTE: With the experience code you can put it in and get Terra up to 99 at
      the beginning of the game and then save it.  After that you don't need to
      use that code any more because everyone will be lvl 99 when you get them
      (except Banon, I think he was only 96).  Also if you use this code both
      Terra and Celes will have all sorts of spells (Ultima, Pearl, Flare,
      Meteor, etc). You're practically invincible :)
NOTE: The codes that give Terra new commands do not work on saved games.  You
      have to use them on new games, but once you have them they CAN be saved.
      The SHOCK command is just what General Leo uses in Thamasa when he fights
      Kefka.  The SUMMON command is used to call on the equipped Esper and
      can be used as many times as you have mps for in one battle.  The POSSESS
      command is what the Ghosts in the Phantom Train have.  The HEALTH command
      is like what Banon has.  MAGITEK is like what you have when you're wearin
g
      MagiTek armor.  And the rest of the commands are like what your normal
      characters have.

                HPS     MPS     WEAKNESS(ES)    What you get if you steal
                EXP     GP                      What you get if you defeat it
                What Gau's rage does for it
                What you may get if you use Ragnarok on it
                What Relm's Sketch and Control command do
                LOCATION
        More will be added to a later version.
