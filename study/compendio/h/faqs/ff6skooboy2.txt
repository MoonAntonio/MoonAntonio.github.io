Condensed Rage Guide 3.8

By Skoobouy <skoobouy at hotmail dot com>

Compiled and useful
for Final Fantasy III for the Super the Super Nintendo
or Final Fantasy IV for the Sony Playstation.


*** Introduction

Gau is a skinny kid with a mullet who managed to spend his whole life eating
grass on an African flatland without so much as getting a tan or growing 
any stubble. But don't make him mad, because he will UWAAOOO all over you, and 
you don't want that to happen. Believe me, you just don't. Don't even ask me 
what it means. It's too horrible.

Anyway, his skill, Rage, is powerful but intimidatingly large, so I wrote this
guide to make it less intimidating. Since I am easily intimidatable, I relied
heavily - almost exclusively, on the ingenius work of less intimidatable 
GameFAQ writers. You know the Churchill quote about shoulders and giants, so I 
won't repeat it. This guide can be your one-stop reference to playing with Gau.

I. All the Best Rages with a Minimum of Fuss

Don't get every Rage. Seriously. Just don't do it. Take it from a guy who
spends his hours in worthless FAQ writing: it's a waste of your precious time.
Instead, heed my advice, pick a few good ones, Leap on them, and be on your
merry way. That's what this guide is for. I recommend you just print out this
first section and let it be your almost constant companion. But don't show it 
to your girlfriend. She just won't understand. 


A. WORLD OF BALANCE: From Narshe to the Phantom Forest

There's lots time before your first visit to the Veldt, but you should be
playing with some very basic information in mind. First: the fewer unecessary
battles you fight, the easier it will be for you to get the Rages you want
faster. Fight the monsters you want, and try to avoid groupings of monsters you 
don't want. Second: running away counts. To see a monster grouping on the 
Veldt, you only have to walk away alive and save your game; you don't have to
kill 'em. Third: when the game splits into three scenarios, CHOOSE SABIN'S 
SCENARIO LAST, to get Rages from the other two scenarios.

Now, let's look at the cream of the crop for the first part of the game:

     Great Rages           Awsome Rages       (Gau's Default Rages)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Areneid|Numb           Marshal|Wind Slash        Lobo|Tusk
    Rhodox|Snare         Pterodon|Fire Ball     Were-Rat|Poison
   Cirpius|Haste 2      Dark Side|Ice 2       M-TekArmor|Tek Laser
   Trilium|Bio          Stray Cat|Catscratch      Hornet|IronNeedle
Primordite|Numblade         Hazer|Bolt 2       Rhinotaur|Mega Volt
   Templar|Fire 2            Bomb|Blaze          Brawler|Stone
   Telstar|Sonic Boom   Over-Mind|Elf Fire       Exocite|Scissors
                                              Trilobiter|PoisonBarb
                                                 Whisper|Demi

Notes on Skills:
-You won't use Rhodox|Snare much for a long time, but get it anyway. There are
 few better ways to practice the lucrative profession of Intangir hunting.
-Fire Ball and Wind Slash are great ways to clear a field; remember that,
 although Fire Ball is stronger, Wind Slash doesn't divide damage when there
 are several targets. 
-Numb and Numblade are exactly the same. Primordite protects against Imp and is
 weak against Bolt instead of Water and Ice. No big deal. 
-Telstar and Hazer are the only Rages here with protection from instant Death;
 however, Telstar also protects from everything else besides Slow and Stop. 
-Blaze only looks like a blue Fire 1, but it's actually stronger than Fire 2.

Easily Missed Monsters:
-Dark Side will only appear if you DON'T follow the sparkly thing through the
 cave in Terra's scenario. Don't leave until you see Dark Side. Try to get
 both formations!
-Telstar is a Monster-in-a-Box in a tent to far lower left of your entry into
 the Imperial Base.
-Over-Mind is a somewhat rare monster found only inside the train cars of the
 Phantom Train.


B. WORLD OF BALANCE: From the Serpent Trench to the Magitek Research Facility

This is where the game REALLY begins. Marshal and Stray Cat are strong, but 
they will be piddly compared to the glory that awaits you. If you're willing to
walk a long way, you can teach Gau any Rage up to Zozo monsters BEFORE going to
the Magitek Research Facility. Before doing anything, you can get 
Anguiform|Aqua Rake and Aspik|Giga Volt, which together make the Research 
Facility a walk a field of daisies. Walk all the way south of Narshe, through 
Figaro Cave, over Mt. Kolts, through the Returner's Hideout and Lete River, 
over to Nikeah to buy a chocobo, all the way down the eastern continent, to the
Veldt. Once you have your Rages, hop into the Serpent Trench back to Nikeah, 
sail to South Figaro, and go back through Figaro Cave to resume your quest.

Which monsters to keep an eye out for? Just a few gems...

     Great Rages           Awsome Rages            "Upgrades"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hadesgigas|Magnitude8   Anguiform|Aqua Rake   SlamDancer|Ice 2
    Wyvern|Cyclonic         Aspik|Giga Volt
    Rhinox|Life 3      ChickenLip|Quake
                          General|Cure 2

Notes on Skills:
-None of these monsters are hard to meet.
-Lots of strong multi-enemy attack spells here; Magnitude8 is great, and Aqua
 Rake can take care of fliers
-For some real shenanigans, have a character learn "Float" from Stray (obtained
 in Zozo), Float your characters, and commence Quaking whenever you can. As
 soon as you can, buy Gaia Gears from Thamasa, get Cyan and Edgar out of your
 party (they can't wear Gaia Gear without a Merit Award), and you will heal
 yourself with Gau's Quakes. You'll be the most violent Quaker there ever was.
-SlamDancer|Ice 2  has the simple advantage over Dark Side|Ice 2 of not being
 undead (or having innate Seizure).


C. WORLD OF BALANCE: From the Sealed Gate to the Floating Continent

This section is relatively uninteresting. And therefore short. Yeah. Here are
the good ones:

     Great Rages           Awsome Rages            "Upgrades"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Zombone|Condemned        Ninja|Water Edge     Chimera|Aqua Rake
       Ing|Lifeshaver    Intangir|Pep Up        Gigantos|Magnitude8
  Behemoth|Meteor

Notes on Skills:
-Zombone|Condemned and Intangir|Pep Up are the fastest ways to teach Strago
 their Lores.
-Aqua Rake takes a back seat to Water Edge for flying monsters from here on;
 but you might still consider Chimera|Aqua Rake for its superior protection
 from status ailments and instant Death.
-Gigantos, unlike his "little" brother Hadesgigas, has Protect.
-If you Mute Gau before Raging Intangir, you have a Hasted, Safe, Shelled,
 Clear, Floated, 'Ribboned', element-absorbing behemoth of a character (but not
 protected from Slow or Stop).


D. WORLD OF RUIN: From the Solitary Island to the Daryl's Tomb

With small variations, the first half of the World of Ruin is basically linear.
You'll likely come across all of these beasties without even thinking about it,
although to be safe, make sure you don't leave the Solitary Island without
watching an Earthguard starve to death.

     Great Rages           Awsome Rages            "Upgrades"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Earthguard|Big Guard      Peepers|Pearl Wind  
  Buffalax|Slow 2      Gilomantis|Shrapnel
 Mad Oscar|Sour Mouth     Harpiai|Aero
      Orog|Pearl       PowerDemon|Flare
                        Osteosaur|X-Zone
                         Mesosaur|Step Mine

Notes on Skills:

-Mesosaur|Step Mine ought to be a favorite weapon, since it has all of the
 benefits and none of the drawbacks of Stago's Lore of the same name. To get
 the damage up to 9999, you have to walk 319,968 steps, and there's no worry
 about MP. Here's an easy way to do it: at any time when it's convenient, go to
 Jidoor and walk into it from the left. Continue walking, and you will exit the
 city, and then immediately re-enter. Now tape the D-pad down, and with Sprint
 Shoes, your mad little pilgrimage will be over in about 15 hours. (Thanks to
 Xuxon in the GameFAQs forums for this tip).


E. WORLD OF RUIN: Miscellanious Quests

The World of Ruin after getting the Airship is your leisurely smorgasbord of 
positively awsome Rages. Go ahead, be a glutton, go after the best Rages first.
If you're too weak to beat a monster, run away! It will still appear on the 
Veldt. Use this for toughies like Tyranosaur if they tenderize you into 
hero-burger.

     Great Rages           Awsome Rages            "Upgrades"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Punisher|Bolt 3      Nightshade|Charm          Vectaur|Pearl Wind
SrBehemoth|Fire 3       Magic Urn|Cure 3      Evil Oscar|Bio
    Woolly|Ice 3       Tyranosaur|Meteo  
  Luridian|Land Slide       Mover|Merton 
                         Retainer|Shock    
                          Veteran|Roulette 

Notes on Skills:
-Veteran|Roulette and Nightshade|Charm are two very broken skills; the former
 is an unblockable death spell; the latter is a permanent, universal "Muddle"
 that can be cast on one monster at a time. Sick, is all I have to say.
-Replace your dilapidated Trilium Rage with Evil Oscar--same delicious Bio
 skill, exciting new element-absorbing package! (except fire).
-Use Vectaur instead of Peepers for Pearl Wind, because Seizure = bad.
-Which of Gau's offensive Rages is best? Depends on the context. 
  1. If you need to and can, exploit enemy elemental weaknesses with Bolt 3,
     Ice 3, Quake, Pearl, or Bio.
  2. Failing that, do a Merton+Flame Shlds combo (esp. if the critter has a
     weakness to fire/wind). Buy Falchions in Jidoor and bet them at the
     Colliseum for Flame Shlds to equip your whole party.
  3. If Merton's fire and wind elements work against you, resort to Meteo or
     Shock for multiple enemies, or Land Slide for one as it is less likely to
     miss.
  4. Or just use Meteo constantly, 'cuz it's METEO AND TI ROX0R5!1!! (Glee!) :3

D. WORLD OF RUIN: From the Solitary Island to the Daryl's Tomb

Note: The World of Ruin is linear until you get the new airship after Daryl's
Tomb. Following the advice of NPCs will carry you to Maranda and Mt. Zozo;
after that, the obvious choice is to plunder the Veldt Cave. However, with the
world being your Rage oyster, I'll be conservative and guess that you picked up
Gau right after the Tomb. If you do nothing else after that, here are the new
monsters you will see.

E. WORLD OF RUIN: Miscellanious Quests

Well, from this point on, kindly disregard all semblance of order. There is
no "before" and no "after" - lies, lies and chicanery, all of it! Whatever
punishment your party can withstand--that quest is yours to complete, within
limits (e.g., you have to get through Ruined Narshe before you go through
Umaro's Cave).

The game does make suggestions, though. Messenger Pigeons inspire Celes to
tell you to go to Maranda, where another pigeon directs you to Zozo, where Cyan
mentions Gau and the Veldt, etc. That is that order listed here. If you follow
it, you won't have the best Rages--like Tyranosaur|Meteo--until the end of the
game. Not good! So anyway, here it is.

CHAPTER III: Chart of Rages by Skill

A. Damage-Dealing Special Skills

These Rages are nothing more than attacks with different strengths and their
own names. They aren't very exciting, but look out for Catscratch. The Level
numbers operate in the following way:

Damage = (Normal 'Fight' Damage) + 
([Normal 'Fight' Damage] x [Special's Level / 2])


Skill       Level  Power   Monster
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bite        1      1.5x    Vector Pup, Doberman, Bounty Man
Catscratch  6      4x      Stray Cat
Clamp       1      1.5x    Actaneon
Critical    1      1.5x    Guard
Gouge       3      2.5x    Gold Bear
Husk        1      1.5x    Cephaler
Incisor     1      1.5x    Leafer
IronNeedle  1      1.5x    Hornet
Knife*      14     8x      Pugs
Oogyboog    2      2x      Bogy

Tackle      1      1.5x    Ralph
Tail        1      1.5x    Sand Ray
Tusk        1      1.5x    Lobo

* - Cannot be normally obtained.


B. Status-Causing Special Skills

These Rages look like attacks, but cause no physical damage. Instead, they
inflict a status effect. They are much more reliable than their magical
counterparts.

Skill        Effect   Monster
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bane Touch   Poison   Over Grunk
Cling        Slow     Poplium
Duster       Poison   Beakor
Face Bite    Blind    Lunaris
Heart Burn   Seizure  Crawly
Ink          Blind    Nautiloid
Numb         Stop     Areneid
Numblade     Stop     Primordite
PoisonBarb   Poison   Trilobiter
SleepSting   Sleep    Mind Candy
Wing Whisp   Bserk    Insecare


C. Magic Skills

These Rages take the form of traditional Magic, Lore, or various enemy skills
which only Gau can use. For easy comparison and selection, they are organized
as follows:

Attack Spells         Status Spells         Healing Spells
  Single Target         Enemy Targets         Single Target
  One or All Targets    Ally Targets          Multiple Targets
  All Targets


KEY:

Pwr - Power; Non-damage-dealing spells and spells whose "Pwr" does not reflect
      their actual strength are n/a.
Hit - Hit Rate; unblockable skills are n/a.
El -  Element of attack, as follows:
      f - Fire            p - Poison          e - Earth
      i - Ice             a - Air/Wind        w - Water
      b - Bolt/Lightning  h - Holy/Pearl      - - Non-elemental or n/a

I -   Ignores Defense; sometimes means that a skill is very powerful, but
      sometimes refers to healing or to a special mode of damage
      calculation. Non-damage-dealing spells are n/a ("/").
U -   Unblockable; these skills won't miss except in cases of enemy immunity.
      Untargetted spells are n/a ("/").
N -   No Split Damage; these spells do not become less effective when cast on
      multiple enemies at once. Single target and non-damage-dealing spells are
      n/a ("/").

APPENDIX: On Tempest

As noted in Master Zed's Attack Guide, Cyan's Tempest sword has one really
cool effect: when combined with Rage skills, it makes them unblockable, and
distributes them to all enemies. Catscratch, NumbBlade, and other skills
suddenly become WAY more powerful than they were ever intended. Obviously,
Cyan cannot use Rage. Solution? Merit Award! Unfortunately, Square blocked Gau
from equipping the Merit Award in the PlayStation versions of Final Fantasy
VI. Solution? Gogo! Yes, our favorite Mime can be a Doma-Retainer-Sword-
Wielding-Wild-Boy-of-the-Veldt in a matter of seconds.

If you ask me, this is cheating. It's no different than Psycho-Cyan, Vanish-
Doom, Relm-Sketching for Ragnaroks and $$$, or other things. Don't get me
wrong; I have no morals against cheating. But I don't think this tactic will
get you far in the Low-Level-Game or Natural-Magic-Game circles.

CONCLUSION

If you liked this guide, write me at (skoobouy at hotmail dot com) and let me
know--I won't feel like such a yutz for wasting so much time. My thanks
again for the hard work of so many FF fans. Bye!
