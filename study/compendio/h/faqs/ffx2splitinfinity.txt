If you need to find something quickly, press and hold CTRL (Control), then
press F button. This will bring up 'Find and Replace' box. In it type the

much faster than scrolling thru entire guide.

For your convenience I've inserted special search codes near every section to
help you easily hop on to that section by using search code provided. Each
search code will appear only twice in whole guide - thus getting stray hits
will be impossible.

- Final Version (10th December 2005)
# Added Bribe and CONGRATS! formulae sent in by DiabolicAngel.
# Added Nab Gil and Mug note about always awarding AP.
# Added a note from Terence about GG - as it turned out, some of them are more
  useful than I thought (for example, Ray of Hope raises your LUCK by 30 when
  equipped, correct? Well, pass thru all four nodes and gal's LUCK will rise
  by additional 120! Not 30, like I originally thought. Very good information!
  This info has been fixed and added for 13 GG.
# Changed e-mail address.
# Added one more site.

This may be final version, but that doesn't mean I'll stop updating it. I

04.)                         INTRODUCTION - G0400
=============================================================================
Y=========O===================T=========W=========H=========I=========A======

Hello! I am Damir Kolar and I welcome you to my new project. Once again I
have decided to write for a Final Fantasy game - more specifically a guide to
Final Fantasy X-2, a sequel to highly successful Final Fantasy X.

The day was 11th September 2003. It was then when I created this guide - on
that day first lines of the guide have been added and walkthrough started.
What you're looking at today is the result of that work. Now, allow me to
address some things:

- If you take a quick scan thru my guide, you won't find 100% completion
  checkpoints anywhere. I was thinking about including it, but in the end
  decided against it. Why bother with % checkpoints anyway? If you have
  downloaded this guide and are following it by the letter, then I guarantee
  you'll get 100% in the end in *single* playthrough, provided you follow the
  selections I make.

- If, on the other hand, you've downloaded my guide, but are disappointed not
  to see % checks, then crossreference my guide with other guides, that do
  include this feature. You now have twice the insurance that 100% will be
  yours in the end.

- Spoiler issue. I'm a player of the game, just like you (who is reading this
  guide) are. First time I've played through the game was completely by
  myself - I haven't been using any guides, therefore nothing was spoiled for
  me. All the story elements that were supposed to surprise me had such
  effect. And I will NOT spoil such story elements for you.

- With that in mind, this is the way this guide is written. To include as
  little spoilers as possible. Let me ask you this: Say you meet character X
  very early in the game and he proves to be a friend. Now, you're close to
  the end of the game and you open a guide to find some help you need. You
  accidentally 'trip' over final boss entry where it clearly says - BOSS
  battle: Character X. Now if this doesn't cause you to go ballistic, I don't
  know what will. I know the feeling cos I've had the displeasure of running
  into few such accidents.

- Have a problem with that or how I 'mask' spoilers? My guide is not the only
  one out there, you know. I'm not forcing you to use mine, but if you use
  others, then you better be prepared for lots of potential spoilers, which
  will ruin the element of surprise for you. Also, people that have problems
  with how I write my guide are in great minority.

- Usage of abbreviations. When you're in my place writing a guide for the
  game of such proportions, then complain about using too many abbreviations.
  You have no idea how immensely helpful abbreviations are for me when
  writing a guide. Besides, you will only need to look it up once or twice
  (maybe thrice) before it becomes second nature.

- Finding information. Aside mentioning CTRL+F feature, this guide is chipped
  up in major sections, making it very easy for you to find what you're
  looking for. You looking for specific accessory? Look into Accessories
  section, where all of them are listed alphabetically per category. CTRL+F,
  punching in the code and you're there. Same with just about anything.

- NTSC-J, NTSC or PAL coverage. I own all three versions of the game, and I
  also own FFX-2 International + Last Mission, thus ensuring this guide covers
  all four versions.

Are you ready? Power up your PS2, open the disc tray, pop in FFX-2 DVD, close
the disc tray, wait for starting credits (or press Start to skip), then select
New Game. The journey continues...

06.)                        MEET THE GIRLS! - G0600
=============================================================================
I=========G=============================R=========R==========================
Main issues addressed in this section are:
=============================================================================
Yuna's background information ----------------------------------------- G0601
Rikku's background information ---------------------------------------- G0602
Paine's background information ---------------------------------------- G0603
=============================================================================

Yello. In this short section I'll list down some of background information
regarding three gals whose actions and decisions you'll be in total control
of. Without too much blah blah let's begin!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
YUNA - G0601   | AGE: 19  | JOINS: Halfway thru storyline mission 1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BACKGROUND     | Daughter of high summoner Braska, the second-to-last
summoner who was able to defeat Sin 12 years ago. Like her father, she has
made an amazing deed of defeating Sin 2 years ago, only this time Sin is gone
for good. With the disappearance of Sin summoners no longer needed to be
sacrificed in order for people of Spira to live in peace - therefore aeons
(or fayth) were no longer needed as well. Following Sin's defeat Yuna now
throws away summoner job - she has chosen more advanced form of artillery...
dual guns! She joins forces with Rikku and Paine to form YRP, a group of
sphere hunters. Of course, they're not the only group of sphere hunters on
the face of Spira.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
RIKKU - G0602  | AGE: 17  | JOINS: She's present from the beginning
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BACKGROUND     | Daughter of Cid (leader of the Al Bhed people from Final
Fantasy X) and Yuna's relative. Her cheerful and happy attitude is sure to
keep you entertained for the whole game. Youngest gal of the bunch, but by no
means the weakest, her weapons of choice are dual knives. And dual knives are
usually weapons of thieves... yep, you guessed it, our sweet Rikku is a thief
(like that's something new, hehe). She's the second member of YRP group.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
PAINE - G0603  | AGE: 18  | JOINS: She's present from the beginning
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BACKGROUND     | Unlike Yuna and Rikku, Paine is a new character. I won't
reveal too much information about her background, because it is heavily tied
to the story of FFX-2, so you'll need to find out for yourself. She forms
third and final chain of YRP group.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I'll get you started by explaining what are the controls you'll be using when
playing the game. There are four distinctive control modes you'll have to get
used to. These are battle screen controls (inside random or boss battle),
field screen controls (when walking about), main menu screen controls (when
inside many menus, accessible with triangle button) and shop controls. May be
hard for a start, but you'll get a grasp of it in ten minutes.

way of buying items in lots of quantities.

performs soft reset and returns you to start up menu. Soft reset is disabled
during certain sequences and during battle animations.

------------------ A - GENERAL INFO ABOUT MAIN MENU - G0801 -----------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

1. Access the menu by pressing Triangle button anytime when on Field screen.

2. In top row help line is displayed, showing information on what does
   selected part of Triangle menu do (there's eight headings total).

3. Covering most of central right part girls' data is displayed, containing
   info on girl's name, current level, current / MAX HP, current / MAX MP,
   dressphere girl is equipped with and any possible negative statuses that
   linger after battle (such as poison or KO).

4. Covering left third of the screen are eight menu headings. These are
   explained in deeper depths a bit below.

5. On rock bottom you'll find time you've played FFX-2 so far, amount of Gil
   and your current location (also shown on globe of Spira).


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
------------------ B - MAIN MENU - ITEMS HEADING - G0802 --------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

You'll spend quite a bit of time with one of your best friends, the items.
What follows is explanation of this menu...

1. The top of the screen is reserved for help line that tells you what a
   selected item does when used or what are its effects in battle.

2. Below help line is a line with three commands:
   USE:       Let's you use items in your inventory. Note that only a
              fraction of items is usable, ie those that restore HP and MP
              and negative status changes - items that cannot be used are
              greyed out. To use say Potion, place the cursor on it and press
              X. A small window with pics of three gals, for each showing
              current/max HP and MP. Select gal you want to use Potion on and
              press Circle to complete the healing. Reapply as necessary, and
              press Circle to exit this submenu.
   SORT:      Let's you sort out items in your inventory, either Auto or
              Manual. By selecting Auto items will be arranged automatically,
              and by selecting Manual you're in the control. Place the cursor
              on the item you wish to put somewhere else and press X.
              Blinking cursor will appear near first selected item. What you
              do now is position another cursor at the second item. When X is
              pressed again, these two items will switch places.
              Note: The order in which items are arranged also affects order
              of items when accessed in battles.
   KEY ITEMS: Here all you can do is view key items you've acquired so far.

3. Lastly, most of the rest of the screen is reserved for items you currently
   possess; first a name of the item, followed by the amount of that
   particular item. You can hold a maximum of 99 units of one type of item.


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
---------------- C - MAIN MENU - WHITE MAGIC HEADING - G0803 ----------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This will also be one of your most used menus. Use this menu to heal, revive
or otherwise aid your girls when your MP is shooting thru the roof or you
lack the appropriate items.

1. First step in understanding white magic menu is to select a girl you wish
   to employ for healing. Note that once you obtain white mage DSP, all three
   girls gain access to Cure. However, you must equip white mage DSP on the
   girls in order to have them learn additional white magics. One more
   precaution is to be noted here: if say Yuna learns Curaga, only Yuna will
   be able to use Curaga in white magic menu! Curaga will not be accessible
   to Rikku or Paine, simply cos they need to learn it first.

2. When you select the gal you wish to toy with, take a look at the top of
   the screen - there a help line that tells you what a selected white magic
   does when used (Cure, Cura, Curaga etc.) or what are its effects in battle
   (Protect, Shell, Reflect etc.) resides.

3. Below help line a pic of selected gal with her basic info is displayed.

4. And finally, the big list of all white magics selected girl has learned so
   far by training faithfully in white mage DSP. Read point 1 of this heading
   to learn how to increase amount of white magics available. Only magics
   that are displayed in white can be used - those greyed out cannot be used
   outside battle.

5. Once you've decided on which white magic you want to use, place the cursor
   on it and press X. A small window with pics of three gals, for each
   showing current/max HP and MP. Select gal you want to use white magic on
   and press X to complete the healing. Reapply as necessary, and press
   Circle to exit this submenu.

6. You may switch between girls by pressing L1/R1.

7. You won't be able to use White Magic with a certain girl if she doesn't
   have enough MP, is petrified, KO-ed or silenced. Cure relevant status
   first, then you will be able to cast magic in this menu.

8. It isn't necessary to have a girl equipped with white mage DSP in order to
   use white magic.


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
------------------- D - MAIN MENU - EQUIP HEADING - G0804 -------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Another of most used menus, if not *the* most. Use this menu to properly
equip the girls with GG, DSP and two acc. At the same time you will be able
to view any and all changes done to girl's statistics, main command window (a
battle term explained below) and auto-abilities girl will gain.

1. First step in mastering equipment menu is to select a girl for equipping.

2. You're sure used to it now, aren't you? Help line at the top, I mean.

3. In top right corner you will always see basic info on selected girl (basic
   info containing name, current level, current / MAX HP, current / MAX MP,
   DSP girl is equipped with and any possible negative statuses that linger
   after battle (such as poison or KO).

4. Below selected girl's basic info you'll find her stats, MCW commands and
   AAB that girl has been bestowed with as a result of already equipped acc.

5. Garment Grid (or Result Plate) entry is displayed below help line. It
   tells you what GG selected girl is currently using. Only one GG can be
   equipped at a time! If you wish to change GG being used, press X when
   cursor is hovering over GG entry.

6. You'll be taken to GG submenu. In bottom left corner a list of all GGs you
   obtained so far will be displayed. Move thru the list with up/down, or
   press L2/R2 to scroll thru the list. When desired GG is chosen, press X to
   equip that particular GG. Note that you can only choose GG into which you
   have inserted at least one DSP. GG without inserted DSP will be greyed out
   and cannot be equipped (read Garment Grid heading below for more info on
   how you insert DSP!).

7. While you're choosing GG, pay attention to the right of the screen - an
   overview of currently pointed-at-GG is displayed, along with information
   on that GG displayed below. For more info on GG read Garment Grid heading
   below. Finally, when GG is equipped, you'll be prompted to select one of
   DSP inserted into lastly selected GG. Press X and equipping GG is done.

8. Dressphere entry is used to change jobs for the girl. If you wish to
   change job being used, press X when cursor is hovering over DSP entry.
   You'll be taken to an overview of GG currently equipped - it will also
   display all DSP inserted into that GG. Move the cursor about and press X
   to change the job or Circle to cancel.

9. Pay attention to girl's stats and MCW. Many of the jobs drastically change
   stats and may add new commands to girl's MCW - of course, it may also
   delete or replace them, so be careful. In case of stats, this is what you
   need to look out for:
   - stats that will increase after job change are displayed in blue
   - stats that will decrease after job change are displayed in red

10. Accessory entry is used to change accessories equipped on the girl. If
    you wish to change acc being used, press X when cursor is hovering over
    acc entry.

11. You'll be taken to a list of all acc you have acquired so far - this list
    is located in bottom left corner. Move thru the list with up/down, or
    press L2/R2 to scroll thru the list. When desired acc is chosen, press X
    to equip that particular acc. Note that you can only equip up to two acc!
    You will notice sometimes greyed out acc at the bottom of the list -
    nothing worrying about that, because those are acc equipped by other two
    girls.

12. Pay attention to girl's stats, MCW and AAB. Many acc drastically change
    stats and may add new commands to girl's MCW. In addition, some acc also
    possess innate AAB, which will take effect as soon as relevant acc is
    equipped. To repeat the teaching on stat changes:
    - stats that will increase after acc is equipped are displayed in blue
    - stats that will decrease after acc is equipped are displayed in red
    Note that bottom choice in acc list removes the acc equipped.

13. Then we have 10 statistics girls can have fun with. These are:
    HP   - Stands for Hit Points. Shown are two numbers: first is current HP,
           second is MAX HP. If first number is depleted to 0, girl is KO-ed
           and can no longer participate in battle unless revived. Higher HP
           means that girls can last longer in battle.
    MP   - Stands for Magic Points. Shown are two numbers: first is current
           MP, second is MAX MP. If first number is depleted to 0, girl
           cannot use any type of abilities that consume MP. More MP means
           more showtime in battle.
    STR  - Stands for Strength. It affects amount of physical damage girl can
           deal to enemies. Higher STR is, more damage girl does.
    DEF  - Stands for Defense. It affects girl's resistance to any type of
           physical attacks. Please note that there are PATK that ignore DEF
           stat. Higher DEF is, less damage girl receives from PATK.
    MAG  - Stands for Magic Power. It affects amount of magical damage girl
           can do to enemies, as well as potency of healing-type abilities.
           Higher MAG is, more magic damage girl does.
    MDEF - Stands for Magic Defense. It affects girl's resistance to any type
           of magical attacks. Please note that there are MATK that ignore
           MDEF stat. Higher MDEF is, less damage girl receives from MATK.
    AGL  - Stands for Agility. It affects girl's ATB filling rate and length
           of ATB bar. Higher AGL is, shorter ATB bar is and it fills faster.
    ACCU - Stands for Accuracy. It affects girl's ability to successfully
           strike foes with any type of physical attacks. Higher ACCU is,
           more successful girl is when hitting enemies.
    EVA  - Stands for Evasion. It affects girl's probability of evading any
           type of physical attacks launched by foes. Higher EVA is, more
           skilled girl is at dodging. Please note that there are PATK which
           cannot be evaded at all.
    LUCK - Stands for Luck. It affects: girl's probability of successfully
           striking the enemy, girl's probability of successfully dodging
           PATK launched by enemies and girl's probability of landing
           critical hits.
           LUCK affects only these three aspects and *nothing else*. Battle
           spoils, items stolen during battle and/or anything else is not
           affected by gameplay luck.

14. HP can go as high as 99999.
    MP can go as high as 999.
    For the eight remaining stats max value is 255.

15. In lower left corner another piece of important info is hiding - it shows
    girl's current EXP and how many EXP is needed before girl reaches next
    level.

14. You may switch between girls by pressing L1/R1.


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
------ E - MAIN MENU - GARMENT GRIDS (or Result Plate) HEADING - G0805 ------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Pressing X on this menu will immediately launch you into GG submenu. Use it
to view GG you've obtained so far, learn important information on GG's
effects when equipped, to insert DSP into GG or to just have fun.

1. The helpful help line on the top is always there.

2. On the left a list of all GG you obtained so far is displayed. Move thru
   the list with up/down, or press L2/R2 to scroll thru the list. Note how
   there are varying amount of empty slots and strange symbols on every GG
   you view? Empty slots are called NODES, whereas strange symbols are
   referred to as GATES.

3. You use nodes to insert DSP into them. Gates grant special properties to
   the girl when girl passes thru the gate as a result of dresschange (I'll
   discuss special properties stuff in Battle System entry of the guide).
   Once you select GG you wish to rearrange, press X and DSP list will
   appear, containing all DSP you've found so far (if GG in question is
   already being equipped on one of the girls, you'll get a warning asking
   you if you really wish to continue - select yes to proceed or no to
   cancel).

4. Move thru DSP list with up/down, or press L2/R2 to scroll thru the list.
   Press X at desired DSP you wish to insert into GG - now cursor jumps at
   one of the available nodes. Set DSP with X, cancel selection with Circle,
   or remove already inserted DSP with Triangle.

5. At the bottom of DSP list three commands are awaiting (ALPHA1001):
   AUTO       - will automatically fill up GG with appropriate combination of
                available DSP
   REARRANGE  - allows you to manually switch DSP's places on GG: place the
                cursor on DSP you wish to put somewhere else and press X;
                blinking cursor will appear near first selected DSP - what
                you do now is position another cursor at the second DSP; when
                X is  pressed again, these two DSP will switch places
   REMOVE ALL - automatically removes all DSP inserted into GG
   Once you're done inserting DSP, press Circle to leave this submenu. Now
   continue inserting DSP into other GG or press Circle again to return to
   main menu.

6. Right half of the screen shows how does GG look like. Below information
   about GG is displayed - this info tells you what are the effects of GG
   when it is equipped and what benefits do girls gain if during Dress Up
   they pass thru one of the gates. More detailed info on this aspect will be
   listed in Battle System entry of this guide.


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
----------- F - MAIN MENU - ABILITIES HEADING - G0806 - ALPHA1003 -----------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Use this menu to check up on abilities girls are learning. Each DSP has a
unique set of abilities that can be learned. Although abilities follow a set
learning pattern, it is not always the best one, therefore it is in your best
interest that you check this menu often and set abilities to be learned.

1. First step in mastering abilities menu is to select a girl, whose
   abilities you wish to tamper with.

2. Help line at the top, anyone?

3. In top right corner you will always see basic info on selected girl (basic
   info containing name, current level, current / MAX HP, current / MAX MP,
   dressphere girl is equipped with and any possible negative statuses that
   linger after battle (such as poison or KO).

4. Below selected girl's basic info you'll find her stats, MCW commands and
   AAB that girl has been bestowed with as a result of already equipped acc.
   This part of information is gone while you're selecting abilities to be
   learned.

5. DSP list is displayed below help line. It displays all DSP you've obtained
   so far - at the bottom of this list you may find DSP with unique icon,
   which is unique to the girl in question. This is a SDSP - each of the
   girls has one. For example, Yuna's SDSP is called Floral Fallal, while
   Rikku's is Machina Maw. Abilities on SDSP are also unique to the girl in
   question.

6. Now that we've established a connection, let's explain what do % numbers
   next to DSP mean. For example, let's choose Yuna. Her gunner DSP has 5%,
   whilst warrior DSP has 50%. What does that tell you? In short, it tells
   you percentage of mastery for that particular DSP. In example above, we
   see that Yuna has mastered only 5% of gunner DSP (meaning she learned few
   abilities), whereas she has 50% mastery over warrior (meaning she learned
   a lot of abilities).

7. Once all abilities for certain DSP are learned, a 'MASTER' sign will
   appear to the right of DSP's name, meaning that say Yuna has mastered that
   particular DSP.

8. Let's learn how to set abilities for learning, shall we? First select DSP
   you wish to toy with - you'll be taken to a list of abilities for that
   DSP. As a rule of thumb, some abilities are already learned when you
   obtain new DSP. Let's use an example - Yuna's songstress DSP will have
   Darkness Dance ability already learned. You will see that Sleepy Shuffle
   ability is being learned next. But let's say we don't like Sleepy Shuffle
   to be learned next, we would like Battle Cry. So what do you do?

9. Simply move the cursor using directionals or left stick and place it on
   Support Song, then press X to finish the preparation. From now on, any AP
   gained in battle will go into learning Battle Cry.

10. Be advised of the following: if Yuna is in battle as songstress, she will
    be learning abilities specific to songstress DSP only! If you wish to
    learn say one of samurai's abilities, Yuna must transform into samurai.

11. AP gained, you ask? See some numbers next to the abilities names? Let's
    use an example again, shall we?
    Example: Battle Cry - 0 / 10
    As you see, name of the ability is followed by two numbers. Second number
    denotes amount of AP needed before ability is learned. First number
    denotes amount of AP gained so far - once the AP requirement is met,
    ability is learned and can be used in battle.

12. How are AP obtained? In a variety of ways... by using skills a specific
    DSP offers (Attack command doesn't count), using an item, killing an
    enemy, or using some unique skills offered by acc/GG.
    Oddly enough, there are some exceptions to the rule:
    - using Machina Maw's Attack command nets 1 AP when used
    - Floral's Great Whirl nets 3 AP for using it
    - using Machina Maw's Shockwave command nets 2 AP when used
    - Machina Maw's Shockstorm command awards 2 AP when used
    - Machina Maw's Vajra attack awards 3 AP when used
    - Nab Gil / Mug commands ALWAYS award 1 AP when used, even if unsuccessful
    - Floral Fallal's Flare Whirl awards 2 AP when used

13. NO AP is awarded if one of following events happens:
    - special effect did not work (say you were trying to poison a fiend)
    - HP and/or MP were healed, but bar was already full
    - stealing attempt failed
    - attack used didn't cause any damage
    - chr's status wasn't cured
    - you use Attack command (sole exception mentioned above)

14. How come some abilities aren't displayed? There are two reasons for that.
    - You must learn some prerequisite abilities first. For example, Yuna's
      Trigger Happy Lv3 will not appear for learning until you have learned
      Trigger Happy Lv2.
    - You must obtain a special item before certain ability is enabled for a
      job.

15. While you're selecting job to be tampered with, you may switch between
    girls with R1/L1. While you're selecting abilities to be learned, you may
    switch between DSP with L1/R1.

16. Once the ability accumulates predetermined amount of AP in order to be
    learned, the two numbers are replaced with a MASTER sign - meaning you've
    mastered that ability and can now use it in battle.

17. There's one more major difference you must be aware of - distinguishing
    between active and passive abilities.
    ACTIVE ABILITIES  - Active abilities are abilities you can choose from
                        when inside battles. Once an ACTA is selected, and
                        CTIM (if it's necessary) is full, ACTA will be
                        executed. Example of two ACTA: Cura and Protect
                        abilities of white mage.
    PASSIVE ABILITIES - Passive abilities are abilities that are always in
                        effect. You don't have to choose them - well, you
                        aren't able to - they work automatically as soon as
                        DSP is equipped. Example of two PASA: Slowproof and
                        Stopproof abilities of thief DSP.

---------------- G - MAIN MENU - ACCESSORIES HEADING - G0807 ----------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This will be a real easy one to handle. Once you select Accessories, you'll
be taken to gigantic list of all acc you've obtained so far.

1. Help line at the top, anyone?

2. Then you'll see two commands displayed.
   MANUAL - Let's you sort out items in your inventory. Place the cursor on
            the acc you wish to put somewhere else and press X. Blinking
            cursor will appear near first selected acc. What you do now is
            position another cursor at the second acc. When X is pressed
            again, these two acc will switch places.
   AUTO   - Acc will be arranged automatically.

3. When satisfied with arrangement, back out by pressing Circle.

4. You can hold a maximum of 99 units of one type of acc.


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
---------------- H - MAIN MENU - DRESSPHERESS HEADING - G0808 ---------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Easy as pie again (sighs in relief). What do you do here anyway? Not much,
except read some information on DSP you've acquired so far (ignores help line
on top).


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
------------------- I - MAIN MENU - CONFIG HEADING - G0809 ------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

In here you may toy around with 10 different aspects of gameplay (ignores
help line on top yet again).

1. First entry gets to deal around with Spherechanges sequences. By choosing
   leftmost option you will always view full transformation, by selecting
   middle you will only see second part of transformation, and selecting
   rightmost will show quickest Dress Up you ever saw (please note that
   transformations you get to see for the first time are viewed in their full
   glory, and are then shortened).

2. Second entry deals with ATB. You may select Active ATB (time ticks even
   when you're choosing items to be used, magic to be cast, enemy to be
   attacked etc.) or Wait ATB (time is stopped while you're choosing items to
   be used, magic to be cast, enemy to be attacked etc.). For starters I
   recommend choosing Wait ATB.

3. Third one dictates the speed of ATB bar, from slowest (leftmost choice) to
   fastest (rightmost choice).

4. Fourth entry applies to cursor - Memory setting will leave the cursor
   hanging near last command used, while Reset will always point the cursor
   at first command in girls' MCW.

5. Fifth one turns help line in battles on/off. I suggest leaving it on, for
   it may happen that you forget what does a particular item do. Or you may
   forget what does the ability you want to use do.

6. Sixth one dictates your vibration settings, which you can turn on or
   off... kinky, hehehe. If you're an avid player (like myself), turn
   vibration off - otherwise your hands will be hurting in the long run.

7. Seventh option turns subtitles during convos on/off.

8. Eighth option turns name subtitles during conversations on/off.

9. Ninth option turns minimap, which is displayed when walking around field
   screen, on/off. IMO you should always leave this on - it shows your
   current direction and your whereabouts.

10. Tenth option lets you choose between stereo/mono sound.

11. Final option allows you to change screen position by pressing and holding
    Square and using directionals or left stick to move the screen.

---------------------- A - BATTLE PREPARATIONS - G0901 ----------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

1. Equip your girls prior to battle with two pieces of acc (of course, right
   from the start you won't have any acc, but soon your acc collection will
   increase giving you the necessary edge in battle). Yes, I know that you
   can't predict what lies in future battle, but you're better off having at
   least something equipped than having nothing.

2. Always save whenever you see SSP, as they are invaluable to your progress.
   Not only do they restore party's HP/MP to full and recover any status
   changes that linger post-battle, but once you're after a certain tough
   spot in the game, you'll have a deep 'Phew!' after not having to repeat it
   again, should you encounter a game over afterwards.


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-------------------------- B - BATTLE START - G0902 -------------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

As you wander around in Field screen, suddenly a TV screen will shatter! Not
literally, but it is your warning that random battle has just issued! One of
three possible encounter setups await you:

1. Your party encounters enemy party and ATB bar is randomly outlined. It can
   happen that all three girls have a turn before all enemies, or all enemies
   act before girls do.

2. Your party is ambushed by enemy party. You'll know so by word 'Ambushed!'
   that appears at the top of battle screen. All enemies will act first. It
   doesn't matter how high girls' AGL is, enemies will always act first. Once
   enemies use the advantage of free attack, ATB returns to regular program.

3. Your party ambushes enemy party. You'll know so by words 'Pre-emptive
   strike!' that appears at top of battle screen. All girls will go first,
   regardless of AGL stat of the enemies. Once girls use the advantage of
   free attack, ATB order returns to regular program.


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
----------------------- C - MAIN COMMAND WINDOW - G0903 ---------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This is the command menu you'll be using the most when in battle. It is
located in lower left of battle screen. It houses several different commands
you can choose from (commands available to you depend on DSP used). Not all
commands are available straight away when DSP is equipped - but once you
learn a specific ability that falls into one of the command categories, that
command will become selectable. Each command, when chosen, will as next step
require you to select a target, or lead you to a submenu where even more
options await you. For a complete and detailed information on various MCW
commands, throw a look at section 14, Dressphere abilities. Here I'll list
the four most important ones.

1. ATTACK (attack an enemy with equipped weapon)
Very simple. After you select Attack command, you'll be prompted to select
one of the targets on the battlefield. By default marker (which is in a shape
of gold triangle) will point to one of the enemies on the battlefield. Choose
carefully who you want to attack. If help window is enabled (you'll know so
by the additional line at top of the screen), it'll show the name of the
target you're attempting to attack (note that if target has been affected by
status changes, you will see small icons of those changes to the right of
target's name). Once the target is selected, girl performing the action will
try to physically attack the target.

2. ITEM (use an item)
Select this to be taken to another submenu, where you select an item, then
select the target to use that item on and press X for one final time. Item
command is available to any job.

3. DRESS UP (change jobs)
On any girl's turn press L1 to be taken to that girl's equipped GG. It will
be displayed on most of the screen, while in upper right corner you will be
able to view flow of battle in a minimized window. Choose one of DSP (which
*isn't* DSP currently equipped) and press X to have the girl change into new
job. You can only select DSP that are one link away from currently equipped
DSP (gates aren't included in this equation). If the job change causes the
girl to take a pass thru one of the gates on GG, then she may be bestowed
with a special effect, like gaining new spell, gaining element properties to
her PATK or increasing certain statistics. Detailed information on special
effects granted are discussed in Garment Grid section of this guide.

4. SPECIAL DRESS UP (change into special DSP)
If one of the girls has changed into every single DSP she has inserted on her
currently equipped GG (all nodes on GG must be occupied by DSP!), and on that
girl's turn, press L1 to be taken to that girl's equipped GG. Special Dress
Up command will appear - press R1 to activate it, then press X to complete
the process. Other two girls will leave the battlefield and girl doing
Special Dress Up will transform into some serious kick-ass job. Even though
girl fights alone, her transformation has three independent parts - you will
have to input commands for each part.


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
----------------------- D - SUB COMMAND WINDOW - G0904 ----------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This screen is also found in lower left of battle screen. But to access it,
you must press right when in main command screen. It houses one single
command you can choose from.

1. ESCAPE (run away from battle)
Select it, and then press X for girl to attempt to escape; she may or may not
succeed in escaping. Any you can't escape from boss fights and some special
battles.


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
------------------------ E - ATB BAR / WINDOW - G0905 -----------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Alpha and Omega of the battle, you *must* learn to use ATB efficiently. When
it's time to do battle, ATB bar is your destiny. ATB is displayed in lower
right corner of the screen. I'll try my best to explain the flow of it in
easy-to-understand nature with a help of few pics along the way to illustrate
some examples.

1. First rule: When girl's ATB is full, *only then* can she issue a command
   to be used for her turn. Girl cannot act if her ATB is empty or half full.
   It must be *full*. Remember that - always! ATB bar is represented as a
   green bar - once it is full, girl has a turn and you can issue commands.

2. Second rule: Depending on DSP used, girls can have ATB bars of variable
   lengths. For example, if Rikku is thief and Paine is dark knight, Rikku's
   ATB bar will fill up much faster than Paine's - just to illustrate, Rikku
   will be getting two turns for one Paine's.

3. Third rule: With rare exceptions, almost everything girls will try to
   perform, requires CTIM. CTIM is represented by a purple bar - once purple
   bar is full, CTIM for action selected is completed and action will be
   executed. Different actions require different CTIM, and stronger actions
   require longer CTIM. Furthermore, there are actions that are executed
   immediately, but delay girl's next turn a lot (two examples follow a bit
   below). You also need to take into equation girl's AGL stat - if it's very
   low, it will take her forever before her ATB bar and CTIM bar will fill up
   - the higher girl's AGL is, the faster / shorter those two bars will be.

4. Fourth rule: Once girl's CTIM action is executed, ATB bar may not appear.
   This means that girl's turn is already up, so you can issue next command.
   However, after certain types of CTIM actions ATB bar still needs to be
   filled before girl can act again. Whether or not ATB bar appears after
   CTIM depends on action executed. Do not worry, I'll take this into account
   when explaining action is Dressphere section of this guide.

5. Example 1: Let's say that Paine in warrior has chosen to perform Armor
   Break skill. Skill will not be executed immediately, instead it requires
   CTIM. You'll see Paine take a special stance and an aura will appear
   around her, as well as Paine's green ATB bar being replaced with purple
   CTIM bar, slowly filling. Once CTIM is full, Armor Break is used on
   specified target. Take a look at following pic to see what I mean.
   http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/actionchargetime.jpg

6. Example 2: I'll combine two aspects in this pic. Rikku is thief and Yuna
   is songstress. Let's assume Rikku uses Potion and Yuna uses Darkness
   Dance. Rikku's action requires CTIM, whereas Yuna's action will be
   executed immediately, but her next turn will be delayed. In the picture
   link below you may see how it works (long green bar represents Yuna's,
   while shorter blue bar is Rikku's).
   http://splitinfinity.50megs.com/images/nextturncharge.jpg

7. In addition, ATB bar also has others colors it can be bestowed with, but I
   discuss these changes in the Character's condition section.

8. Any type of attack which deals damage will temporarily meddle with your
   bar filling process. Do note that same also applies for fiends (even
   though you can't normally see their bars).


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
------------------------- F - CHARACTER BAR - G0906 -------------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Character bar is situated in lower right corner of battle screen and is tied
very closely with the ATB bar. I could've thrown it in the same pool with ATB
bar, but there are differences that must be taken care of.

1. You will see three girls' bars represented in following fashion: girl's
   name, followed by her current HP and MP. You can only get to view girl's
   MAX HP and/or MP value if girl is targeted with relevant spell (Cure) or
   item (X-Potion).

2. Pay close attention to girls' HP (especially on this one!) and MP values.
   If HP is depleted to 0, girl is KO-ed and cannot fight anymore until
   revived. If MP is depleted to 0, girl can't use any of MP consuming
   abilities - this seriously hampers girl's fighting capabilities, so do
   your best to never run out of MP.

3. HP counter comes in handy when distinguishing girl's status by looking at
   the color of HP counter:
   FINE     - Girl is doing fine if her HP are at least 33% (and above) MAX
              HP. HP counter in this case is displayed white.
   CRITICAL - Girl is in critical condition once her HP fall below 33% of her
              MAX HP. You will know so by two things: girl will assume
              kneeling stance and her HP will be displayed yellow. She also
              requires more time to act and recover from hits she's taking.
   KO-ED    - Girl is KO-ed (or otherwise incapacitated) if HP counter is
              displayed red. This is really unfavorable for your battles, so
              remedy the situation quickly.

4. MP counter comes in handy when distinguishing girl's ability to use MP
   consuming actions by looking at the color of HP counter:
   FINE      - Girl is doing fine if her MP are at least 33% (and above) MAX
               MP. MP counter in this case is displayed white.
   CRITICAL  - Girl hasn't got much MP to toy with if her MP fall below 33%
               of her MAX MP. MP counter will be displayed yellow if this
               would be the case. If her MP is too low for some MP consuming
               abilities to be used, she won't be able to even select them.
   OUT OF MP - Girl can't use MP consuming actions if her MP is depleted. MP
               counter is displayed red in this case. This is really
               unfavorable for your battles, so remedy the situation quickly.

5. Finally, sometimes you'll see a strange white bar appear instead of HP and
   MP counters. When can this come in handy? If a girl is under status
   change, but you don't know what that is, target that girl with status
   affecting skill or status-lifting item. Voila! Instead of white bar being
   empty you will see one of many symbols that represent status effect - to
   name two: shield icon represents protect status, and 4-star symbol
   represents regen status. Learn status' symbols well, for it will save you
   in a rough situation many times.

---------------------- G - BATTLE TIPS & TRICKS - G0907 ---------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

In here I'll list down any helpful info or hints I can think of to ease the
suffering of enemies that try to get any funny ideas... and in case they
succeed, what to do to fix the situation.

1. You lose control of a girl if she is berserked, confused, petrified or
   under KO. Berserk is not necessarily bad, as she continues to attack
   enemies with increased Str, you just can't control her. Confused girl is a
   different story altogether - use Esuna or Remedy on her quickly... or hit
   (on) her. Petrified girl is a mixed bag... if she receives any type of
   damage, she will shatter and be gone from this battle permanently - Soft
   or Esuna used quickly will ensure that will never happen. KO-ed girl is of
   no use to you, therefore Phoenix Down or Life will give her a second
   chance.

2. Increase girls' amount of turns by increasing AGL. You can do so in many
   ways: Chocobo Feather, Chocobo Wing, Haste, Hastega, Auto-Haste acc or one
   of many AGL-increasing skills.

3. Decrease enemies' amount of turns by decreasing their AGL or incurring
   certain statuses. Decrease enemies' AGL with one of many AGL-decreasing
   skills or use Delay skills to let enemies never even get the attack in.
   Putting enemies to sleep and then whacking them with magic attacks is also
   an excellent way of winning the battle.

4. Augment your DEF and MDEF with Protect and Shell respectively (both
   increase the resistance by 50%).

5. Make enemies hit themselves with magic by having Reflect on (for permanent
   effect wear Star Bracer acc).

6. Each attack enemy does to you will make them feel the pain right back with
   help of Counter and Magic Counter skills. Note that you cannot counter
   multitarget PATK or MATK. Only berserker DSP has counterattack skills.

7. Steal from enemies often. Many a time enemy carries an item you aren't
   able to buy. Same goes for Bribing - many rare and most useful items can
   be gotten that way.

8. Beware! Over the course of game enemies in certain areas are replaced by
   other enemies, which are far stronger. For example: in CH1 you will
   encounter Coyote on Besaid island. However, one of the enemies encountered
   on Besaid in CH5 will be Malboro! Don't get me started on other areas...

9. If say both Rikku and Yuna attack same enemy, but Rikku's attack KO-es
   that enemy, fret not! Yuna's attack will not go to waste - instead she
   automatically targets closest enemy.

10. Pay attention to enemies' battle stances. They help tremendously in
    figuring out what an enemy will do. You can easily tamper with their
    status this way (for example, you see that an enemy is charging MATK, so
    you throw Silence Grenade at it to disable next attack).
    MAGICAL          - if you see some kind of aura surround the enemy, this
                       usually denotes it's charging up MATK
    SPECIAL PHYSICAL - if you see the enemy take funny fighting stance or
                       it's movement becomes faster, this usually denotes
                       enemy's charging a special PATK
    REGULAR PHYSICAL - if enemy unleashes the attack immediately, you've been
                       hit with a regular PATK

11. Word 'MISS' will appear sometimes during battle. What can cause this?
    - If girl is darknessed and she attacks her target with PATK, there's a
      high possibility that she will miss connecting her attack to desired
      target. In this case 'MISS' will pop up telling that. Similarly, if
      target's EVA is way superior to attacker's ACCU, attack may miss. This
      applies for both your team and the enemies.
    - Casting same status on same target for second time will usually result
      in a 'MISS'. For example, trying to put darkness on the enemy after it
      has already been affected by it is meaningless. This isn't the case if
      status effect is stackable or status has been lifted by means of
      dispeling it, timelapse or hitting affected target.
    - If target is asleep or stopped, PATK will always connect.

12. If at any time you're unsure of who you're targeting with an attack or
    can't distinguish well enough between monster's name and its outside
    appearance, throw a look at the battlefield! There will be a white circle
    on the ground surronding target of your attack as well as yellow triangle
    pointing down on same target.


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
------------------------- H - DISTANCE EFFECT - G0908 -----------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Totally new aspect introduced into FF genre! And hard to explain.

1. First thing to remember is that your team is not the only one with
   distance effect. Enemies are capable of unleashing such attacks as well.

2. See distance effect in action in following event: let's say that your
   whole team is very close to one Coyote. All three choose to physically
   attack that Coyote. Now because all three are close to their target,
   Coyote will sustain three attacks in short amount of time, getting 'Chain
   x 2!' with ease.

3. In regards to point 2. of this issue distance effect is usually not
   successful in following event: two gals are close to target Coyote, while
   third gal is very far away. All three girls choose to physically attack
   that Coyote - Paine's and Rikku's attack will connect immediately, while
   Yuna needs say two seconds to get to where Coyote is and slice it down.
   Taking this into the equation, Coyote will sustain two attacks in very
   short amount of time (resulting in 'Chain x 1!'), while third attack will
   *not* result in 'Chain x 2!', simply because too much time elapsed between
   2nd and 3rd attack. So you will need to time your attacks effectively as
   well.


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-------------------------- I - RANGE EFFECT - G0909 -------------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

1. Sometimes range effect is applied. There isn't whole lot of attacks that
   fall in this category. In fact, the only I found so far is Mr B.'s Glint,
   which covers wide circular range around him - if any girls are found
   within Glint's range, they suffer damage. However, if all girls are
   outside of range, none of them suffers damage. Sweet.

2. A cheesy way of staying outside such attacks' ranges is by applying jobs
   that attack from a distance - these include gunner, lady luck, alchemist,
   trainer and gun mage. Simply stand at your initial battle position and
   fire away all you want.


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
---------------------- J - EFFECT OF THE 'ARC' - G0910 ----------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

1. Sometimes an enemy possesses an attack which usually hurts all three
   girls, like Zalamander's Flame Breath, for example. However, pay attention
   to attack's animation! If you look closely, you'll see that it sweeps over
   the battlefield, dealing damage to all caught in the blast. The most
   important aspect to notice is that it can't affect THE WHOLE battlefield,
   only a portion of it, thus making this attack fall into category of what I
   call 'arc attack'.

2. How can you benefit from such attacks? Should your girls be very far away
   from each other (for example, forming a triangle around Zalamander), then
   it would be able to damage only two of your girls (even just only one,
   should you be extremely lucky). Know this battle aspect and use it well!


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-------------------- K - HIT THE FRONT OR BEHIND? - G0911 -------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

1. Believe it or not, but girls' and enemies' battle positions are important
   in one more aspect. For example, if Yuna is facing Coyote head on and she
   attacks it, she'll deal 100 damage to Coyote.

2. However, if Coyote is having its back turned towards Yuna, and she attacks
   it, damage inflicted will be doubled, meaning Coyote will suffer 200
   damage! This doesn't count as critical strike.

3. In cases when luck is on your side as well, and Yuna manages to hit Coyote
   in the back with critical strike occuring, damage inflicted will be
   quadrupled! In this case Coyote will suffer 400 damage.

4. Of course, enemies can use this weakness on your girls as well. You have
   been warned.


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
---------------------------- L - CHAINING - G0912 ---------------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

1. If enemy is attacked by a number of consecutive attacks, 'Chain x 1!',
   'Chain x 2!', 'Chain x 3!' and so on will sometimes pop up with each
   successful strike. What's in it for you? Well, damage done by each
   successive attack that connects is greater than usual. You can use many
   ways to try to achieve chaining - have all three gals attack same enemy at
   the same time, or have one girl throw Fire Gem at one enemy, followed by
   other two attacking it. Try out different combos for maximum effect
   possible. Beware - enemies are capable of same chaining effect on your
   team!

2. Once you land a successful hit on your target, you must quickly strike it
   again while target is still recovering from being hit. If you manage to do
   it, chaining has begun. Note that the target still recovering from
   previous strike cannot evade next attack.

3. In case you succeed landing critical strike, target hit requires more time
   to recover from the hit, allowing you more time to coordinate your attacks
   into chaining session.

4. And here's the formula for chained damage: 'Chain x 1!' damage is 1,45
   times the original hit, and any other hit afterwards is .05 times more
   than the last (thanks to Zeruel for this). Maximum value you can reach is
   more than 600%.


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
--------------------- M - ACTIVE / WAIT ATB MODE - G0913 --------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

You will notice a sign alternating between 'Active mode' and 'Wait mode' in
upper right corner of battle screen. What exactly does this tell you?

1. If ATB mode is set to Active, time always passes. Time passes even if
   you're ransacking your items desperately seeking that X-Potion you know
   you've put somewhere... or by pondering if you should choose Armor or
   Magic Break. Only use Active mode if you're a skilled player already. If
   this is your first FF game or are not yet familiar with ATB system, don't
   use this mode.

2. If ATB mode is set to Wait, time only passes while you're selecting one of
   girl's commands on MCW. As soon as you enter a submenu of any type (item
   menu or white magic menu), time stops ('Active mode' sign will change to
   'Wait mode') and you can take all the time you wish to select the
   necessary means of turning battle into your favor.

3. Time is also stopped (ie set to 'Wait mode' automatically) during some of
   battle's longer animations. Listing those would just be waste of time, for
   there are many such events.


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
---------------------- N - GREEN / WHITE NUMBERS - G0914 --------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

1. As soon as you enter first battle of the game and you land first hit upon
   the enemies, you'll notice either white or green number appear briefly as
   the hit is being made. This section will explain to you what those numbers
   represent. Don't make such a scared face, it's really easy!

2. WHITE NUMBERS indicate HP loss, or that damage which reduces target's
   current HP has been inflicted. I'll give you an example of what I mean:
   Say Yuna encounters Coyote, which has 74 HP. She hits it with PATK,
   dealing 50 damage to Coyote. You will know so because white number '50'
   will appear briefly, denoting amount of damage you've done. Should you
   bother to scan Coyote afterwards, you'd notice that it has 24 HP now.

3. GREEN NUMBERS indicate HP recovery, or that some/most of target's current
   HP has been recovered. Here's an example: Say Yuna (she has 100 HP) fights
   Coyote. It hits her with PATK, dealing 50 damage to her - Yuna now has 50
   HP. So we need to heal her quickly - choose a Potion and use it on her.
   You will see green number '200' will appear briefly, denoting that same
   amount of HP has just been added to Yuna's current HP. Should you bother
   to scan Yuna afterwards, you'd notice that she has 250 HP now.

4. WHITE NUMBERS PRECEEDED BY 'MP' WORD indicate MP loss, or that damage
   which reduces target's current MP has been inflicted. I'll give you an
   example of what I mean: Say Yuna encounters Sahagin, which has 28 MP. She
   reduces it's MP by hitting it with special attack, dealing 20 MP damage to
   Sahagin. You will know so because white number 'MP 20' will appear
   briefly, denoting amount of MP damage you've done. Should you bother to
   scan Sahagin afterwards, you'd notice that it has 8 MP now.

5. GREEN NUMBERS PRECEEDED BY 'MP' WORD indicate MP recovery, or that
   some/most of target's current MP has been recovered. Here's an example:
   Say Yuna (she has 200 MP) encounters Coyote. It hits her with special
   attack, dealing 150 MP damage to her - Yuna now has 50 MP. So we need to
   heal her quickly - choose an Ether and use it on her. You will see green
   number 'MP 100' appear briefly, denoting that same amount of MP has just
   been added to Yuna's current MP. Should you bother to scan Yuna now, you'd
   notice that she has 150 MP now.


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
---------------------- O - ELEMENTAL PROPERTIES - G0915 ---------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

1. There are SEVEN ELEMENTS present in FFX-2. Those elements are: FIRE, ICE,
   LIGHTNING, WATER, HOLY, GRAVITY and NON-ELEMENTAL.

2. FIRE and ICE oppose each other, as do LIGHTNING and WATER. HOLY has no
   opposing element - same goes for GRAVITY and NON-ELEMENTAL.

3. All elements (except non-elemental) are affected by target's corresponding
   element affinities, so be careful of what you're trying to have fun with.
   These affinities are: WEAKNESS, STRONG, NULLIFY or ABSORB.

4. If you don't understand what I mean, here's how you should interpret
   information provided.
   - WEAKNESS: Normally fire based attacks deal 200 damage per hit to target
     ELEMWEAK  enemy. But let's say Coyote is weak to fire damage. In this
               case each hit of fire based attack would deal double damage to
               Coyote - 400 damage!
   - STRONG  : Normally fire based attacks deal 200 damage per hit to target
     ELEMHALF  enemy. But let's say Coyote is strong to fire damage. In this
               case each hit of fire based attack would deal 50% less damage
               to Coyote - 100 damage!
   - NULLIFY : Normally fire based attacks deal 200 damage per hit to target
     ELEMIMM   enemy. But let's say Coyote is immune to fire damage. In this
               case each hit of fire based attack would deal zero (0) damage
               to Coyote - *no* damage!
   - ABSORB  : Normally fire based attacks deal 200 damage per hit to target
     ELEMABS   enemy. But let's say Coyote absorbs fire damage as HP
               recovery. In this case each hit of fire based attack would
               restore 200 HP to Coyote.
   So know your enemies before you try sending them to their doom! Otherwise
   it may very well be other way around.

5. Of special mention is non-elemental property. None of target's element
   affinities have any effect on damage inflicted by non-elemental attacks.
   The only way to reduce the damage is by having shell POSSE on the target.
   Some types of non-elemental attacks are Flare and Ultima.

--------------------------- P - BATTLE END - G0916 --------------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

1. Battle ends in one of following scenarios:
   - all enemies are killed
   - some/all enemies have escaped and/or the rest is killed
   - all three gals are KO-ed, petrified or shattered (GAME OVER!)
   - girls have been ejected from battle

2. You must remember something important! If *at least one* girl has managed
   to escape current battle, you avoid Game over. The other two can get
   knocked around as much as they want and possibly get KO-ed in the end, but
   this *will not* warrant Game over for you, because one of the gals
   escaped.


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
------------------------ Q - POST-BATTLE INFO - G0917 -----------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Once enemies have been barbecued (or you escaped), post-battle screen will
greet you. It has following elements...

1. As usual, there's a help line on top.

2. EXP and gil award for current battle are displayed in upper left corner.
   EXP is not shared, so each girl gets full EXP. Girl doesn't receive EXP if
   she's KO-ed, petrified or has pointless status. There are also some other
   circumstances in which girl doesn't receive EXP, but I will address this
   in relevant place.

3. Below EXP and gil lines Items you won from current fight are displayed.
   These are added to your inventory. You may win acc as well.

4. Right half of the screen shows three gals' EXP status, presented in
   following manner: girl's pic, name, LV, current EXP, EXP needed for next
   level. If girl gains enough EXP from current fight to advance to next
   level, words 'LEVEL UP!!' will appear above gal's info box.

5. Below girls' info boxes amount of gil you currently have is displayed.

6. Once EXP and gil have been added, you will be prompted to press X to
   return to field screen.

7. Should you manage to kill some enemies, but you then escape (or the rest
   of the enemies flees), you get EXP, gil and items for any enemies you
   managed to defeat up to the point of fleeing.

10.)                      CHARACTER'S STATUS - G1000
=============================================================================
=============================================================================

Spellspring* ----- G1043 |
=============================================================================
Note that statuses in above mini-TOC are listed the way they're shown inside
the game's basics tutorial. For my and your convenience I'll arrange them
alphabetically when explaining them.
* - Shattering, Delay, Action-cancel and Spellspring are what I would call
hidden status effects - they aren't mentioned in the tutorial, but they exist
nevertheless. More info on what they do in their respective sections.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-------------------------- A - STATUS BASICS - G1001 ------------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

1. By looking at the above mini-TOC you see that there's indeed many statuses
   you can have fun with in FFX-2. I do miss zombie status, sniff - too bad
   they haven't included it. Oh well, we'll have to make due with what we
   have left.

2. After noting down each status, here's the final matchup - 25 negative VS
   17 positive statuses. During your trip you're sure to come across at least
   2/3 of this list, and if in certain tight spot you don't know what status
   is for, you might be screwed royally.

3. So you've been affected by a certain status, but don't know what it was?
   There's three ways to tell what your girls have fallen under.
   - visual representation of status in effect (cursed girl will flash black
     every so often)
   - white bar replacing character bar if girl in question is targeted with
     status affecting spell/item (on this bar small icons representing
     statuses in effect will appear)
   - some other representation, unique to this status

4. Most of NEGSE can be prevented from occuring by equipping acc with
   relevant anti-skill. Also some jobs have inherent anti-skills which
   prevent status from happening. If however, you still get caught by
   surprise and girl has been granted NEGSE, you can cure that status in many
   ways: Esuna, Remedy, or status-lifting item made esp for that status (Echo
   Screen for silence). Or in dire situation, KO the girl and then revive her
   - any status will be gone (ok, any status but petrified, since you may
   shatter poor girl instead).

5. Most of POSSE is beneficial to you, so you should keep in mind to always
   be in at least one POSSE to ensure easy victories. With that said, don't
   expect enemies to just let you become super-powerful. They have and will
   use any means necessary to negate the effects of POSSE.

6. Some of POSSE come as AAB on acc, so make sure you equip those. You may
   wish to employ some of white magics to come around few of POSSE game has
   to offer. Also many other jobs offer ways of affecting your team with
   desired POSSE - there are many choices, you just need to seek them out.


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
------------------- B - STATUS CHART OVERVIEW / EXPLANATION -----------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Before I dig into explaining statuses, a nicely laid out chart is necessary.
It will show how I intend to outline the info one needs to know on certain
status effect.

CHART OVERVIEW
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. NAME?                   | STACKS       | POST-B.      | TIME/HIT
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. It does...?
3. Visual feature?
4. Icon feature?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHART EXPLANATION
1. Name of the status, followed by three pieces of info:
   - Some of NEGSE and POSSE can be stacked. What does that mean? If a target
     is hit with same status again and if that status is stackable, then the
     effect/s of statuses increase, thus giving target further advantages (in
     case POSSE can be stacked) or disadvantages (in case NEGSE can be
     stacked). Ultimately, you should aim to inflict stackable NEGSE on your
     enemies, and stackable POSSE on your team.*
   - Does status in question remain after battle?**
   - Adresses the issue if status is lifted automatically after some time
     has elapsed and / or if status is lifted if target is hit by PATK.***
       * - 'No' means status doesn't stack. 'Yes' means status can stack.
      ** - 'No' means status is lifted at end of battle. 'Yes' means status
           remains even after battle is won.
     *** - 'Time' means status is lifted automatically after some time
           elapses. 'Hit' means status is lifted if target is hit by PATK.
           'Both' means that status is lifted if either some time elapses or
           target is hit by PATK. 'None' means that status cannot be cured by
           time-lapse or hitting target with PATK.

2. What does status in question really do.

3. If there's a visual feature of status being in effect, what *is* that
   feature?

4. If no visual feature of status being in effect is given, icon feature is
   presented *for sure* and will clear any doubts. Okay, I lied - DELEF and
   ACTIC don't have icon feature; you will need to rely on your monster
   knowledge.

----------------------------- C - STATUS HEROES -----------------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Let us begin the dance with POSSE! There's 17 entries in this category.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                 Each level increases ACCU by 10 points.
Visual feature?- None.
Icon feature?  - Bulls-eye with arrow pointing up. Small number in lower
                 right represents SSTLV.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Auto-Life - G1014          | STACKS - no  | POST-B. - no   | TIME/HIT - hit
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                 Each level decreases physical damage taken by 1/12. Attacks
                 that deal fractional damage are not affected by this status.
Visual feature?- None.

                 right represents SSTLV.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Haste - G1019              | STACKS - no  | POST-B. - no   | TIME/HIT - time
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It does...?    - ATB bar turns red, however it only charges about 5% faster
                 as before. Haste *doesn't* increase target's AGL, it affects
                 the speed at which attacks are executed (for example warrior
                 using Attack command), thus allowing target to enter CTIM or
                 RECTIM sooner.
Visual feature?- ATB bar is red, target's movements become faster.
Icon feature?  - Blue running figure.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Invincible - G1032         | STACKS - no  | POST-B. - no   | TIME/HIT - time
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It does...?    - Target becomes invincible. Any further attacks of any type
                 on such target will fail. Beware - status changes still work
                 and target can be affected by both POSSE and NEGSE.
Visual feature?- None.
Icon feature?  - Black figure inside blue star-shaped circle.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                 right represents SSTLV.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It does...?    - Target's MAG stat is increased. Can be stacked 10x maximum.
                 Each level increases magical damage given by 1/12. Attacks
                 that deal fractional damage are not affected by this status.
Visual feature?- None.
Icon feature?  - Staff with arrow pointing up. Small number in lower right
                 represents SSTLV.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

It does...?    - Target's MDEF stat is increased. Can be stacked 10x maximum.
                 Each level decreases magical damage taken by 1/12. Attacks
                 that deal fractional damage are not affected by this status.
Visual feature?- None.
Icon feature?  - White robe with arrow pointing up. Small number in lower
                 right represents SSTLV.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Null Magic - G1031        | STACKS - no  | POST-B. - no   | TIME/HIT - time*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It does...?    - Target is immune to any type of MATK. In short, any type of
                 magic damage is nullified.
Visual feature?- None. Attacking targets under this POSSE with MATK will
                 produce 'IMMUNE' word to appear when target is hit.
Icon feature?  - Staff with single red line behind it.
* note         - enemies that have this POSSE will always remain under it
                 once the battle starts

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Null Physical - G1030      | STACKS - no  | POST-B. - no   | TIME/HIT - time*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It does...?    - Target is immune to any type of PATK. In short, any type of
                 physical damage is nullified.
Visual feature?- None. Attacking targets under this POSSE with PATK will
                 produce 'IMMUNE' word to appear when target is hit.
Icon feature?  - Sword with single red line behind it.
* note         - enemies that have this POSSE will always remain under it
                 once the battle starts

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Protect - G1016            | STACKS - no  | POST-B. - no   | TIME/HIT - time
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It does...?    - Target takes 50% less damage from any type of PATK. There
                 are PATK that ignore protect (if latter is in effect).
                 Please note that protect doesn't influence DEF stat - it
                 merely decreases phd received.
Visual feature?- Blue multi-hexagon shield appears once target is hit with
                 any type of PATK (excluding those which ignore protect).
Icon feature?  - Encircled blue shield.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reflect - G1017            | STACKS - no  | POST-B. - no   | TIME/HIT - time
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It does...?    - Target reflects (ie bounces) most single-target white/black
                 magic spells back towards the caster. Target cannot reflect
                 multi-target spells like Demi.
Visual feature?- White wall appears if target is hit with reflectable spell.
Icon feature?  - Encircled white robe with broken arrow on its left side.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It does...?    - Target regenerates fraction of HP for a set amount of time.
                 HP restored equals roughly 3% of target's MAX HP. Regen is
                 ineffective if target is in stop status.
Visual feature?- Purple stars appearing around target's body.
Icon feature?  - Four small stars.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shell - G1015              | STACKS - no  | POST-B. - no   | TIME/HIT - time
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It does...?    - Target takes 50% less damage from any type of MATK. There
                 are MATK that ignore shell (if latter is in effect). Please
                 note that shell doesn't influence MDEF stat - it merely
                 decreases mgd received.
Visual feature?- Orange sphere appears once target is hit with any type of
                 MATK (excluding those which ignore shell).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It does...?    - Target's MP consumption for any type of skill or magic which
                 requires MP in order to be cast/used becomes zero. Also,
                 dark knights no longer expend HP for Darkness ACTA.
Visual feature?- All abilities that require MP will have 0 (zero) listed.
Icon feature?  - None.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It does...?    - Target's STR stat is increased. Can be stacked 10x maximum.
                 Each level increases physical damage given by 1/12. Attacks
                 that deal fractional damage are not affected by this status.
Visual feature?- None.
Icon feature?  - Sword with arrow pointing up. Small number in lower right
                 represents SSTLV.


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
---------------------------- D - STATUS BADASSES ----------------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

It's time for the other side of the medal. Introducing NEGSE! 25 entries are
in this section.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACCU down - G1037          | STACKS - yes | POST-B. - no   | TIME/HIT - none
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It does...?    - Target's ACCU stat is decreased. Can be stacked 10x maximum.
                 Each level decreases ACCU by 10 points.

Icon feature?  - Bulls-eye with arrow pointing down. Small number in lower
                 right represents SSTLV.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action-cancel - G1042      | STACKS - no  | POST-B. - no   | TIME/HIT - *
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It does...?    - Target enters a command which requires CTIM in order to be
                 executed - if target is attacked during CTIM phase with an
                 ability that has ACTIC properties, target's command is
                 canceled and target's ATB bar starts anew. Do not mix up
                 this status with DELEF - they have different properties!
Visual feature?- Target's stance during CTIM phase is canceled.
Icon feature?  - None.
* note         - There's no real way to prevent this status, as it happens in
                 matter of seconds. In same amount of seconds this status is
                 'gone', too.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Berserk - G1009            | STACKS - no  | POST-B. - no   | TIME/HIT - time
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It does...?    - Target's STR is increased by +1 level (only in some cases!).
                 Target can only use normal PATK. If one of your girls is
                 affected, you lose command of affected girl. Berserk
                 inflicted on enemies wears off after a while. Same applies
                 to the girls. Berserked enemies may use other forms of
                 attacks.
Visual feature?- Target's body emanates red color.
Icon feature?  - Red flaming sword.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Confuse - G1008            | STACKS - no  | POST-B. - no   | TIME/HIT - both
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It does...?    - Target becomes confused and attacks enemies/allies alike. If
                 one of girls is confused, you lose command of affected girl
                 - she may choose to use any command currently at her
                 disposal and execute it, provided she has means to do it.
                 Confuse inflicted on enemies wears off after a while.
Visual feature?- Two stars appear around target's head.
Icon feature?  - Red question mark.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Curse - G1010              | STACKS - no  | POST-B. - no   | TIME/HIT - none
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It does...?    - Target's ACCU stat is decreased, target often misses when
                 trying to land PATK.
Visual feature?- Black mist surrounds target's head.
Icon feature?  - Four black blobs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Doom - G1029               | STACKS - no  | POST-B. - no   | TIME/HIT - time
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It does...?    - Once timer above target's head reaches 0 (zero), target is
                 KO-ed. Timer is stopped while target is in stop status.
Visual feature?- Red timer appears above target's head.
Icon feature?  - Black skull in white circle.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Delay effect - G1041       | STACKS - no  | POST-B. - no   | TIME/HIT - *
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It does...?    - Can affect both target's ATB and/or CTIM bars, which are
                 emptied by a predetermined %. The % of ATB/CTIM bar depleted
                 must fill up again before target can issue commands. In
                 short, this status delays (and possibly cancels) target's
                 next action input. Two examples of DELEF follow.
                 Example 1: Rikku's ATB bar is full, she's about to issue a
                 command and she's fighting Iron Giant (its attack has
                 DELEF). ATB mode is set to 'Active'. While Rikku is choosing
                 an item to use, she's attacked by Iron Giant, who manages to
                 hit her. You'll notice two things: your item menu will
                 disappear and Rikku's green ATB bar will be emptied a bit
                 (once it fills back up, Rikku will have another try to enter
                 the command). Why? Because her turn has been canceled and
                 delayed a bit.
                 Example 2: Same battle as before, only this time Rikku is in
                 CTIM phase for using Potion on herself. She's attacked and
                 suffers damage. You'll notice one thing this time around -
                 Rikku's CTIM bar will be emptied a bit. Once a target is in
                 CTIM phase, action *cannot be canceled*, only delayed.
Visual feature?- Target's ATB/CTIM bar is pushed to left, as if being
                 emptied. Amount taken away will eventually fill back up to
                 previous value.
Icon feature?  - None.
* note         - There's no real way to prevent this status, as it happens in
                 matter of seconds. In same amount of seconds this status is
                 'gone', too.

It does...?    - Target's AGL is zero, ATB bar turns white color, commands

                        explore; there will be few marks added as well

                              left corner of main menu; use it as a
                              crossreference

                        SSP - if this sign follows the name of area, it means
                              save sphere is located somewhere in the area

                        N   - sometimes when you'll look at area map, you'll
                        S     notice one of the many symbols in the left
                        E     column which are thrown into connecting lines
                        W     between two areas; this simply means that area
                        NE    you're currently at has more than two exits and
                        NW    by taking say NW exit you reach next area;
                        SE    if it sounds confusing, it soon won't anymore
                        SW    once you run into an actual example

                        come on accessories; items will be listed on the left
                        side of the chart, while acc will be listed on the
                        right side (there are some shops that sell only acc)

##################### - introduces optional stuff sections, or sidequests, if
                        you wish to call it so; doing things mentioned inside
                        is totally optional, but recommended nevertheless,
                        for you can gain additional levels, story %, as well
                        as new DSP, GG and acc

1. 'Swipe' - VS one chr - phd
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
Rikku starts as thief, and Paine as warrior. Okay, onto the battle at last...
????'s first move will be using Ecstasy on both of her allies, which will
double their MAX HP and bestow regen upon them. Nothing really worrying, as it
only restores 1 HP. Nyah nyah. They also try to be dangerous by being hasted,
but that's not a major threat either. Anyway, take care of both Goons with few
well placed PATK.

Only ???? remains standing. While you're busy finishing off sidekicks, she'll
pummel you with Thunder for about 10 damage. In case their regen or haste
wears off, she'll recast it. Steal Hi-Potion from her, then finish her as
well. If you manage to defeat ???? first, battle is not over yet. You must
defeat all three to proceed.

* note - Two Goons fought in this battle have 29 HP each. Goons you'll be
meeting in subsequent battles will have 13 HP each.
*****************************************************************************

After a scene you will appear in Luca harbor. Ahead you'll see runaway gal,
with Paine chasing closely behind her. Note that your HP/MP are restored
automatically, so don't worry about having low HP/MP. If you enter main menu,
only three choices will be available to you: Items, Accessories and Config
(switch ATB mode to Wait Mode!).

You're controlling Rikku, so go N. Or wait... you'll automatically fall into a
battle against two easy enemies. Waste them, then proceed N to next screen.
Beware, there is no end to the enemies... you may fight them for easy EXP, if
you wish. I suggest learning Pilfer Gil for Rikku and Sentinel for Paine. As
you reach next screen, you'll again see runaway gal. This time, if you're
caught, you square off against four enemies. Kill enemy magicians last, they
only do 3 damage max with Fire.

On this screen go W to reach the pier - look for a funny animal. Recognize the
trademark used? If you examine it with X, your HP/MP will get restored. This
is important event for 100% in one game. There's nothing else to do here, so
leave the screen by going N. Paine is all alone, so go up a bit...

1. 'Double shot' - VS one chr - phd, 2 hits
2. Potion - on himself or Fatso - target recovers 20 HP
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
Odds may seem against you, but fret not, you can't die so easily. Fatso will
hit you for about 15 damage, while Slim's attacks hit for 10 tops. Slim has
less HP and hits softer (heh!) than Fatso, plus he can use Potions to heal
themselves - so who's on the obvious list for shotoff first? After Slim is
gone, it's just a matter of few turns to take down Fatso, mainly due to his
somewhat high DEF. If you see Fatso spinning around, beware - he's about to
hit one girl for 20 damage. Even though you've just began playing, don't
relax! You can get game over if you're not careful. Don't forget to steal
their items and cash - every acc you nail ASAP is saving you from some cash
being spent.

2. Thunder - LATT VS one chr - light mgd
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
Her slap deals about 15 damage, same goes for Thunder. The game introduces
Dress Up aspect. When prompted, press L1, then select songstress job and Yuna
will transform. Now immediately select Darkness Dance from the ability list
(you *can't* select anything else no matter how hard you try) and Yuna will
bestow darkness upon LB. (BTW, only command Yuna will be able to use for the
rest of the battle is Darkness Dance). This leaves LB. with only Thunder in
her playing hand, cos her physicals will miss a lot. Meanwhile have Rikku
steal LB.'s item (she carries hefty amount of cash too) and Paine pound on her
mercilessly. Don't forget to heal if in danger zone, you need all EXP you can
get.

Place of following events is 'Celsius'. Gentlemen, Yuna is yours to command at
last! For starters check the main menu - added have been four entries: Equip,
Garment Grids, Abilities and Dresspheres.

In top left of the bridge is Buddy (talk to him to receive AL BHED PRIMER KEY
ITEM), your mission navigator, ie person you need to talk with to have world
map displayed so you can pick your destinations. In top middle Brother (Note
1) is sitting in pilot chair - when you're done chatting, you'll get 3x AL
BHED PRIMER KEY ITEM-s. At top right Rikku is extended in her chair. At middle
right you can talk to Shinra (Note 2).

To progress with the story, you must talk to Rikku, Paine, Shinra, Brother and
MN. Hm, nothing happens... how about we explore the ship? Go S and when past
the door, a handy SSP will be presented. Like in FFX, examining SSP fully
restores all HP/MP as well as remove any status changes. Continue further and
into the elevator (Note 3) and head for the engine room - here you'll find
ETHER, 4x POTION, 4x PHOENIX DOWN and 3x REMEDY.

Note 1 - When you talk to Bro, you'll be given a tutorial on Al Bhed. There's
a total of 26 Al Bhed primers you can nail throughout your adventure. Some of
them are given to you as story progresses, whilst some can only be obtained by
digging at Bikanel and obtained by completing optional story events. By
following my guide exactly as stated, you'll end up with 18 Al Bhed primers
obtained from various events and stuff - the remaining 8 you'll dig up
Bikanel.

Note 2 - Talking to Shinra will give you these options:
SHINRA'S GUIDE TO EVERYTHING - Learn the basics of the game! (Note 4)
TREASURE SPHERES             - View special movie spheres you've found.
SHINRA'S BESTIARY            - View information on enemies you've defeated.
SHINRA'S DOSSIERS            - View information on people you've encountered.

Note 3 - Depending on location from which you're entering the elevator:
DECK        - Returns you to Bridge
BRIDGE      - Deck, Cabin, Engine Room
CABIN       - Deck, Bridge, Engine Room
ENGINE ROOM - Deck, Bridge, Cabin

Note 4 - Make sure to check out 'Using Garment Grids' tutorial - after it's
done, you receive VANGUARD GG!

Return to elevator and choose third option again to be taken to ship's inn.
Talk to Hypello on the right - he offers a shop...
-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
BARKEEP'S SHOP
Potion 50               | Twist Headband (Sleepproof) 3000

...and a place to sleep for free. Buy some Potions (10) and Phoenix Downs (5
should be enough) - MAKE SURE YOU CHOOSE REST! In fact, if you want %
completion, you must rest in each of five chapters at least once! Going
upstairs in the cabin produces no effect... there aren't even any items to be
found. When done here, head back to elevator. An alarm will go off - in the
elevator choose second option to reach bridge hallway. Approach your MN and
it's time for first HS! When prompted, squeeze Yuna's pretty a... um, I mean,
push action button.

'FR - upper tier': Because you can't really do it, you'll get a nice look at
Yuna's booty instead. Awww, c'mon how much longer will you keep pulling her
up, girls? When in control, go N. Short reminder will appear about how to jump
when near 'correct' spots - by pressing X. Go right a bit any you'll see Yuna
stutter at the edge, meaning you're near one of jumping spots. What you do is
simply *hold* Circle and run to the edge - Yuna will jump over automatically.
Right after that keep Circle pressed and Yuna will climb up small ledge.
Before you jump the next gap, drop down and get YELLOW RING ACC. Then turn
around, keep Circle pressed and press left - Yuna will climb back up. Now turn
right and jump the gap to where Rikku and Paine are. Go S, down the stairs and
use SSP nearby. From this point on random battles are initiated. Make full use
of your battle knowledge and rack up some levels while you're at it. You're
about to have few shaky boss battles. From SSP head W - after the scene
examine the SSWT in the wall and pick [Start the elevator] option.

You'll land in 'FR - base (lower)'. Now change both Rikku's and Yuna's job
into warrior. Now go S and keep dropping off ledges, then make your way W
where a chest with ELIXIR awaits liberation. Return the way you came - you'll
see a part of broken pillar, so climb two ledges found here (remember to keep
Circle pressed!!!) and keep climbing until you reach rather large clearing.
Get to LV3 or LV4 before climbing too high - it will be helpful in next
battle. Prior to battle change Yuna to songstress. Try to go N...

1. Love Tap - on Fatso, Slim or her - induces haste
2. Sonic Fan - NATT VS one/two/all chrs - mgd, arc attack
3. 'Fan slap' - VS one chr - phd
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
Slim hits for 10 damage, Fatso for 20 and LB. for 15. This time I recommend
getting rid of Fatso first - if he gets hasted, you'll get pummeled even more
and we don't want that. As Yuna gets her turn, keep chanting Darkness Dance to
keep all three enemies blinded and raise your survival chances a lot. Watch
out for Fatso's spinning animation, which signifies he'll throw his shield for
big damage.

LB. has a fixed attack pattern - she goes 'fan slap', Sonic Fan, Love Tap,
repeat. This makes LB. extremely predictable and can help you coordinate your
attacks accordingly. If LB. takes strange stance and is looking in direction
of your girls, she's charging up her magic attack, which hits everybody for 10
damage. Slim still doesn't have anything special to be afraid of, but don't
forget to heal in time if you get low on HP. And nail their items too, if you
can spare some extra turns.
*****************************************************************************

------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------
OUTRUN THE LEBLANC SYNDICATE!
Beat the Syndicate to the top! But watch out! There's no telling what they'll
do to stop you.
Objective: Be the first to the top of the ruins
------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------

Yay, a timer! As the mission starts, memorize where the three stooges have
entered the building. You have six minutes to make it to the top of the
structure - for full % you must reach the top before timer runs out. Timer
only ticks as you're walking around on map screen - while in battles or main
menu, timer is stopped. When in control, go N and keep going until you reach a
chest - steal MEGA PHOENIX. Now go left a bit and step on elevation that has a
fallen 'ramp' leading somewhere up. This is a dead end, so don't go there -
instead drop off this ledge to the NW and then jump up to small catwalk, then
jump over the gap to reach the entrance to interior of the structure. You'll
have to defeat a group of weak enemies and then you're allowed to enter.

Welcome 'FR: passage'! Go N until you reach 1stcross. Go W, climb up the
ledge, examine SSWT and pick [Activate it] option. Repeat the procedure for E
end - both switches pressed will cause certain pillar to be lowered. Back at
crossroads go N and fall into the pit - nail the chest for WHITE RING ACC.
Climb back out holding S - now turn around and jump over the gap you just fell
into. You will reach 2ndcross with path branching off to the E - take it.
Follow the hallway using series of jumps and climbing until you get to the
exit - (check you location menu and it'll read 'FR: base (upper)') outside
nail the chest with RED RING ACC. Go back in 'FR: Passage', retrack to
2ndcross and this time take N path.

On next screen you again have a simple hallway with combos of jumps and climbs
- will pose no problem at all, just remember to keep Circle pressed. You're
again outside in 'FR: Base' - go S, then W following the path until you get to
fight another surprise bunch. After the battle Yuna will be standing on broken
pillar, which is crossing the chasm to another side. As you cross it, hold
Circle to jump on pile of rubble to reach 'FR: Spire'.

Kkeep climbing up until you stand on a very tight catwalk - here waltz to the
right until you reach another chest with STAR PENDANT ACC. Loot it, then
backtrack a bit and continue your climb. If you were faster than three
stooges, you'll see sth funny. Can I touch that too? Here's another SSP, so
save your progress. LV5 is recommended to have right now to ensure easy life
VS next boss. Climb up even more (getting tired of it), nail the chest with
MUSCLE BELT ACC (only if you were faster than three stooges!), then walk bit
right and up the stairs. Were three stooges successful in making it to the top
before you did, they will make their escape about... NOW!

   attack
4. [Tempus Laxit] - VS all chrs - phd, induces stop, arc attack
5. [Power Catalyst] - on self - the longer the battle, the higher the STR
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
First boss of the game that is even remotely challenging... but not by much.
Both boss' PATK hit one girl for about 45, while Sticky End hits all girls for
50 damage. Boris has a fixed attack pattern and here it is - four turns of
either 'double swipe' or 'chew', with Sticky End following each fifth Boris'
turn. You will know when boss is about to use Sticky End when it takes an
ominous battle stance.

Beware! Sticky End can induce stop, making your girls immobile - luckily it
has low chance of connecting. Should stop occur anyway, heal the status with
Remedies you've picked up in Celsius. If even this isn't an option, you must
wait for stop to wear off. To soften up Boris, use warrior's Armor and Power
Break abilities on it to reduce damage it can give *and* increase damage you
can give.

When you're in subsequent plays and if you're lucky enough to come across
Boris when it oversouls, you may have a problem. Or not, since you'll be
keeping stuff you've already gained in previous plays. Anyway - Boris will
begin by using Power Catalyst on itself, and then releasing Tempus Laxit. All
girls will suffer phd and be put under stop status. Have Dragonfly Orbs or
Kinesis Badges to be immune (thief DSP helps too). If girls are affected,
nothing you can do about it - just wait for stop to wear off. Don't take too
long in nailing Boris or its power (thanks to Power Catalyst) will grow at
steady rate. Applying protect will be very helpful as well. In short, OSF
Boris isn't so hard, provided you have decent DEF and can guard against stop.
* - AFTER the battle you'll also receive Faerie Earrings.
*****************************************************************************

GAGAZET SPHERE KEY ITEM now belongs to you. Head back outside and you're back
onboard 'Celsius - Bridge'. You'll see Bro lying on the floor. Talk to him and
pick [Comfort him] option, then talk to Shinra - BLACK MAGE DSP is yours.

With this Storyline Mission 2 has come to an end. And first opportunity of

Now that you have control of actually choosing your destination, let's take a

possible destinations:

Storyline m.     - Triggers next storyline mission and advances the story. Be
                   advised that you cannot return to airship during some of
                   such missions.
Sidequest No.    - Denotes sidequest is available in target area.
                   [...] parenthesis denote that sidequest is 'hidden', ie
                   you can't see it on NavMap screen. You need to beam down
                   to target area and find the trigger which allows you to
                   start the mission.
Treasure         - Visit the area and free the contents of all chests.*
Scene            - Area worth visiting for few extra scenes.
PR Mission       - Most extensive sidequest IMO. Triggered in CH1 and lasts
                   whole game. Simply play minigames and lose credits.
Bride Mission    - Another extensive sidequest. Not worth your time IMO.

*   - Even though not indicated, all of the 15 areas you can visit contain
      treasure chests that can be looted.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I will be making sections like these if after completing storyline mission a
player is given choice of picking other destinations. Confusing? Here's what I
mean... Remember after you finished first storyline mission in Luca and how
you were immediately thrown into second on top of Gagazet? You weren't able to
choose any other destinations but Gagazet.

This is different now. When you talk to MN and enter the map of Spira, you
have the choice of going to every destination you desire. To get the full
experience and enjoyment out of FFX-2, I recommend visiting every location
after every storyline mission to view everything there is to see. Don't wanna
do that? Fret not, this is where I come in.

Use the chart above to help you decide where you want to go. Want to complete
every single sidequest there is to be offered before moving on with the story?
Throw a quick look in the chart - areas where sidequests are available for
completing will have the nice mark of 'Sidequest No.' next to it. In short,
every area is worth revisiting at least once per chapter, as treasure chests
are 'lurking' around to be robbed.

On 'K. dock' aside from looting chests (contain ETHER, MANA TABLET, 2x
ANTIDOTE, 2x EYE DROPS and PHOENIX DOWN), there are two points of interest you
can examine. In lower right of this section you'll find a woman with two kids
and monkey-like critter near her. Talk to her and you will be given a
miniquest of getting Squatter Monkeys in Kilika woods (you can't enter the
woods yet, so you will have to leave this for later). Then there's a shop you
in NW corner with following goods...

Now enter N part of Kilika, called 'K - res. area'. On this screen climb
nearby stairs, then go left. You've just found Dona's house. Heheh - enter the
house after he runs off. Have a talk with Dona (at the top of her house you'll
find 1500 GIL), then explore the rest of Kilika (and relieve the chests of
LUNAR CURTAIN, 2x HOLY WATER, STAR CURTAIN, LIGHT CURTAIN). Then there's a
huge boat in SE corner of the screen. Get aboard and you'll find a man with a
camera on the boat. Talk to him and choose [Okay, thanks!] option. Note that
you cannot pass the N-most gates yet.

Okay, this quest is available as soon as you obtain black mage DSP. Alarm will
sound off, indicating two new HS. But who cares about that? It's time to laugh
a little. Choose Luca as your destination (also, it doesn't matter how you
enter)... soooo, what really went on behind the scenes prior to the concert
you saw in beginning?

------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------
BEHIND THE SCENES
Retrace Yuna's steps during her impostor's concert in Luca. The truth is out
there. Find it!
Objective: Learn the whole story behind the concert
------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------

I laughed my ass off when I saw Yuna in her outfit. After the sequence you'll
be at 'L - outskirts', so go to 'L - square'. After another scene some guy
will yell at Yuna (note that you can't go upstairs anymore!). From your
current position go *down* and you'll find him sitting on the ground (under
the flag) next to the store that sells balloons. Your job is to deliver 10
balloons to 10 people. Not a tough objective at all.

Not counting the kid running around with red balloon, there's eight other
people also located on this screen - give a balloon to each of them and your
stock is decreased to mere 2 balloons (you need to open a window for last
two). Here are their locations:
- woman shaking her booty near the cart where you got balloons
- kid in front of the statue
- *two* people sitting on the bench adjacent to W side of the status
- old woman sitting on the bench at W side of 'L - square'
- man standing at extreme N of 'L - square'
- two people sitting on the ground in NW corner of 'L - square'
- there's a house with two monitors near two sitting people; approach the
  glass beneath it and press X - there's two last people

MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! You also receive HEALING WIND GG!

Still, there's more left to in Luca. When you beam down to Luca, you'll appear
in 'Outskirts'. Nail the chest with 2x LUNAR CURTAIN by jumping to it, then go
to 'Square'. Go for 'T - reception' - here you can buy music spheres (1000 gil
for one) and movie spheres (2000 gil per one). Third option lets you enter the
sphere theater, where you can view or listen to spheres you bought so far.

Visit 'Luca - dock 5' and check out the extreme end of the dock for a chest
containing THUNDER SPAWN GG.

Now go to 'Basement A' and find Rin here - you'll obtain AL BHED PRIMER KEY
ITEM. If you tried entering Basement B, shorty would forbid you from entering
- but not anymore. Even more, he'll be nice enough to explain about Sphere
Break. Choosing fourth option will pit you in a duel of Sphere Break and you
will get 5x HELM COIN, 5x ZURVAN COIN, 5x COYOTE COIN, 5x FLAN COIN. Before
you begin, you will be presented to more options - choose bottom one to leave
or any of above for some explanation on various features. Okies, that covers
this area.

As you enter the area (doesn't matter how), Yuna will make some comments about
the past. There's a large area to explore here. You might as well use the
opportunity to gain few levels and expand your item collection - use the item
checklist just a bit above to get all items (for the record, all of them are
found in chests!). Addressing girls dressed in grey clothes allows you to
cover huge parts of Mi'ihen road against a small fee. There's three of them -
one at 'MH - S end', one at 'MH - agency, front' (there's a shop here - see

* - While you're navigating 'M - ravine path', look for some rocks which serve
as a drop off base to reach 'M - ravine'.
** - Den of Woe is currently off limits. Only way to enter this dungeon is by
collecting 10 Crimson Spheres, which spans over all five story chapters.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ITEMS
- Mushroom r.: 1000 gil
- M - ravine 1: Turbo Ether, Phoenix Down, Hi-Potion
- M - ravine 2: Crimson Sphere 9
- M - HQ lift: Glass Buckle, Heart of Flame GG, Favorite Outfit
- Youth HQ: Restless Sleep GG
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENEMIES: Red Elemental, Coyote, Bully Cap, Tonberry
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Doesn't matter how you enter - enter 'Mushroom r.'. Ahead you'll see two goons
from not long before. Go after them and a scene follows, where you're stopped
by a group of soldiers - choose [You're Yaibal, of the Youth League.], then
[Sure, we're game.]. Then follow Paine and Rikku to next area, but before you
leave this screen, make sure to talk to Clasko to win extra %! DO NOT TURN
YAIBAL DOWN when he asks you if you wanna take the job! If you do, your 100%
completion went down the drain. If by any weird decision you do turn Yaibal
down for now, he'll ask Clasko to show you the way to Djose road - talking to
Clasko will award some %, but still this won't allow you to get 100%. If you
wish to nab 1000 GIL, explore the N part of 'Mushroom r.' to find a lift,
which can be activated by X, thus reaching the chest with cash inside.

------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------
FOGGY FIEND FRENZY!
The Youth League is a bit shorthanded. Help them out by clearing out the
fiends along Mushroom rock road! Fiends will attack more often under cover of
fog. Proceed with caution!
Objective: Reach the lift leading to headquarters
------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------

You'll start at 'M - ravine path'. Your objective is simple - get to the other
end of the path, kill anything that tries to get in your way and reach the
elevator to Youth League base. Stand on elevator and press X to rise. Quite
soon you'll spot... em, henchmen from before, who will try to escape by
jumping down in 'M - ravine'. Follow them all the way N (on your way you can
score TURBO ETHER, PHOENIX DOWN and HI-POTION) until you reach SSP. Very close
to it is an entrance to 'M - ravine 2' - after scene is over, CRIMSON SPHERE 9
KEY ITEM is yours (make sure you watch it as soon as you're aboard Celsius!) -
before you turn around, make sure to examine the weird door.

Turn around and... surprise! Choose [Of course I do!]. After Maroda finishes
blabbing, go back to the point of 'M - ravine path' where you jumped down.
When you climb back up, continue your journey N. Be careful if you encounter
any Tonberries - prolly you're way underpowered to take it on, so escaping
might be your best option for now. When you reach another elevator, press X
again to activate it as well. On 'M - HQ lift' tag along E a bit more and soon
you'll be greeted by Elma - girls receive GLASS BUCKLE ACC and HEART OF FLAME
GG, as well as deserved MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!

There's more! Go down from your position and get FAVORITE OUTFIT ACC. Now
stand on huge elevator and press X again to rise up - then go S to reach 'M -
plateau' and even further N to reach 'Youth HQ'. Look at the minimap and
you'll spot a tight path on E side of it - jump down there to get RESTLESS
SLEEP GG! Now proceed all the way N and captain of Chocobo Knights trio
presents herself. Talk to Lucil for second time... the old chatterbox geezer
will approach after Yuna finishes talking with Lucil for second time. Wait for
him to sit down and talk to him - choose [By all means.]. Blah, blah, blah...
*puts a bullet between his eyes and makes him five-eyes*... Whatever you do,
let him finish! NEVER interrupt his blabbering, just let him talk. Put down
your controller and go do something else for about five minutes before you
return. Eventually he'll ask to shake Yuna's hand - choose [Of course.].

After all this babbling return all the way to 'Mushroom' - find Clasko who's
situated somewhere around here (he is to the right of SSP). Talk to him and
choose [The more, the merrier!] and he will now board Celsius - you need to do
that for one of later missions. Back on board of 'C - bridge' talk to Shinra
and choose to view Crimson Report (this is in fact Crimson Sphere 9). Also
drop by Cabin and talk to Clasko.

Doesn't matter how you enter - enter 'D temple' (there's PHOENIX DOWN to be
scored on W end) and position Yuna at the end of the line of people you'll see
in front of tent on the right (actually, you don't even need to do that - just
standing still anywhere is fine too). When the man in grey robe goes in, enter
'D - reception'. Talk to the person in the middle of the room, choose [I want
to dig!]. Back outside try approaching the entrance to temple - two guys will
move aside, so enter 'Great hall'. AL BHED PRIMER KEY ITEM is yours to grab.
Enter 'Living q. 1' and get ECHO SCREEN in the chest.

Now go back outside to 'D - p. road'. Choose [We're sure.] when given choice
and you'll get LETTER OF INTRODUCTION KEY ITEM (this causes HS in Bikanel to
appear). Don't forget to nail 2x POTION on this screen as well! In case you
want to have some fun on 'D highroad', note that there is a service of quickly
being transported from one end to the other.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use the airship to beam down to Moonflow! After initial scene you have several
options at your disposal. CHOOSE CAREFULLY!
- If you want Enterprise (Break HP Limit AAB), you must skip this mission. In
  the end this means no mascot for you (Gun mage can still be won in CH2).
  Beware, you won't be able to get 100% completion that way.
- If you want Minerva's Plate (reduces STR by -80, doubles MAX MP and gives
  +100 to MAG, Turbo Black Magic, but always pointless status), then you
  MUSTN'T talk to Tobli! You must also ensure that all five bags are safe!
  Both gun mage and mascot can be won in the end. Beware, you won't be able to
  get 100% completion that way.
- If you want Key to Success, you can either do this mission or skip it. You
  will get gun mage, but not mascot. 100% in one game is impossible, too.
- If you want neither of above three acc, complete this mission perfectly.
  Gun mage, mascot and 100% completion are possible.

Talk to red midget you'll see running about on 'M - S bank'... - whats's that
shining in his arms? When done talking, you should proceed to 'M - S bank
road'. Keep going S until you see someone yelling for help. You'll spot lonely
Hypello together with chocobo pulling a cart. Talk to Hypello to start the
mission.

In the event that you're walking to Moonflow from Djose area, you'll run into
that Hypello first, who'll be yelling for help. DO NOT talk to him, instead
proceed forward to Moonflow river - here talk to red midget to get the % you
need for 100%.

------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------
SHAVE THE HYPELLO?
If bandits grab the cargo, chase them down and take it back! You'll lose the
cargo if they get away.
Objective: Escort the wagon and its cargo safely to the Moonflow
------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------

Your objective is to protect the cart from several thieves that will try to
steal its contents. During the trip a total of five thieves will attempt to
rob the cart - coming in waves of 1, 2 and 2. If thieves manage to snatch one
package (there's five of them total boarded on the cart), all is not lost -
pursue the thieves and kill them to get the goods back. Simply killing them
will make stolen package magically appear back on cart.

Alrighty, mission has started. Go in front of the cart and start heading NE in
direction of Moonflow. A scene occurs... nothing you can do about getting
first package stolen. Thieves will attempt to escape SW, so make pursuit. This
is important - when you catch up to them, *you must press X button*. This will
stop them in their tracks and initiate a battle. Kill them all, then return to
the cart. Go ahead of it to make it move again. Soon another scene ensues -
this thime two groups of thieves try their luck. Unlike before, it is possible
to dispatch both groups before they even get to the cart. Remember to press X
to start the battle when close to them!

When you get to part of road with big tree on the left, cart will stop. Make
few steps forward to have the cart appear further ahead on the road. Cart will
keep going by itself, so just look out that you keep up with it. Last two
groups of thieves will appear - one from front, one from behind. Dispatch the
ones from front straight away, then turn around immediately and pursue the
other group, who most likely will manage to grab a package. Few more steps S
and you've reached Moonflow. As a sign of gratitude red midget hands over GUN
MAGE DSP, CIRCLET ACC and HELIOS GUARD GG. MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! Keep around
or return to Celsius, your choice.

Doesn't matter how you enter - as you enter the area labeled 'MW - South',
you'll see Bayra blabber about Macarena woods dying. After the scene go E from
the SSP to 'MW - To Bevelle' and past Bevelle guards to 'MW - to Calm'. On
this screen go S to 'MW - spring 1'. Talk to fat musician Donga here. Return
to 'MW - south' and take the shiny path until you come to 'MW - lake road'.
Now take SW exit to 'MW - north 1' and walk along the path until you spot
Pukutak, the third musician you need to address.

Return to 'MW - lake road' and take NE exit to 'MW - spring 2' - on this
screen seek out a man wearing pink-green coat. This is Tromell. Talk to him
four times total and he hands over FULL THROTTLE SDSP as well as UNERRING PATH
GG. Quick instructions on how to use SDSP will follow.

Back to 'MW - lake road' and take NW exit to 'MW - agency, f' for a scene,
after which you receive AL BHED PRIMER KEY ITEM. O'aka, seeing that (you can
talk to him, if your reactions are fast enough; if you fail, fret not, it does
not affect %), will flee back into the forest. Next to the house is a chest
with HI-POTION. Turn around, follow O'aka and mission starts.

------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------
FOLLOW THAT O'AKA!
O'aka is on the run from debt collectors. Go hunt him down, but stay on your
toes! He's faster than the average merchant.
Objective: Find O'aka and corner him
------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------

From 'MW - agency, f' take SW exit to reach 'MW - north 1'. Follow the path
until you get to the section where rather big tree is covering part of path.
O'aka is behind it, so when you're near the tree, press X to have him escape
ahead to 'MW - central 1'. He'll be in plain sight here, but still trying to
elude Yuna to prevent her from catching up with him. Progress on to the next
screen (on the way loot the chest for WHITE RING ACC). Keep going until you
reach 'MW - south'. You may consider saving your game now. On this screen go E
to reach 'MW - to Bevelle' - here ignore the guards and press on further E.
'MW - to Calm' screen has another multiple exits - take N one for 'MW -
campsite'. Now talk to both Rikku and Paine to get a vague idea of where O'aka
is hiding. Examine NW corner - after the scene talk to O'aka and choose [Let's
hide him on the airship!] to get ICE QUEEN GG. MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!

What's in it for you if you let O'aka aboard the ship? He's located in 'C -
cabin'. When you talk to him, you'll notice a gil amount in upper right -
that's O'aka's debt. In first game the debt consists of 100000 gil. If you
don't clear whole amount by the end of CH2, the amount you did clear off
carries on to next playthru, but you receive a penalty of 1000 gil, which is
added to O'aka's debt.

O'aka doesn't sell anything hot, but that's not the point. Reduce his debt all
the way down by buying stuff from him - when you do that, his prices will be
reduced big-time! Hi-Potion will be sold for measly 50 gil as opposed to 500.
You can also rack up easy gil by buying Hi-Potions from O'aka and then selling
them to Hypello nearby. That way you can slowly, but surely increase your gil.
In any case, make sure you reduce his debt by the end of CH2!

In the event you've decided to turn O'aka over to Al Bhed, all is not lost.
You still receive Ice Queen GG, but O'aka disappears until CH3, when there's
an event in Bikanel where you can find him again. More details on this case
can be found in CH3 part of the walkthru.

Finally, you can learn a great blue bullet skill in this area - inflict
confusion on Haizhe with Full Throttle's Crazy Wing ability and it may use
Mighty Guard on your party of gun mages.

When you enter the area for the first time, you're bound to get that deja-vu
feeling... where to go? Just follow Rikku... You will fall into few battles
(not even No Encounters AAB prevents them) before three girls pass out. You'll
soon find yourself in Al Bhed camp as well as receive AL BHED PRIMER KEY ITEM.
There's no way to leave but using SSP to beam aboard 'Celsius'. There's a
locked chest 'guarded' by a fat guy - this chest can only be opened in CH5, if
you're in possession of Desert Key. Person next to SSP sells stuff, so restock
if you need.

If you're in possession of Letter of Introduction, you can now trigger a scene
in upper-right corner. After that find two male Al Bheds that are 'talking' to
each other, talk to them both and then address them again. You'll see another
scene, where Nhadala will come flying on some machine. She's now pacing back
and forth on right of the screen. Talk to her and choose [I've got this
letter...] to start the mission.

------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------
CAN YOU DIG IT?
Dig up the machina parts that Nhadala asked you to find in the desert and
transport them safely to camp.
Objective: Dig up and deliver the needed parts
------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------

Talk to pilot now and choose [Western Expanse]. You'll be introduced to
Picket, who will be your faithful partner during your digs. In a nutshell, you
have one minute to excavate an item marked by a yellow cross, which will
appear on your mini map. Really easy, believe you me. All you have to do is to
move Yuna to yellow cross and she will excavate the item hidden beneath
automatically. Digging up at white crosses will usually award you with some
gil, items or even enemies to fight.

You're not alone in your digging attempts - there is one other digger that
will try to beat you to buried treasure, so you need to move fast. As soon as
you've found what you're looking for, head back to the hover before the time
limit reaches zero. Picket will also warn you if you go too far away from the
hover.

When you find yellow cross item, return to the hover which brought you here
and you'll automatically return to 'BD - west 1'. You're rewarded with ELIXIR
and STILL OF NIGHT GG, as well as receive MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! You may now
indulge in digging minigame, scoring primers, items, coins etc. You know a
strange machine (back in Djose temple, in one of side rooms) that you examine
and ask for a raise? NGCKE comments that you must dig three times minimum
before you can try asking for raise again.

BTW, if you run into an enemy with super high HP, don't be alarmed. It'll
eject you from battle after few turns have passed - this *isn't* game over!

IMPORTANT!!! If you want to get both GG from doing Publicity campaign, I highly
advise you gain at least 400+ points for both companies *before* CH5. If you're 
going to collect PR points in CH5 as well, choose well which company will you
advertise for in CH3.

Doesn't matter how you enter - first point of interest are three hovers
scattered throughout the area. One is located in SW part of Calm lands (Note
1), second can be found in N part (Note 2) and third one in NE part (Note 3).
Left person standing in front of the hover is from Open Air company, while the
right person represents Argent company. Here's a breakdown on their offers and
stuffs before you start doing anything with their publicity campaign.

Note 1 - features Lupine Dash minigame

LEFT PERSON                           | RIGHT PERSON
Play Lupine Dash                      | Play Lupine Dash

Never mind.                           | Never mind.

First and second choice for both lists are pretty self-explanatory, right?
Third one allows you to buy credits in ratio 10 gil for 1 credit. Fourth
option lets you exchange credits for available prizes (see Note 4 below).
Fifth option lets you ride the hover to various parts of Calm lands for 10
credits (you can choose to be transported to: either of two other minigames,
Rin agency, entrance to Macalania or entrance to Gagazet). Sixth option lets
you choose whether or not you wish to undertake the Publicity mission
(explained in later updates). If you wish to get Episode Complete for this
area in CH5 and mascot DSP, UNDERTAKE PUBLICITY MISSION NOW! Seventh option
cancels the menu altogether.

Note 2 - features Sky Slots minigame

Note 4 - So, you're wondering what these suckers are selling initially?

LEFT PERSON                           | RIGHT PERSON
Potion 10                             | Potion 10
Phoenix Down 30                       | Phoenix Down 30
Budget Grenade 50                     | Budget Grenade 50
Hi-Potion 150                         | Hi-Potion 150
Charm Bangle 500                      | Ether 500

Visit N part of Calm lands and seek the hover found here. Talk to the
representative of Open Air and select to trade in 5000 gil for 500 credits.
With those credits buy Charm Bangle acc - with this equipped you eliminate any
and all random encounters (except event battles).

What used to be a Monster Arena two years ago (take E exit from Calm lands),
is now given a completely different purpose. Unfortunately you can't enter it
yet nor can do anything about it - you must wait until CH2. Then there's the
cave of smelly faith, which you also can't enter at this point. Need to wait,
you must.

Thirdly, visit Rin agency in the middle of Calm Lands.
-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
CALM LANDS - RIN AGENCY SHOP
Potion 50               | Iron Bangle (HP+20%) 500
Phoenix Down 100        | Silver Bracer (MP+40%) 500
Antidote 50             | Wristband (STR+10) 1000
Eye Drops 50            | Amulet (MAG+10) 1000
Echo Screen 50          |
Soft 50                 |
Holy Water 300          |
-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

Talk to the guy behind the counter to the right of SSP. Another guy sitting
down can be seen - apparently he's waiting for someone to be his... bride?
Choose first option twice to initiate this sidequest mission. Like Publicity
mission, it spans over more CH-s. And unlike Publicity mission, bridal mission
isn't needed for % completion or getting Episode complete. Also I'd advise not
to bother with bridal mission - all you get in the end is Elixir or Speed
Bracer.

Once you have used the hover services ten times, you'll be awarded with CALM
LANDS DISCOUNT PASS KEY ITEM, which reduces the price from 10 to 5 credits per
hovertrip.

Finally, you can learn a great blue bullet skill in this area - inflict
confusion on Coeurl with Full Throttle's Crazy Wing ability and it may use
White Wind on your party of gun mages.

Doesn't matter how you enter - here you will meet Kimahri. During the scene
pick [We'll take care of Lian and Ayde.]. Don't choose anything else but this.
After scene is finished, talk to everyone, including Kimahri (you have to
address him twice) on 'G - mountain gate' screen and pick following responses:
- [You have to learn to deal with these things!] - pick this!!!
- [I will never forget their sacrifice.]
- [Leave it to the Gullwings!]
- [I wouldn't forgive them either.]
- [I can imagine how you must feel...]
- [I'm sure you're right.]
- [A change for the better, I hope.] - this guy is in 'G - mountain c1'

I'm sure the lot of you are now confused at why should you choose these and
not others. Let me list the reasons which will make you *want* these: in CH3
you'll be awarded trainer DSP if Kimahri's self-esteem is high. Additionally,
these choices affect certain boss battle in CH3. And lastly, Ronsos will build
something for Yuna in CH5.

Have Kimahri's self-esteem and Ronso's trust too low? No trainer DSP for you,
boss battle will be harder and Yuna won't get the thing in CH5 as well.

Now let's explore this huge mountain. Behind Kimahri you'll spot a teleporter
with following destinations: 'Mountain Trail', 'Fayth Scar 1' and 'Summit'.
Choose whatever you wish, or go for some climbing if you want EXP, cash and
items (but none that can be found in treasure chests).

We have 2 HS, but I find Besaid destination easier, so let's clear that one
first, shall we? Enter Besaid! After the scene you'll want to do some
exploring. Enter 'B - shop' first, talk to female shopkeeper and pick first
option for the wares...
-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
BESAID SHOP
Potion 50               | Watery Gleam (Waterstrike) 3000
Phoenix Down 100        | Blue Ring (Water Ward, Water ACTA) 3000

Holy Water 300          |
-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

Choosing [Any rare finds?] will make her offer you something for 900000 gil.
Woooooot? Anyway, if you've paid off O'aka's debt already (please refer to
section 21 in this guide), I'm sure you have large amounts of cash, so buying
this shouldn't be a problem, eh? You receive BESAID KEY KEY ITEM. This key
item unlocks the chest found in 'B - monks' chamber'. Use it to receive SEARCH
SPHERE. Search Sphere only works on this island. If you leave it, you'll have
to return to same room and regain Search Sphere if you wish to use it again.
If shopkeeper says the key has been sold to the traveler (in which case you
may opt to get it for free during a subquest in Calm lands in CH3), you may
want to reload the game and inquire about the key again. If luck is on your
side, key will be offered for buying again (submitted by Kathi P.).

Enter middle house on the right - inside you'll find female bustier of first
posse. After long chat follow Lu back into Wakka's house. Talk to her and
choose [Yes, I'd love to.] - when you wake up, Lu will be outside. Get out of
Wakka's house and again talk with Lu and pick [We're on the case!].

------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------
WHERE'S WAKKA?
Wakka sure is acting weird. And now he's gone off to some cave? Gather clues
from the villagers and track him down! Maybe you'll find treasure along the
way...
Objective: Find Wakka, and maybe something else...
------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------

You'll need to look for four clues scattered across Besaid - all clues
together give password to unlock a certain door. You're supposed to talk to
people to learn about hints, but why bother? All four ciphers will be marked
in your minimap, sa save yourself the trouble and get out of the village.

FIRST FOUR-CIPHER-SET

Get out of Besaid, and walk up the slope until you reach 'B - promontory'.
Notice red shape in your minimap? Examine it to learn first cipher. From here
go to 'B - ancient r.' - stand close to right pillar and press Circle to climb
onto it. Up there mash X to learn fourth cipher. Get down, then proceed N
again to 'B - waterfall way 1'. Just as you're about to reach first bridge, go
to the left of it and fall down - get 2x CHOCOBO WING. Climb back up, then
proceed going E to reach 'B - crossroads'. Here you will find password sealed
door. You need to input four-digit number to unlock the door - we found two
already, but need to locate two more, so head for 'B - beach'. Immediately as
you enter, press left - you'll see a person standing on a cliff. Hold Circle
and you'll climb the cliff - continue climbing to red sign on minimap for your
third cipher. Don't return yet! Continue along and after some jumping you'll
reach secluded beach with two chests containing HI-POTION and 1000 GIL. Now
return all the way back and check out the other end of the beach. You'll
notice final red symbol on the minimap - with help of Circle button you'll
learn third cipher. BTW, password is changed with each playthru, so I can't
help you if you're looking just for the number. Back to password door, where
you should punch in the number in order for door to open. Access granted!

SECOND FOUR-CIPHER-SET

Now let's take care of opening the second password protected door you found
(or will find) in 'B - cave'. The four ciphers used for this door are
DIFFERENT than ones you used to enter the cave initially. Remember that if you
leave the island, you have to go get Search Sphere again from 'B - nuns'
chambers'. Reward may not be great, but I assure you that being able to cast
Confuse on the enemies leads to some awesome results, which I'll be frequently
exploiting during this guide. Of course, if you don't wish to be bothered
doing this now, you're perfectly welcome to try gaining cash and GG in later
CH-s.

When you exit the temple, you'll notice a blue orb in lower right of the
screen. Press and hold Circle when walking around - a blue bar will eject from
blue orb. Use the blue orb in combination with blue bar to find four special
spheres scattered across Besaid. When you're fairly close to the sphere, the
blue bar will start 'pulsating' - closer you are, harder the pulse. When
you're almost on top of the sphere, blue bar will flash red. Now press X and
Yuna will dig out the special sphere. Stand on top of it and press X yet again
to enter camera view (directionals move camera around, R1 zooms in thrice and
then resets, while Square leaves this screen).

1st commSphere: Enter the path between 'B - shop' and 'B - lodge'. Path
appears greyed out on minimap. Press and hold X to dig out the sphere buried
here (in the ruined structure). Use the sphere and direct it toward the roof
of Besaid temple. Above the entrance you'll spot a green ball with a number
written on it. Mark it down.

2nd commSphere: Enter 'B - village slope'. Take a look at the minimap, as my
directions for this sphere will be based on it! Sphere is hidden in the ground
to the S of SSP. Stand on newly uncovered sphere, and direct the sphere to
upper left of the screen. You'll see the green ball with second number above a
bunch of trees.

3rd commSphere: This one will require a bit of searching on your part. You
know 'B - waterfall way 1'? Stand at the first bridge and turn SW (according
to minimap directions). Now slowly start walking to SW and count the poles on
Yuna's right. When you come to 12th pole, start digging! Sphere is hidden
somewhere around there. When you uncover it, direct the view just below right
waterfall - green ball hiding third number is there.

4th commSphere: Enter 'B - valley' screen and go NE (according to minimap yet
again) as far as you can and press X to uncover final sphere. Direct the view
a bit to the right. Now pay attention - in the distance you'll see small
lonely palm tree. Zoom in thrice and you'll spot the green ball right away.
Mark down final number.

Now that you have all the numbers, head to 'B - cave'. As soon as you enter,
turn right at 1stcross, examine the SSWT, punch in the code and enter new part
of dungeon. Collect ETHER along the way. At the end you'll find Yuna to be
above the waterfalls - hike left as far as you can and nail the chest, which
contains RAGING GIANT GG.

CONTINUING THE STORYLINE MISSION...

Inside 'B - cave' you'll find Wakka - approach him to trigger a sequence.
After the scene go W and follow the corridor until another scene occurs (in
case you still didn't progress past eastern wall, do so now). At 2ndcross go
SW to reach a chest, which should be looted. Return to 2ndcross and continue N
by jumping over few gaps - this will be followed by small end stretch on which
you can find SSP and another special sphere. Be at Lv7 or higher now. Once you
approach that sphere and press X...

4. [Bruiser Tail] - FRATTP VS all chrs - fractional phd, tears off 37,5% MAX
   HP, delays hit girls' next turn, arc attack
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
If you've been fluently attempting sidequests, here's the ultimate setup:
Heart of Flame GG (complete Foggy Fiend Frenzy! quest), Icy Gleam acc (from a
chest in Macalania woods) and using warrior's Sentinel.

Flame Dragon will open this battle by using Flame Breath on your party, which
hits all for 200 damage (absorb damage with Heart of Flame or halve it by Red
Ring acc). Its 'swipe' hits for 50 damage. To start the battle in your favor,
square off by using Power and Magic Break of warrior job, followed by ice
element PATK. Using regular PATK will take too long.

I've noticed something that can further tip odds in your favor - boss' swipe
is used against the girl with highest current HP. So if you keep one girl's HP
as high as possible, it will be only her that will suffer from attacks.
Additionally, change her into warrior and have her execute Sentinel at all
times to be taking 1 damage from each 'swipe'. However, be on your toes before
the end of battle - when boss loses hass 99 or less HP remaining, it'll charge
up its Flame Breath once again. Heal in time... but this is obviously not
needed if you're equipped with Heart of Flame GG.

Battling Flame Dragon becomes more interesting in its OSF - it will start the
battle by charging a turn for Bruiser Tail. Use the time you're given to
attack it mercilessly - leave no space for being slow. Bruiser belongs to type
of attacks you'll be hating in this game - it deals fractional damage, ie
damage based on current or MAX HP, in this case MAX HP. Luckily you can reduce
it with protect, but be advised - it won't always be so. Take note to heal
regularly if Flame Dragon frequently tosses Bruisers your way. You can help
yourself by inducing darkness on it, thus reducing the chances for it to hit
you. As for Flame Breath in OSF form - it is used irregularly and there's no
way to predict it.
*****************************************************************************

After defeating Flame Dragon you obtain WHITE MAGE DSP. Head back to the
entrance of this cave and approach Wakka to trigger a scene. BESAID SPHERE KEY
ITEM is yours, as well as PROTECTION HALO GG.

With this Storyline Mission 3 has come to an end.

Back on board of 'Celsius' check your main menu - final entry White Magic has
been added. Switch one of the gals to white mage and have her learn curative
magic which will prove mightily useful in upcoming boss battles - unlike FFX,
you can cast Cure, Cura and Curaga on everybody at once! Okay, one more HS is
left, this one being Zanarkand. Beam her up, Scotty! When you appear, mission
will start automatically...

------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------
CLAIM THE TREASURE SPHERE!
Treasure sphere waves have been traced to the Zanarkand Ruins, once holy
ground. Don't be the last sphere hunters to claim the prize!
Objective: Acquire the treasure sphere
------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------

...so just stroll N. You will be denied access further by some girl, so what
do you do? Go up the slope on your right and as far N as you can... if you
played FFX, a familiar figure stands up here. During the convo a choice
presents itself - choose [Of course I remember!]. After the convo go down the
slope and leave this screen by going NW.

On 'Z - dome 1' simply go N - you'll view a scene on 'Z - dome 2'. Where three
kids have had their first conversation, you'll find a woman selling stuff on
the left of the screen...

-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

...so stock up on Potions, Phoenix Downs and status curing items (or in case
you've done O'aka debt lowerage, you already have all Hi-Potions you need).
After stocking proceed N to 'Dome - interior'. Another scene, after which you
should follow the path which winds N... After seeing another scene with kids
(make sure you pick [Sure I do!]) proceed further - you'll run into one of the
goons, who will initiate an easy fight. After the fight proceed further and
you'll reach 1stcross - take rightmost branch for a chest with MEGA PHOENIX,
then backtrack a bit and continue N. On your way you'll initiate next fight
(doesn't matter what choice you pick), loot another chest for PHOENIX DOWN and
engage into another fight until you finally reach 'Dome - corridor'.

This screen is loaded with people and chests, which have already been looted.
Don't examine small critters too often, as some steal gil from you (well, it's
only like 2 or 3 gil at the most). Up the stairs and into 'Dome - cloister 1'
we goooo! Go thru doors in upper left corner to 'Dome - cloister 2' and then
go left - a scene will occur. Now you need to use the lift in the middle of
the room to be taken down to 'Dome - chamber'. Use SSP found below, then
proceed NW - you'll find Yuna's uncle in the next room, so talk to him (if you
choose [Not really.] when prompted, this will cause Cid NOT to appear in
Thunder plains in CH2, but rather in CH3; choosing [You bet I do!] option will
trigger Cid to appear in Thunder plains in CH2, and CH3 as well (you'll have
to talk to him at both occassions); CHOOSE [You bet I do!]!!!). Now talk to
the chubby guy as well - doing this will grant access to 'Dome - great hall'.
Loot 6 chests for REMEDY, 2x REMEDY, ETHER, ELIXIR, HI-POTION and PHOENIX
DOWN. Go N to 'Dome - the beyond'...

After a scene go up and another scene will occur. When given choice, pick
second option (if playing japanese version) or fifth option (if playing US
version), which is [Is that you, Isaaru?] - this will grant you HEART REBORN
GG. When blahblah has settled down, use the stairs leading down on N-most end
of the room to reach 'Dome - treasure c.'. What do you know, a dungeon.
Beware, Behemoths lurk around here. It's a simple tunnel with lots of jumping
and climbing... nothing you haven't encountered before. When you see a square
shaped room on your minimap, get ready! Turn Yuna into white mage (make sure
she has learned Cura) and reach LV9 with your girls.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
Here's the recommended setup for this fight: Mythril Gloves acc (buy in
Zanarkand shop), any type of acc that grants elemental strike properties,
Helios Guard GG - pass thru red gate to obtain Auto-Protect, Raging Giant GG -
pass thru yellow and blue gates to obtain Berserktouch - then inflict berserk
on Guardian Beast to never see Curse and Damocles Photon. But do note that it
is quite resistant to berserk; if you have thief with mastered Soul Swipe, use
it instead. It works like a charm.

One of greatest nightmares makes its return. Fortunately, it's way easier than
it was in first release. It's very predictable *and* it has an attack pattern
it strictly follows as well. Its swipe gets one for about 100 damage, and
Damocles Photon hits all girls for 1/2 of each girl's MAX HP. Use Cura on all
girls immediately! If it uses Curse, let it be. You just concentrate onto
wasting the boss before damage piles up too high for you to handle. It's also
very commendable to break this boss in various aspects, most significantly in
power field to lessen damage it does even further.

Now that I've covered damage aspects, let me fill you in on boss' attack
pattern. It will use three swipes in a row, then use Curse on one girl - rinse
and repeat. If all three girls are cursed, boss no longer uses this attack.
Furthermore, once you bring its HP to 962 HP or below, you'll start seeing
Damocles Photon, its most dangerous attack. Attack pattern is implemented
again - three swipes, followed by Damocles Photon, then repeat. Note that
damage from Damocles Photon can be halved by shell status.

As you can see from info I've dug up, you're fairly safe until boss loses 2/3
of its HP. Up to that point you need to worry about keeping your HP only above
250 HP (just in case it manages to pull a critical on your girls). But as soon
as it enters Damocles Photon phase, pull out all the healing you can and cast
Shell on all girls. Get that white mage out now. Still problems beating the
crap out of it?

If it becomes OSF - you have very easy battle on your hands. Take note of who
will Beast start to eye (just so you know, Yuna's mine), then protect her
quickly. Now be careful - Beast will use 'swipe' against targeted girl four
times, and will then use Photon on fifth turn. Afterwards it'll eye same girl
or another girl yet again, and so we enter an endless stream of fixed attack
pattern.

You will receive SPHERE FRAGMENT KEY ITEM after the battle.

mission started, talking with her isn't needed

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ITEMS
- K - dock*: Ether, Mana Tablet, 2x Antidote, 2x Eye Drops, Phoenix Down
- K - res. area*: 1500 gil, Lunar Curtain, Star Curtain, Light Curtain, 2x

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENEMIES: Yevon Defender, Stalwart, Yevon Guard, Protochimera, League Fighter,
League Scout, Death Dauber, Red Elemental, YSLS-Zero (BOSS)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

As soon as you beat up boss of either storyline mission 3 or 4 (depending on
which you did earlier), you will promptly be thrown onto your next mission. No
way to go but Kilika, so... Engage! If you've already been to Kilika before,
then please skip next two paragraphs.

On 'K. dock' aside from looting chests (contain ETHER, MANA TABLET, 2x
ANTIDOTE, 2x EYE DROPS and PHOENIX DOWN), there are two points of interest you
can examine. In lower right of this section you'll find a woman with two kids
and monkey-like critter near her. Talk to her and you will be given a
miniquest of getting Squatter Monkeys in Kilika woods (you can't enter the
woods yet, so you will have to leave this for later). Then there's a shop you
in NW corner with following goods...
-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
KILIKA - DOCK'S SHOP
Potion 50               | Twist Headband (Sleepproof) 3000
Phoenix Down 100        | White Cape (Silenceproof) 3000
Antidote 50             | Silver Glasses (Darkproof) 3000

Echo Screen 50          |
Soft 50                 |
Holy Water 300          |
-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

Now enter N part of Kilika, called 'K - res. area'. On this screen climb
nearby stairs, then go left. You've just found Dona's house. Heheh - enter the
house after he runs off. Have a talk with Dona (at the top of her house you'll
find 1500 GIL), then explore the rest of Kilika (and relieve the chests of
LUNAR CURTAIN, 2x HOLY WATER, STAR CURTAIN, LIGHT CURTAIN). Then there's a
huge boat in SE corner of the screen. Get aboard and you'll find a man with a
camera on the boat. Talk to him and choose [Okay, thanks!] option.

Nothing else left to do but to go to N gates of 'K - res. area' - you'll be
let thru the gates automatically and mission starts!

------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------
AWESOME SPHERE HEIST!
Break through the checkpoints in the woods and at the temple steps. Once
you're in, acquire the sphere that New Yevon's been hiding in the temple!
Objective: Capture the awesome sphere
------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------

At the clearing go N and you're inside Kilika Woods. Save at SSP nearby, then
go left at 1stcross (going up or right is useless, as it's a dead end). Keep
at lefting until you see somebody run across the log to NE. Follow the suite
by taking somewhat hidden path beneath that log at 2ndcross. As you reach
3rdcross, keep going N. At 4thcross go E first until you're stopped by two
soldiers. Back at 4thcross go N - when given choice, select [Just a little
peak.], and then [More, more!]. Back to 4thcross go E, and at 5thcross go S
first until you get to two trees bending over the water. Second tree bending
over the water is your cue - a mark to press Circle will appear in lower
right, so do it. Get MEGALIXIR up here. Now returtn to 5thcross and go N to
reach SSP...

BTW, remember the woman in Kilika which asked about bringing her 13 monkeys?
You can nail them all now, but do note that you cannot return to Kilika until
CH3. So why not use the chance now and capture all of them? As you're making
your way around the woods, pay attention to noises. If you HEAR something
similar to chirping, press X and you will find Squatter Monkey. Repeat until
all 13 are in your possession.

Back to walkthru... SSP, which of course you'll use. I recommend being at LV12
at this point of game. Now it's time to play guess-da-pass. First batch of
soldiers can be dispatched by selecting [Craven Monkey!] - onto next screen
(note that if you answer incorrectly, you will have to fight them instead)!
Second batch can be avoided by selecting [Carved Monkey!] - you will get HI-
POTION, third by selecting [Craven Monkey!] - you will get ETHER, and last
batch by selecting [Carved Monkey!] TWICE! If you manage to clear thru without
fighting, you will now get TURBO ETHER and MENACE OF THE DEEP GG! One last
attempt at climbing the stairs...

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
Here's what I usually use in this battle and you should too if you've been
fluently completing sidequests: two Mythril Gloves acc (bought from Zanarkand
shop), girls as warriors, and possibly gun mage with White Wind and Mighty
Guard.

Usually starts the battle with Blast Punch. Ah, the memories... But we have to
make due without Provoke... ok, here's the beef. White mage starts by casting
Protect on all girls (or use Mighty Guard if you've learned it), then she
keeps casting Cure/Cura on all three each and every turn (in case of gun mage
use White Wind). YSLS-Zero won't hesitate in using Haymaker, which packs a big
punch.

When you see it charging for an attack, it means it'll use Blast Punch -
beware, this attack is quite dangerous, for it tears off 1/2 of target girl's
MAX HP and damage cannot be reduced by shell or protect - so it's in your best
interest to keep your HP above half at all times. On top it delays hit girl's
next turn a lot. BTW, YSLS-Zero doesn't have a set attack pattern. Apart from
that, stay healed, stay protected and stay victorious.

In OSF state Zero is far more predictable, esp by letting you know which
attacks it'll use. Zero gains the ability to inflict poison and silence on
your girls with moves called Silence Mode and Bio Mode. When it enters either
mode, your party will be hit with three punches carrying respective NEGSE. In
addition these type of punches will reduce hit girl's HP by 1/8, meaning you
can be hit with it eight times before being KO-ed. When the punching is used
three times, OFF Mode move is issued.

Still, do not get careless, as Zero still has the ability to use Blast Punch
and Haymaker - keeping HP up should be one priority. Incidentally, you can
inflict silence and poison on Zero yourself. Silence is kinda useless (this
fiend doesn't use magic), but poison can be quite good - for each HP you tear
off, YRP is closer to victory.

in previous missions - if you skipped getting gun mage DSP, you'll see three
instrument players and Tobli). For now leave them alone and check out on

the reward is worth the effort you'll put into it. Once you get the midget in,
push trumpet guy into the lift, followed by harp guy and finally drum guy.
Good job! Now here's the catch: if you're playing japanese FFX-2, you get CAT
NIP ACC (when girl is low on HP, everything deals 9999 damage), but if you're
playing US version, you get ENTERPRISE ACC.

A bunch of scenes will follow - when Yuna wakes up, restock if need be and
head for the bridge now. Talk to Bro to initiate a choice - [I've decided.]
advances the story and two HS appear on NavMap. Note that you won't be able to
choose any other destination for now!

a) If you choose Mushroom R. - after long scenes you'll be aboard Celsius. Oh
   joy, LB. annoys us again - LEBLANC'S SPHERE KEY ITEM is yours. Mission
   start!
   - if you side with League, you won't be able to get Blood of the Beast and
     Shining Mirror GG
   - entry to Bevelle will be forbidden for whole CH2 and good deal of CH3
   - there will be a subquest in Mushroom in CH5 (not doable if you sided
     with Yevon instead)
   - certain CommSphere in Bevelle in CH4 will be shot at
   - siding with League is important, if you're going for 100% in one game

b) If you choose Bevelle - Scenes, scenes and more scenes. When you're back
   onboard Celsius, LB. will be shown in a short scene... LEBLANC'S SPHERE
   KEY ITEM is yours. Mission start!
   - if you side with Yevon, you'll forfeit Nooj's Sphere key item
   - there will be a subquest in Mushroom in CH2 (not doable if you sided
     with League instead)
   - you will never be able to enter League HQ during CH2 and 5
   - certain CommSphere in Mushroom in CH4 will be thrown into water
   - if you side with Yevon, you can obtain 99% in one game

------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------
STRIP SEARCH?
The LB. Syndicate may have stolen the Gullwings' hard-earned sphere, but
you're going to sneak into Chateau LB. and steal it right back! Locate the
Syndicate members deployed across Spira and relieve them of their clothing!
Objective: Acquire three women's Syndicate uniforms
------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------

Head to bridge and talk to MN for HS to appear in Guadosalam. When you beam
down, go up and try to enter the Chateau... sorry, no access (this is an
important event which adds %). We'll need to obtain 3 dresses to disguise
ourselves. Skip next paragraph to find information on how to obtain the
disguises.

NOT SO FAST! Let's have some fun first! Second opportunity of completing bonus
stuff is at your disposal. Don't want to be bothered with it, but instead wish
to continue the story?
Press CTRL + F and type in this phrase, without the asterisks: *SKIP002*.

Storyline m.     - Triggers next storyline mission and advances the story. Be
                   advised that you cannot return to airship during some of
                   such missions.
Sidequest No.    - Denotes sidequest is available in target area.
                   [...] parenthesis denote that sidequest is 'hidden', ie
                   you can't see it on NavMap screen. You need to beam down
                   to target area and find the trigger which allows you to
                   start the mission.
Treasure         - Visit the area and free the contents of all chests.*
Scene            - Area worth visiting for few extra scenes.
PR Mission       - Most extensive sidequest IMO. Triggered in CH1 and lasts
                   whole game. Simply play minigames and lose credits.
Bride Mission    - Another extensive sidequest. Not worth your time IMO.
Caution          - Be careful when picking these destinations. Each of those
                   prompts you to advance storyline mission 6, but we don't
                   want that right now.

*   - Even though not indicated, all of the 15 areas you can visit contain
      treasure chests that can be looted.

As far as the rest of the village goes, nothing of special interest. Now back
to 'B - waterfall w. 1' and drop down behind first bridge to score WALL RING
ACC. On 'B - beach' climb the ledge immediately to your left as you enter and
hop across to reach the secluded area of the beach with two chests containing
1500 GIL and 2x HI-POTION. Then you can score 3x POTION and 2x ETHER in 'B -
cave', but latter only if you have found second set of four ciphers using
Search Sphere. Return to Besaid Aurochs, talk to either of them and when
prompted, choose [You're on, Beclem.]...

------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------
RUN THE GUNNER'S GAUNTLET!
Gun down fiends and make your way to the beach within the time limit! Score
high and put Beclem's record to shame!
Objective: Score more than 500 points and make your way to the beach
------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------

This mission is more of a minigame. Your objective is to rack more than 500
points in a game called Gunner's Gauntlet. Unfortunately for you I will need
to direct you to another part of my guide, section 19, where all details for
this minigame are included. You have 7 minutes to make it to Besaid beach.
Sounds easy, eh? Well, it's not easy since you have to be better than 500
points in order to have this MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! If you manage to score more
than 500 points, you also score ENIGMA PLATE GG.

After completing the sidequest mission you can attempt Gunner's Gauntlet yet
again for higher levels and more prizes, which are: POWER WRIST ACC, SILVER
BRACER ACC, TITANIUM BANGLE ACC, MORTAL COIL GG, BEADED BROOCH ACC, DIAMOND
GLOVES ACC, FAERIE EARRINGS ACC and ADAMANTITE ACC.

Of all those prizes there are only two left that are IMO worthy to long for.
One is Mortal Coil GG and other Adamantite (DEF+120, MDEF+120, Auto-Wall AAB,
but reduces AGL by 30 points). If you're not feeling up to task, feel free to
explore the rest of Besaid and do stuff. If scoring 500 points is too much for
you, you can attempt this cheesy trick - at 'B - waterfall way 1' stand below
the very last waterfall. If you stand here and gun down enemies, you won't be
attacked at all! This is the safest place to rack up insane amounts of points,
and scoring that Adamantite should be a breeze.

KADFC suggests this:
- You must be at Lv6+ to get Volleys from Bicocettes.
- Once you get one, and have at least 50 HP, immediately run to the blind
  spot. It doesn't matter if you get hit or not, you should have enough HP to
  last
- If you get hit, other fiends close by won't attack you unless they're
  coming up.
- Once at the blind spot, keep on pressing Circle. The dead-click, a word
  that I just made up, means fiend clicked on will be killed later on.
- Keep on pressing Circle, until you see Bicocette (the purple fiend with a
  purple/violet shell). You can do this anytime during or before he leaves
  the screen. I prefer before it leaves the screen. Fire the Volley.
- This will kill all the fiends that had the dead-click on it. It doesn't
  matter how far they went, they are dead. Don't bother to go all the way
  back and collect all the ammo, the only one that you'll need is from
  Bicocette (THE VOLLEY!)
- Repeat until you have around 40 seconds left. Adamantite is yours!

Enter the area to 'H - S end'. On your way to 'H - agency, f' you can raid
seven chests with MUSCLE BELT ACC, 1000 GIL, 3x PHOENIX DOWN, 3x ANTIDOTE, 3x
POTION, SILVER BRACER ACC and 3x HOLY WATER. Behind the agency you can nail 3x
EYE DROPS. Do NOT enter the agency yet! If you're doing publicity and/or
bridal mission/s, you *must* explore the rest of Mi'ihen. Reason? If you
attempt sidequest mission available here, certain parts of Mi'ihen become
blocked until CH3. So if you wanna get everything, don't enter the agency,
instead ransack the chests still left for 3x PHOENIX DOWN, 2x GRENADE, ETHER,
2x POTION, 3x ECHO SCREEN and 3x SOFT. Now you are ready to take the quest!

Enter the agency - inside you will see a girl talking about chocobos. Here are
shop's wares...

Exit the agency and approach the girl on the summit... While you're talking
with the girl, a choice will pop up - pick [I think I remember...] and then
[Of course!]. Thanks to Gigafreak for getting one worry off my back.

------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------
CUCKOO FOR CHOCOBOS!
Your mission: catch the chocobo for Calli! Follow Captain Rikku's instructions
and bring that winged whirlwind to justice! It's the kwest of a lifetime!
Objective: Capture the chocobo?
------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------

Follow Rikku's innocent ass... I mean, follow her! From your position take the
exit S from Rin agency. Follow Rikku by running S all the time. Don't fall too
far behind or you will have to retry this part of hunting. Still, I recommend
that you do fall behind couple of times.

As you'll run S, you'll spot some feathers on the ground. Simply run over them
and a chime will sound. Why bother? On your trip Rikku will stop three times
and make a comment. Pick [Sure!] to get a chance to nail a prize or [Not this
time.] to continue the pursuit.

If you'll go for the chests, here: for 0 feathers ran over chest is empty, for
1-3 you get 2x CHOCOBO FEATHER, for 4-14 you get 3x CHOCOBO FEATHER, for 15-17
you get 2x CHOCOBO WING, for 18-21 you get 3x CHOCOBO WING. You can't raid
same chest multiple times and hope for multiple copies of items. After prize
is looted, choose [You betcha!] to retry.

Amount of feathers also dictates award you get once you leave this screen: for
0 feathers ran over you get big fat nothing, for 1-8 you get GOLD HOURGLASS,
for 9-15 you get CHOCOBO FEATHER, for 16-21 you get 2x CHOCOBO FEATHER.

Chocobo will now want to play left-middle-or-right minigame with you. Paine
will cover one end of the road, while Rikku occupies the other. Have Yuna
approach the chocobo at side of the road and it will escape ahead. When you
approach it again, you are given three seconds to judge (based on direction
chocobo is looking at) in which direction chocobo will try to make it past
you. If chocobo is looking left, press left directional, if right, press right
directional. If it's looking in Yuna's direction, don't press anything. Guess
correctly five or six times and it's onto next screen. You *must* mess up
twice or thrice, as messing up is grounds for one event later in this mission
and a subquest in CH4.

Tip: at one point game will inform you that chocobo lost its concentration, so
it will be much easier to guess where it wants to run. Contributor Bryan G.
says that if you manage to stop it in its tracks six times in a row, you can
already catch it here. Sweet.

Follow Rikku and Paine in their tracks - their location will be marked by a
blue encircled arrow on the minimap. Each time you arrive at marked
destination, a scene will occur. After you view second one and you have Yuna
run S, you *must* see a scene where Rikku lands on her butt. After viewing
third scene in total, chocobo escapes again. Arrrrgh, so close too! Just you
wait! Go all the way to S exit of 'H - S end' - talk to the nearby female Al
Bhed twice and pick [Please, yes!]. Chocobo is yours at last!

Time for one of many friendly reunions as well. When Yuna is under your
control again, save your game, then follow Rikku and Paine - notice the red
arrow in minimap? After a scene you have 150 seconds to make it to the point
of impact before it's too late... got you worried, huh? That's more then
enough time.

BOSS STRATEGY
Boss relies heavily on brute force, but is also capable of using a variety of
element spells against your party - Thundara, Blizzara, Fira and Watera. But
do you know what makes him extra easy and predictable? Whenever it uses
'smack', it will always attack the girl with highest current HP.

Should you choose to make half of its attacks useless, you have several
options at your disposal - silence it, or steal all of its MP (quite a few
ways to do it). It can also be slowed, further making its appearance futile.
You cannot lower the damage it does to you as boss is immune to STR down NEGSE
- but you can affect its DEF and MDEF instead.

A nice way to start the battle is using warrior's Armor and Mental Breaks,
followed up by black mage's fire spells or Flametongue ACTA by warrior. If you
want to draw attacks to a specific girl, make her HP as high as you can prior
to battle, beef up her DEF and cast Protect over her during battle. Remember
to regularly heal her and you cannot lose this battle.

OSF battle is IMO even easier than 'regular' battle. Like with OSF Guardian
Beast Eater will make a move called 'Me no like you!' - afterwards it will
launch four PATK against the girl chosen. After those four attacks it may
switch back to flurry of MATK (set up reflect to have spells bounce back at
Eater) or decide to continue being tired of a certain girl. Don't forget that
protect can be helpful here as well. Reducing boss' MAG stat will be useful in
reducing damage it does with its MATK. Or - simply silence it.
*****************************************************************************

MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! You receive SELENE GUARD GG! Do not press any buttons
during ending scene - you must see an event where Rikku will be running across
the bridge like crazy, causing the approaching hover to fall off the cliff in
the process - take note that you won't actually see the scene itself, but it's
easy to draw this conclusion from the events prior to the hover falling off
the cliff. You're back on Celsius, but there's more to be done on Mi'ihen
road. Once again choose to beam down there - look, it's Clasko! Talk to him or
the girl nearby and pick [All aboard!]. They both board Celsius, so do the
same.

* - While you're navigating 'M - ravine path', look for some rocks which serve
as a drop off base to reach 'M - ravine'.
** - Den of Woe is currently off limits. Only way to enter this dungeon is by
collecting 10 Crimson Spheres, which spans over all five story chapters.
*** - If you gave the sphere back to New Yevon, 'M - HQ lift' is as far as you
can get during this CH.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ITEMS
- Mushroom: 1500 gil, Hi-Potion
- M - ravine 1: 2x Turbo Ether, Phoenix Down, Ether
- M - ravine 2: Crimson Sphere 7
- M - HQ lift: Kinesis Badge**, Shining Mirror GG**, Shining Bracer***
- Youth HQ: Mythril Bangle***
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENEMIES: Coyote, Drowsy Ochu, Tonberry, Bully Cap, Red Elemental, League
Raider*, League Warrior*, League Trooper*, League Soldier*, League Ranger*,
Miss E. (BOSS)*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* - these enemies will fight you if you gave the sphere back to New Yevon
** - these items are obtained if you gave the sphere back to New Yevon
*** - these items are obtained if you gave the sphere to Youth League
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Depending on events you did in the past two possible outcomes may happen here.
First I'll tell what happens if you give the sphere back to New Yevon.

As soon as you get to 'Mushroom', you'll notice a red arrow in minimap in
upper left. Follow it and scene is triggered. It's time to kick some high ass,
then! Mission starts as you enter 'M - ravine path'.

------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------
WHO NEEDS AN INVITATION?
The Youth League's edgier members have drawn their own conclusions and
declared the Gullwings an enemy. Beat them back as you push through to League
headquarters!
Objective: Reach the lift leading to headquarters
------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------

Before you can use the lift, you'll need to dispose of two soldiers. Piece of
cake. Board the lift and kill next four soldiers (in waves of two). On your
way to second lift you could prolly be bothered enough to dispose of any Ochus
you can lay your swords on - EXP awarded is well worth the effort put in.
After killing both Ochus you will encounter fourth and last wave of rogue
soldiers - kill them.

Yooohooo, Red Riding Hood... what the...?

BOSS STRATEGY
How would you like this battle to play out? As a rule of thumb Miss E. will
usually try to haste herself first turn she gets in battle. After that she
favors PATK, but as her HP grows lower and lower, you will be seeing more and
more of status magic being used against your girls, especially slow. Counter
this either by dispeling Miss E.'s haste, or put her to sleep (quite an
abnormal status immunity to be missing from a boss) and then pound her with
MATK.

Two soldiers that are nearby to help 'defeat' (or be defeated) you are quite
laughable. Nevertheless, dispose of them first - their HP is not so high, but
should you leave them to keep attacking you, there would be too much worries
on your back, so... kill both soldiers first, then turn your attacks against
Miss E.

Miss E. surprisingly also packs Thunder magic, which hits all girls, so in
heat of battle you may want to switch to white mage and have her cast Shell on
all girls. If you can keep Miss E. asleep during whole battle, you will almost
certainly see no attacks coming from her direction.
*****************************************************************************

After kicking her ass use the second lift. On 'M - HQ lift' approach the big
lift... figures. Cluck cluck! MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! You receive KINESIS BADGE
ACC and SHINING MIRROR GG.

And now for story telling of what happens if Youth League got the sphere...

As soon as you get to 'Mushroom', you'll notice a red arrow in minimap in
upper left. Follow it and scene is triggered - enter 'M - ravine path'. Before
you can use the lift, couple of soldiers will tell you that about escort.
Board the lift and proceed going N - on your way to second lift you will
notice couple of Ochus. If you don't wish to fight them, go past them, but
*slowly* - tilt your left stick ever so ligthly so that Yuna tiptoes.

When you get to 'M - HW lift', storm the chest for SHINING BRACER ACC, then
use the lift to enter 'Youth HQ'. Here jump to tiny path on right side of the
screen and score MYTHRIL BANGLE ACC. Don't forget to find Elma and Lucil
around here - have a chat with them.

Regardless of your past choices you can do this: after completing sidequest
mission (or if you weren't doing it) beam down to 'Mushroom rock' again -
visit N part of this screen, use the stone as the lift and raid two chests
here for 1500 GIL and HI-POTION. Then return to 'M - ravine path' once again.
Remember the place where Slim and Fatso jumped down in 'M - ravine 1' to
access some weird door? Do the same yet again and find your way to that weird
door (during your trip raid the chests for 2x TURBO ETHER, PHOENIX DOWN and
ETHER). In 'M - ravine 2' a scene will issue, after which you obtain CRIMSON
SPHERE 7 KEY ITEM (make sure you watch it as soon as you're aboard Celsius!).
There's nothing more left to do here.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rightio then, let's do some selling! As soon as you have control, go right. On
'M - S bank' talk to red midget and pick [Okay, sounds like fun!]. Mission has
started!

------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------
YRP, THE SCALPERS THREE!
Talk to people along the south and north banks of the Moonflow with Square and
sell as many tickets as possible. The base price is 500* gil, but if you can
sell the tickets off at a higher price, the profits are yours!
Objective: Sell tickets and report to Tobli
------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------

* - if you did not speak to Tobli before completing Shave the Hypello mission
in CH1, then the base price for tickets will be 1000 gil instead!

You have ten tickets to be sold to some people found in Moonflow (14 people
are willing to buy tickets). You can sell tickets by addressing people with
Square. You will be given a choice of how much will you charge for single
ticket - will you charge 200, 500, 1000, 1500 or go as high as 2000 gil?
Choice is yours... or not, if you follow this guide. Note that you can try
selling the ticket to specific person only once! If you charge too high,
person won't buy a ticket and you will have wasted one chance out of ten you
are given. And finally, not everyone is willing to buy tickets. Play your gil
smart and you will win.

Here's the chart of peeps and how much gil you can relieve them of:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
*  - sell tickets to these people

Maximum gil profit amount you can score is 12500 gil. After you attempt to
sell your 10th ticket, you will automatically view a scene with red midget.
You *must* sell all 10 tickets with a profit or at least breaking even - this
makes sure you get full % for the event! It's also important for later events
in the game. MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! What, the rewards? Here...

Here's a nice way of getting 90000 gil in a flash. Save your game first, Enter
'G - data dealer' screen - BTW, you need 10000 gil. Talk to the guy behind the
counter, pick [Got any data?], then [Sounds good, I'll take it.]. You will be
given a clue about THE person, now you need to figure out just who the hell is
THE person. Meaning you should address various people in Guadosalam and hope
you'll manage to find correct one. If one clue is not enough, pick [Got any
data?] again and you'll learn of second clue.

Solution? Try out three people by addressing them with Square button. Once you
nail the correct one, you receive grand prize of 10000 times X (X ranges from
1 to 10) gil (sooner you figure out who THE person is, fatter the reward).
Should you fail to locate THE person, you lose 10000 gil you paid for the
info. Oopsies.

Here's a handy chart with first hint provided and who's THE person.

given three places: Djose, Gagazet and Bikanel. Still, do NOT go to any of
these areas yet. We'll tackle all the others first.

ENEMIES: Lesser Drake, Armet, Chocobo, Red Elemental, Ochu, Stalwart, Gold

All of the items mentioned in Item checklist are found in chests. Here a fun
minigame awaits that tests your skills at remembering and timing. When you
enter Thunder plains, speak to kneeling Al Bhed and choose [Maybe we can
help?]. You will now need to 'recalibrate' 10 towers found across Thunder
plains (5 in S, 5 in N). Info for this minigame is found in section 19.

Back in CH1, while you were doing Zanarkand mission and if you picked [You bet
I do.] option when talking to Cid, he now appears in Thunder p. between towers
2 and 3. He's really hard to miss as you'll see purple X in your mini-map.

Here are the wares of 'TP - agency'.
-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
THUNDER P. - AGENCY'S SHOP
Potion 50               | Lightning Gleam (Lightningstrike) 3000
Phoenix Down 100        | Yellow Ring (Lit. Ward, Thunder ACTA) 3000
Antidote 50             |

-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

The Al Bhed you spoke to before is also located inside this house. Speak to
him to learn of your progress on towers you've attempted so far, and to revise
rules and regulations of calibration minigame. Once you attempt all ten
towers, and when you calibrate at least five towers perfectly, you receive
SAMURAI'S HONOR GG! To get this awesome GG, I recommend calibrating towers 1,
2, 3, 4 and 6, cos they're easiest IMO. BTW, amount of calibrations you make
on single tower affects certain sidequest in CH5 in Thunder p. - more
calibrations means better prize. My recommendation? Don't bother, because 7th
and 10th tower will make you go crazy.

reopen for duration of CH2

ITEMS

ENEMIES: Haizhe, Deep Haizhe, White Elemental, Gold Elemental, Red Elemental,
Amorphous Gel, Barbuta, Chocobo, Flan Azul, Sallet, Xiphactinus
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* - if you didn't get it in CH1, this item is awarded to you by talking to
Tromell four times, but you must complete sidequest mission 10 first; this is
your last and final chance to get it
** - Minerva's Plate is yours only if you skip talking to Tobli during 'Shave
the Hypello!' sidequest back in CH1, going directly to the Hypello instead and
ensuring all five bags were safely delivered
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

As you enter Macalania forest, you'll see a Hypello on a path ahead. Talk to
him and pick [Shure, why not?], then head for 'MW - spring 2'. You'll reach
the place with the huge sphere (should be familiar to you anyway if you were
doing sidequest mission 04 back in CH1). Talk to Bayra...

------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------
TRACK DOWN THE TROUPE!
Find Donga and Pukutak somewhere in the woods. They have taken the form of
whirling circles of butterflies. Enter the circles and they will return to
their true forms.
Objective: Meet with Donga and Pukutak
------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------

...you must locate missing musicians. There's five of them in total and this
section discloses their locations. Just some words of advice if you'll bother
looking for them yourself - keep your eyes peeled for rings of butterflies!
These rings denote 'hiding places' of runaway musicians. Just walk thru the
ring and somebody will pop up out of nowhere. Do remember to address some of
them so they say their lines and teleport away. Also, doing this quest will
net you one more GG later in CH3.

On 'MW - spring 2' you can locate two butterfly rings (2 down, 3 to go). Back
to 'MW - lake road' and this time make use of SE exit to reach 'MW - north 2'.
Follow your nose - on your way to third butterly ring you'll need to kill some
enemies (this is guaranteed battle, not even No Encounters can prevent it)...
you can flee too. Walk thru third ring - 3 down, 2 to go. Continue pressing S
for another fixed battle - after battle you will come down shiny path and end
up near SSP, which you should use to save your game.

Now go to 'MW - spring 1' - you've found fourth butterfly ring (4 down, 1 to
go). You will be teleported to the screen with the harp guy, but do not
address him yet! You're not done collecting the musicians... retrack to 'MW -
lake road' and now choose SW exit. As you go along, you'll spot last butterfly
ring in the air. Keep holding left and Circle at same time to have Yuna jump
the gap, thus shortening your travel distance a bit. Go up the nearby slope
and when near the ring, hold directionals towards it and press Circle to have
Yuna jump thru the ring. That's all musicians.

Now return to Bayra and talk to him for this to be MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! You
receive HASTE BANGLE ACC. Choose [No] when given option, as there's still
stuff to do in Macalania. If you haven't talked to him in CH1, Tromell now
appears - talk to him four times and he hands over FULL THROTTLE SDSP and
UNERRING PATH GG. Return to Hypello you spoke earlier and you'll fetch some
more rewards: BITTER FAREWELL GG and possibly MINERVA'S PLATE ACC.

As far is scoring the rest of the items goes: in 'MW - central 2' you can raid
SILVER BRACER ACC, while in 'MW - central 1' ICY GLEAM ACC awaits Yuna.
Lastly, raid the chest with 2x HI-POTION on 'Lake Mac. - agency, f'.

Missed the chance of getting O'aka in CH1? Now's your second chance to do so -
for more details please refer to sidequest mission 04 entry.

If you've turned O'aka over to Al Bhed back in CH1 (or CH2, at which time you
can also attempt 'Follow that O'aka' mission), visit the agency for...

doing it for now! Digging minigame is temporarily not available.

So you've completed storyline mission 6 and wish to dig some more? Talk with
pilot and more options become available: you can now explore Southern Expanse,

chances for scoring items at the Oasis. Try scavenging more parts if you're
feeling up to the task. Wish to go back to where you left off in the walkthru?

several battles against Yevon guards as you make your way N on 'Highbridge'.

Now that mission has started, you're advised to stop by Guadosalam first and
buy three sets of Angel Earrings. Deathproof AAB they have will prove
invaluable just in case you run into Queen Coeurl inside here.

There's SSP at the start of dungeon, so use it if you wish. Take into
consideration these three tips:
- Not all fiends are real. Some are only an illusion. Touching an illusionary
  fiend will cause it to vanish.
- Only one real fiend appears at a time. Any other fiends you see are
  illusions.
- The illusionary fiends face the direction of the real fiend. Of course,
  with some fiends it's difficult to tell which way they're facing at all.

If you mess up three times in locating the real fiend, you'll see red arrows
appear above fiends indicating direction they're looking at. With help of
these arrows it shouldn't be a problem now to get rid of five real fiends.

2nd bout VS Queen Coeurl & Armet
3rd bout VS Skink & Armet
4th bout VS 3x Armet
5th bout VS Queen Coeurl & Skink

Scene is triggered. Yo, Clasko, wassup? Kill 6th, final monsters (you'll fight
3x Blue Elemental) to have this MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! For your troubles you
will receive ALCHEMIST DSP and HIGHROAD WINDS GG. Note that monster arena is
now chocobo breeding grounds. Look a bit below.

Return to 'CL - ruins', turn right, examine chocobo sign and pick [Hey,
Clasko!] to receive bunch of GYSAHL GREENS and bunch of PAHSANA GREENS. Now go
out and *make sure* you capture one chocobo before end of CH3.

Here's information that will fill you in on what must be done to access
Chocobo ranch, alchemist DSP and more:
- meet Clasko in CH1 during 'Foggy Fiend Frenzy!' sidequest mission in
  Mushroom; after completing this mission, return to SSP found at the
  entrance to 'Mushroom rock' screen - he'll be located on the right; talk to
  him and say [The more, the merrier!]; then participate in 'Cuckoo for
  Chocobos!' mission on Mi'ihen in CH2 - Clasko will help you; after wasting
  the boss enter 'M - agency, f' screen and invite both Clasko and Calli
  onboard (Calli will come onboard only if you were able to get a chocobo for
  her); finally go to Calm lands, enter the 'Facility ruins' and complete
  'Clean Sweep' mission; chocobo ranch is now open
- if you did not participate in 'Foggy Fiend Frenzy!' mission or didn't
  invite Clasko on Celsius, then find him in CH2 on 'Mushroom rock' screen
  just before you enter 'M - ravine path' - he'll run off to Calm lands and
  you'll find him there in CH3 - complete 'Clean Sweep' mission and ranch is
  open, you also get your longed for DSP
- if you invite Clasko onboard, but fail to stop by Calm lands in CH2, he'll
  appear there automatically in CH3 - ranch is open, you also get your longed
  for DSP
- if you do not talk to Clasko in CH1 or CH2, ranch isn't open for business
  and Clasko's whereabouts are unknown for remainder of the game

Right before the entrance to the cloister you'll spot Isaaru, so have a talk
with him. Awww, too bad, Isaaru, for your cash income is about to be shot
down. Your objective is to pair up 24 monkeys. Pay close attention to their
names - reminds me of bridal mission, hehe. So how do we start?

1st pair: Head further into cloister, down the elevator and into 'Dome - the
beyond' (screen 6 for further reference). You'll find Birch with hearts
popping out of its head. Talk to it and pick [Grab him]. Yuna will grab the
animal - now what? Carry it around and find a partner for it. Birch's partner
is found in 'Dome - chamber' (screen 4 for further reference). Just examine
them all and Sequoia will jump happily.
2nd pair: Go into 'Dome - great hall' (screen 5 for further reference). Pick
up Spring. Now carry it up the elevator and into 'Dome - cloister 1' (screen 2
for further reference). Pair it up with Autumn.
3rd pair: Pick up Dusky in 'Dome - corridor' (screen 1 for further reference).
Pair it up with Dawne, found in screen 6.
4th pair: Pick up Rosemary found in screen 5. Carry it up the elevator into
'Dome - cloister 2' (screen 3 for further reference) and pair it up with
Thyme.
5th pair: What luck! In same area where you just 'delivered' pick up Terran.
Carry it to screen 6 to match it up with Skye.
6th pair: Minni? Screen 5. Maxx? Screen 3.
7th pair: Summer? Screen 4. Winter? Screen 1.

standing still anywhere is fine too). When the man in grey robe goes in, enter
'D - reception'. Talk to the person in the middle of the room, choose [I want
to dig!]. Back outside try approaching the entrance to temple - two guys will
move aside, so enter 'Great hall'. Now go back outside to 'D - p. road'.
Choose [We're sure.] when given choice and you'll get Letter of Introduction
key item. Now go to Bikanel.

You will find Nhadala in upper right corner straight away. Talk to her and
choose [I've got this letter...]. When she briefs you on situation, try to go
away from her - she'll stop you and ask you to go investigate the Oasis. Now
talk to hover pilot to start the mission.

BOSS STRATEGY
Hmmm, Slim brought along reinforcements. Too bad they won't do him any good.
Start the battle by taking out two fighters first to get rid of element spells
they chuck in your direction. Another easy solution would be to have white
mage cast Reflect on your girls - this way damage will pile up quite quickly,
hehe. Once both fighters are eliminated, have white mage cast Protect over
your girls as well, then change into warrior and proceed with Slim's
asskicking.

Slim has vastly improved his array of attacks. Warriors are job of choice for
this fight (soon we'll get ourselves much better DSP). As Slim is able to put
darkness or silence on all three gals at once, I recommend you bring some Eye
Drops and Echo Screens with you. When you see Slim take defensive stance, he
is prepping to use either Hush Grenade or Flash Bomb for about 50 damage to
all. If he starts talking during it, expect to see Hail of Bullets attack.
Heal your wounds if HP falls below 100 - white mage's Pray ability can come in
handy, as it isn't affected by silence.

BOSS STRATEGY
Take out Fem-Goon to get rid of her element spells. As before, consider an
option of having white mage cast Reflect on your party with devastating
effects for your opponents. Slim has same attacks as last fight, whereas Fatso
doesn't gain anything new - but he does have an attack pattern. He'll bash one
girl twice, then use Pirouette Pitch on each third turn (Pirouette Pitch is
used against the girl with lowest current HP). When Fatso is extremely low on
HP, he starts using Conscussive Shock for 200 damage too all girls for most of
his attacks - spare Fatso for last to dispose of in this boss battle. Both
guys can also be put to sleep, should you consider using some status fun in
the battle.

I recommend warriors for this fight and a white mage with Silenceproof acc,
bringing some Eye Drops and Echo Screens with you just in case you don't have
any Silenceproof stuff. When you see Slim take defensive stance, he's about to
use either Flash Bomb or Hush Grenade for around 50 damage to all. If he
starts talking during it, expect to see Hail of Bullets attack. Similarly,
Fatso's spinning means he'll do Pirouette Pitch - about 80. His usual ram
attack takes about 150 damage. Heal your wounds if HP falls below 200! Now
it's not the time to be taking into consideration 'Will I make it or not...?'
If need be, heal - remember that white mage's Pray ability isn't affected by
Silence. Lastly, you now possess all three SDSP - if you're having problems
with this battle, you may consider using them for some major ownage.

Back on 'Celsius' beam to Gagazet. Meet Kimahri and talk to him twice. Like in
CH1, talking to Kimahri and other Ronsos has huge impact on events following
in later chapters. Here's choices you should make in this CH:

- [You have to figure this out on your own.] - pick this!!!
- [He does seem very tired.]
- [And what of the Guado.]
- [Maybe the Guado really are to blame.]
- [What if the Guado retaliate?]
- [Please, try to think about it some more.]
- [Then...there won't be anyone left to fight.]
- [They should take better care of the mountain.] - this guy is in 'G -
   mountain c1'

Make your way up the mountain to 'G - fayth scar 1'.

------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------
SPRING INTO ACTION
You'll need uniforms to sneak into Chateau LB! So what are you waiting for?
Get to it!
Objective: Obtain a Syndicate uniform
------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------

Start climbing the ledges until you reach top-most one. Head bit right and
you'll see a cave entrance. Still go right, but WALK and hold Circle so that
Yuna jumps to floating rock - ELIXIR is yours. Go inside 'G - scar cave 1' now
and follow an easy path - as you reach 1stcross, take a *right* and continue
jumping process to nail a chest with HI-POTION. Back to 1stcross continue up N
path. Keep at it and you'll soon reach this cave's exit and enter 'G - fayth
scar 2'. Outside continue right, climb up two ledges and drop down on the
right (follow the girl). You now have two options available. Continue reading
this paragraph for first option. But if you're interested in second option,
skip following boss battle entry and read info below it on how to access it
(anyway, you MUST view the long hot spring scene if you want to get full % for
the event and 100% in the end).

FIRST OPTION (again, this one won't give you 100% in the end, so go with
second option instead!): Save at SSP and enter another cave. Blahblah later...

1. 'Bash' - VS one chr - phd
2. Pirouette Pitch - VS one chr - phd
3. Concussive Shock - STATT VS all chrs - std
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
Concussive Shock hits all girls for 200 damage and he has also become very
powerful considering other two attacks. Bring in white mage and keep casting
Cura on all members. Meanwhile have two warriors soften up Fatso with Power
Break, then continue hitting it with PATK. Fatso can also be put to sleep, and
you can now proceed hammering him with MATK. Again, Fatso's spinning means
he'll throw his shield for big damage - about 300. His usual ram attack can
take about 450 damage! Heal your wounds if HP falls below 500!

Here's an easy way to figure out what he'll use. 'Bash', 'bash', Pirouette
Pitch, repeat. Be careful if Fatso is extremely low on HP - he'll keep using
Concussive Shock over and over again for 200 damage to all girls (bypasses
protect), so it's in your best interest to kill him fast and painless
(question is, for who?). And remember - if need be, heal!
*****************************************************************************

After the battle you'll need to take out two magicians - piece of cake. I've
made it to LV16 with my girls at this point of game. I will no longer advise
on what levels you should be at certain spots in the game. If boss you're
facing is too strong and my strategy doesn't help, you need to level up and
improve your skills.

SECOND OPTION (this is the one you MUST see to get 100% in the end): Soooo,
you wish to know about other, MORE secret approach? Instead of following the
girl when you spot her for second time, CONTINUE climbing up and up. At the
peak of climbing go LEFT when you can, and now SLOWLY walk toward the floating
rocks and hold Circle so that Yuna jumps there - score WHITE CAPE ACC.

Retrack and go right now - you'll come across 'G - scar cave 2' with PHOENIX
DOWN inside, then continue with climbing up. How much longer, man? I wanna
those... Knock it off! Heh. During your climb you'll see a natural hole of
sorts with rock sticking out on another side. Walk on it to trigger a scene.
SYNDICATE UNIFORM KEY ITEM belongs to you. Sit back and relax in natural
beauty of Gagazet (eyes wander off in funny direction).

After scene is over, make a save at SSP and try to get off the mountain.
Dispose of two disposable assassins (and one worm), then make somebody else
regret he got in your way as well. For strategy on upcoming boss please view
boss battle entry just a bit above. Once it's time for MISSION ACCOMPLISHED,
you get STONEHEWN GG.

With this Storyline Mission 6 has come to an end. BUM RUSH GG is yours.

(BOSS)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* - item scored depends on when did you manage to satisfy LB. in an upcoming
minigame; satisfying her on first try awards Gold Hairpin, subsequent ones
will get you Heady Perfume

There's still HS located at Guadosalam. Talk to MN and beam down there.
Approach the manor and choice will be given - select [Okay!]...

------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------
FAKING AND ENTERING
Nobody steals from the Gullwings! Sneak into Chateau LB and take back what's
rightfully yours!
Objective: Recover the stolen sphere
------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------

...and access inside the manor is granted. After some yadda-yadda enter 'Ch. -
living r'. Inside you'll find Fatso and Slim - get near them to get some
clues. Also note the place Fatso is standing - it'll be important later. Now
get back out and go up the stairs into 'Ch. - private q'. She's standing in a
corner, so approach her - now you need to give her a massage.

Short recap on how does this minigame work:
You have 15 tries to massage 9 parts of LB.'s body. You must accrue 32 points
to complete this minigame. Select the body part on 3x3 grid with directionals
and press X to apply massage. Blue spot is worth 0, green 1, yellow 2 and red
5 points. If you don't succeed at first, ante is upped: blue spot is now worth
0, green 2, yellow 3 and red 5 points. Additionally, finding red spot clears
whole grid and resets the spots (you'll see what I mean if you mess up). My
advice is to mess up at first, so point value is upped on second try, then
find yellow spot and keep massaging it to get points needed. You will get
Heady Perfume acc later on in the secret room, which is awesome IMO for its HP
Stroll and MP Stroll abilities.

Fatso and Slim enter the room - this means you can now get in 'Ch. - living
r.' below undisturbed! Stand at the spot Fatso was blocking when you talked
with them before and examine the wall near left blue pedestal. Secret door
opens and it's joyful time for new dungeon.

1. 'Swipe' - VS one chr - phd
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
First take out two other enemies that appear with Fatso - this will eliminate
excess damage. Fatso gained another new attack - if you see him put his shield
on the back and knocking on his head, prepare to do some reviving. He'll use
Huggles, extremely powerful attack for up to 1200 damage on one girl. His two
other attacks are still deadly as well. Where's the fun here? Fatso has
somewhat of an attack pattern (but don't count on it for being accurate, as
I've seen Fatso attack differently) - 'bash', 'bash', 'bash', Supercollider,
repeat. Huggles is used a lot once Fatso is in critical condition. Also note
that this time you cannot put him to sleep.

Bring in white mage and keep casting Cura on all members (apply protect on all
girls as well). Meanwhile have two warriors soften up Fatso with Power Break,
then continue hitting it with PATK. Again, Fatso's spinning means he'll throw
his shield for annoying results - target's HP will be halved and next turn
delayed a bit. His usual ram attack can take about 250 damage! Heal your
wounds if HP falls below 400! Now it's not the time to be taking into
consideration 'Will I make it or not...?' If need be, heal!
*****************************************************************************

After defeating Fatso proceed N. Save at SSP and at 1stcross go N thru a door
to a room. Nail the chest here which contains either GOLD HAIRPIN ACC or HEADY
PERFUME ACC, then back to 1stcross take E path. Still go E at 2nscross and
enter next room. Collect the sphere and CRIMSON SPHERE 10 KEY ITEM (make sure
you watch it as soon as you're aboard Celsius!) is yours for winning, but...

2. Russian Roulette - VS one chr - phd, can also induce KO, curse, silence,
   petrify or poison
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
TAKE SLIM OUT ASAP! If not, he'll use Russian Roulette and who knows what kind
of results it'll bring. Anyway, you will see Russian Roulette on every fourth
turn Slim gets, so use this info to your battle plan advantage. Fatso still
follows his route of 'bash', 'bash', 'bash', Supercollider, repeat (some
discrepancies may apply, but this is the most frequent attack pattern I've
observed). Careful when Fatso enters critical HP stage - Huggles attacks will
come flying in your direction, so do take care of finishing Fatso soon once
his HP is very low! In case you're interested in some status fun, try out
sleep and poison.

In case of petrified girl Fatso can follow up with Supercollider to shatter
her. Slim also packs bullets with poison, silence and curse effects, but these
aren't so annoying. Can't say the same for death effect bullet, tho'. White
mage is almost a must - her Esuna will lift both petrify and poison. When you
see Slim take defensive stance, he's about to use Russian Roulette, so beware
and be ready with right countermeasures. Otherwise Slim hits for 60 damage and
Fatso for 200 damage. Heal your wounds if HP falls below 200!
*****************************************************************************

After defeating them, get out of the room. At 2ndcross take N path now -
you'll reach 3rdcross. Now refer to minimap for directions! At 3rdcross E path
is a dead end, you can't yet reach N path, so only way to go is W path.

Climb ub the ledge, then jump across both pits and proceed toward dead end.
Spike alert! What do you do? Nothing, simply run into the spike wall... Yuna
appears near security override switch 1, so choose [Activate the override].
Jump down, go N and climb the ledge. Drop down in next pit and activate
override switch 2.

Climb out and drop into next hole to activate override switch 3. Back out and
continue up to where the spike wall emerged. Approach another switch and
select [Open the door.]. Access to another part of this dungeon has been
opened. Before entering circular door I recommend to save! Now you're ready
for final showdown!

BOSS STRATEGY
TAKE SLIM OUT ASAP! If not, he'll use Russian Roulette and who knows what kind
of results it'll bring. In case of petrifying Fatso can follow up with
Supercollider VS petrified girl, shattering her. Slim also packs bullets with
poison, silence and curse effects, but these aren't so annoying. Can't say the
same for death effect bullet, tho'. White mage is almost a must - her Esuna
will lift both petrify and poison. When you see Slim take defensive stance,
he's about to use Russian Roulette, so beware and be ready with right
countermeasures. Otherwise Slim hits for 60 damage and Fatso for 200 damage.
Heal your wounds if HP falls below 200!

If that's not enough, LB. comes equipped with Not-So-Mighty Guard and No Love
Lost, special triple tech, which can only be used if all LB., Fatso and Slim
are still alive. Extreme damage of about 300 to all will be inflicted. Pay
attention to what she's saying so that you know what will come flying in your
direction. Furthermore, she can haste her partners making them even more
deadly and is able to cure whole team with White Wind. How can you win this?

Fatso again has recognizable attack pattern of 'bash', 'bash', 'bash',
Supercollider, repeat. When extremely low on HP, he'll be using Huggles and
Concussive Blast a lot - former'll be aimed against the girl with lowest
current HP. LB. also has attack pattern, provided she's the last one standing
- 'fan slap', followed by two magic attacks, 'fan slap', Mach Fan and repeat.
Slim's actions cannot be predicted unfortunately.

As said, bring in white mage, songstress and warrior. Start by having white
mage cast Protect on everybody, then follow up with Cura/ga on all girls.
Songstress keeps using Darkness Dance - but make sure that you keep hear
health up at all times! Whoever has warrior DSP - start using various techs
against Slim, which must be eliminated first to ensure he won't annoy us with
KO or petrify. LB. usually starts the fight by casting Mighty Guard - dispel
the effects on your primary target first. Once Slim is gone, turn your
attention onto Fatso. When he falls too, all that's left is LB. She alone
can't stand much longer, so victory is yours.

INFILTRATE BEVELLE
New Yevon's headquarters: Bevelle. Does Vegnagun sleep deep beneath its
streets? Take the lift down and see!
Objective: Find Vegnagun
------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------

Depending on your decision of who you gave the sphere after storyline mission
5 affects the outcome of how this mission will unfold. If you've given the
sphere back to New Yevon, there won't be any battles here... yet. However, if
you gave the sphere to Youth League, you will have to battle with Bevelle
soldiers... To your left is SSP and Barkeep with his items.

Just keep going up fighting waves of soldiers (or not) and enter the door on
extreme N. Follow the path and enter another door so that you're inside 'New
Yevon HQ 1'. Go to 'New Yevon HQ 3' and climb the stone to trigger part of the
wall in 'New Yevon HQ 4' to fall off, which is where you should go next.
Inside climb the hole in the wall, drop down and examine *lower* pedestal.
This will cause the lift in 'New Yevon HQ 1' to transport you down below in
Bevelle temple to 'B - trials 1'. Ah, the memories again...

When in control, take the only route - a fight issues, which when won,
activates the rest of the path for you to explore. At 1stcross hike E and nail
two chests for 3x REMEDY and 3x REMEDY - when done, return to 1stcross and
take W path. At 2ndcross go S, nail the chest with 3000 GIL down there, return
to 2ndcross and take N path. At 3rdcross take W path, nail the chest with 4x
HI-POTION, back to 3rdcross and hike E. Get another two chests with 8x POTION
and 4x PHOENIX DOWN on the way, then hop onto a lift to reach 'B - trials 2'.
Now climb up the stairs and go right to 'B - antechamber'. Restock at Barkeep
if you need anything, bang the chest open for CHOCOBO FEATHER, save at SSP,
then proceed right to next room.

After the scene you'll be deeper inside Bevelle temple. Go right to trigger
another scene. When it's finished, you can go examine a pedestal on the
balcony you're currently on for some hints on how does security work.

Passage to the lower sanctum is blocked. Manually disable the security system
to proceed. Use the three control towers with blue lights to disable the
security system. But be careful! The towers with red lights are set to defense
mode!

Talk to LB. and she'll clue you in on how can you reach middle platform - walk
to N end of balcony and approach the edge in order for Yuna to slide down the
chain. Take down two robots in next battle. If you want Ribbon, FOLLOW THESE
INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY AS TOLD!

You'll be standing near one of six towers. This tower will be referred to as
T1. Counting in anti-clockwise direction the rest will be dubbed T2, T3, T4,
T5 and T6. Start the dance by taking stairs leading to T1 and activating it -
you'll need to defeat a robot in battle that will issue straight away.
<Security lockout 1 of 3 disabled.> 1st plate is ejected and put into place.
After victory go up, skip T2 and activate T3 - take down another robot.
<Security lockout 2 of 3 disabled.> 3rd plate is ejected and put into place.
Now skip T4 and activate T5. Hi there!

10. [Anti-Dressphere] - VS one chr - phd, induces itchy
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
Another leftover from before, Precepts Guard is a bit tougher. It loves to
start the battle by KO-ing one of the girls with Death - counter this with
quick Phoenix Down. You have a 50% chance of PG using one of its not-so-
damaging moves - Bio and Demi can't kill you (cure the former with Antidote),
Drain steals about 50 HP, and Osmose can be laughed at. Slow is a problem,
tho'. Counter the effects with white mage's Esuna or consider using Remedies.

Now the usual stuff can be applied: white mage with two warriors is excellent
choice. Warriors start with Armor and Magic Breaks, while white mage ensures
party stays healthy - if you've been fluently practicing white magic, you
should now already have Reflect, Protect, Shell, Regen and Curaga. For fun try
casting Reflect on yourselves. Keep at damaging PG, taking care to revive KO-
ed girls and not to let your guard down. PG is another thing of the past.

OS battle mode activated? Okay, time to enter the fray. First message that'll
pop up and make you wonder is Magic Catalyst. This means that longer battle
draws on, higher PG's MAG will become. This is why you don't want to linger
around for too long (no, you can't Magic Break PG). In OSF PG doesn't know any
of its weak magics, but instead gains ability to attack girls physically and
use elemental MATK. Cure the former with protect, and set reflect for latter -
making PG hit itself is priceless. If you're hit with Anti-Dressphere move, no
worries - just toss Esuna, Remedy or change DSP (I like to do the last
option).
*****************************************************************************

<Security system disabled. Passageway to lower sanctum now accessible.> 2nd
plate is ejected and put into place. Now that access to entrance down in the
pit is granted, don't hop down just yet! We gotta get ourselves a Ribbon! Now
activate T6 and kill next robot. 4th plate (controled by T6) will emerge in
the pit. Now approach T1 and kill PG four times. Activating T2 is your next
objective - kill another robot too! T2 controls 6th plate, which will emerge
now. Back to T1 and kill PG two times. Finally activate T4...

4. Osmose - VS one chr - MP stolen is added to Geo's MP
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
Geo is much more dangerous than PG - it has four element MATK at its disposal
and it uses them mercilessly. Getting KO-ed here is no big surprise. However,
you can tip the odds in your favour by simply making three white mages and
casting Reflect on yourself. Bye, Geo, I hope to fight you sometime soon
again. Or have white mage and two warriors - white mage casts Shell on all
girls, then Cura/ga on all and keeps at it. Warriors Magic Break Geo to lessen
mgd it can do - all that will make Geo manageable. Geo is one of the bosses
that would like to have its MP back s

In case you haven't learned Reflect yet, there is one other way too. Prior to
battle maximize girls' MDEF as high as you can. 80% of the time Geo will use
element MATK, so apply shell status as well if you see you're still taking the
beating. In case Geo becomes oversouled, you'll be seeing its PATK as well, so
apply that protect status. Geo can be slowed as well - this reduces damage you
would be taking even further. Claim your victory!

OSF battle mode activated? Okay, time to enter the fray. First message that'll
pop up and make you wonder is Power Catalyst. This means that longer battle
draws on, higher Geo's STR will become - although I wonder why. Geo relies
heavily on lv3 element magics, so Magic Catalyst would be more suited for it.
As I wrote, four elements are Geo's forte, so you'll be well off with stuff
that reduces or nullifies element damage. Or casting reflect... luckily Geo is
stupid enough not to know Dispel.

Checking its status weaknesses it isn't immune to slow and Magic Break, which
is one of primary things you should focus on in the battle, should you wish to
emerge victorious. Be aware that Geo's 'punch' hits all girls, not just one -
it's used fairly frequently, so healing on regular bases is also one of things
you mustn't forget to do.
*****************************************************************************

Defeating Geo will spit out 5th plate (which is controled by T4) - now either
approach T3 and kill Geo three times, or kill PG three times at T1, choice is
yours. Circle of 'life' has been completed. Hop via the plates all the way
down and take the entrance. You'll find RIBBON ACC in lone chest here. Go back
all the way up to six towers. Behind T2 is a chain leading to one more chest
with 500 GIL. Same deal is with T3 (along with chest with GLASS BUCKLE ACC
there's a robot fight) and T5 (again, a robot fight and a chest with PEARL
NECKLACE ACC).

roomofshadows comments: If you neglected (or didn't want to) getting the Ribbon
at this chance, know that you can return for it later. Here's how you can
proceed about getting it - activate the towers in any order you choose. As
previously mentioned, after fighting PG and Geo, you may choose to fight them
again and again. First enter the corridor you are supposed to continue with,
then run back out; this resets the plate that is activated. Fighting Geo at T3
will shuffle the fourth plate counterclockwise, one space for each optional
fight you engage in. Fight him until the fourth plate is one space to the left
of the third (so that you basically continue the staircase downward). Touch the
door of T4, then go back to T3 and fight Geo again. The fifth plate moves
counterclockwise one space. Continue until it is one space to the left of the
fourth plate. Touching the door of T2 will allow you to move the sixth (bottom)
plate, until it is in front of the annex where you get Ribbon.

If you want some fights with high EXP and a bit of hassle on your side, now's
your chance. Examining T1 repeatedly allows you to fight PG indefinitely,
while T3 ensures fights against Geo. Getting to LV30 will be successful in no
time. Oh, I should warn you that both Georapella and PG can enter oversoul
when killed certain amount of times, so do be on your toes - going to save
every so often is not a bad idea. Patrick L. has informed me about stealing
Recovery Bracer from oversouled PG - a nice way of getting Auto-Regen early in
the game. CheesyPuffs suggests to steal Short Circuit from oversouled Geo.
When you have the feeling you have enough, leave this area by leaping down to
3rd plate and entering another part of Bevelle temple, called 'B - labyrinth'.

You're right, another straighforward path. Drop down, then climb twice to open
the chest for 4x ETHER. Drop down, continue N and climb some more, then jump
over to next ledge. As you drop down, open another chest somewhat hidden here
- it contains 4x REMEDY. At 1stcross take E path.

You'll be in next part of corridor - as you get to the chasm, step on middle
pillar to cause a lift to appear. Use it and it will carry you across. You'll
appear at lower levels of 'B - restricted'. Get the chest here which contains
DOWNTRODDER GG, then return via the lift to 1st cross in 'B - labyrinth' and
take W path.

Climb either left or right pillar. Then climb whichever pillar *you didn't
climb first* to gain access to further parts of Bevelle temple. You'll be in
'B - gaol', a room with a gigantic machine. Open the chest in NW corner of the
room for 5x PHOENIX DOWN, then go to where Fatso and Slim are standing. From
this position go SW until Yuna falls off ledge to a big platform with switch
plate. Step on it to stop the gaol. Step on switch again to get gaol moving -
now watch the pistons.

Wait until one of them rotates into position so that it will be aligned with
Fatso and Slim. If piston falls down so that piston's top is just above the
floor level where Fatso and Slim are standing, step on the switch to stop the
gao. Now climb onto the piston and go up the ramp.

You will need to press Square to signal Rikku to operate the pistons. You can
only call Rikku when Yuna is standing in a safe place - safe place being one
of many ledges on the back wall.

Look at pistons' positions. Only two of them can point toward back wall at any
given time. I'll refer to them as left-rear piston and right-rear piston. But
the process will be real easy anyway. Piston can be in highest, middle or
lowest position.

Okies, with Yuna jump to one of the ledges in the back and press Square.
Pistons will start to move - pay attention to the two pistons that will become
rear-left piston and rear-right piston for now. As soon as left-rear piston
rises to highest level and rear-right piston is on middle level, press Square
again. Jump on rear-right piston, climb the ramp onto rear-left piston and use
it to jump on the ledge of back wall, where a chest with BLOODLUST ACC can be
found.

Square again. This time wait for rear-left piston to be on highest level, and
rear-right piston to be on lowest level. Make your way to rear-right piston,
jump on the ledge, thru the door to 'B - restricted', where a chest with WRING
ACC awaits your girls.

Now how to get back? Square to Rikku - wait until either of rear pistons is on
lowest level - this is where you press Square again. Now jump on either
piston, make your way to front piston's top and simply jump down. Go W now to
reach 'B - laybrinth 2'.

Approach the wall which will fall away. Ahead you see three lifts. Use left
one first - on upper level climb both elevations to get access to final lift
up here (open the chest for HI-POTION). Now go S all the way until you fall
down. Use N lift now to be transported to elevated switch - climb onto it and
two pillars will rise somewhere. Go back down, and now ride right lift to
upper level. Take left lift back down to lower level. Use N lift again and you
get access to another elevated switch - climb onto it and you have now
complete access to dark knight DSP. Use the lift to ride back down, then use
left lift to go back up to upper level. Finally use top lift here to get even
higher...

In case the above paragraph makes you go ?????, follow this URL:
http://groups.msn.com/SplitInfinity/darkknightdressphere.msnw

Up here use the pillars you've been rising to collect DARK KNIGHT DSP, then
save your game at handy SSP. Use platforms on the right to cross the gap and
prepare yourself...

BOSS STRATEGY
A challenging boss indeed. Too bad we're overleveled thanks to Geo and PG
trick not long back. If you still get owned, level up a bit more. But with
your latest dark knight outfit you should have little to no problems.
Mr B.'s attacks hit for 200 damage a pop (he's capable of launching multiple
PATK as a single command, so beware). Demi can't kill you, but Looming
Glacier's ability to stop your girls as well as completely obliterate their MP
is annoying. Stopproof acc is useful here (or thief DSP with Stopproof PASA) -
if you have no means of preventing stop, you'll need to use Esuna or Remedy to
remove it. Do not ignore stop status or you will be sorry - counteract
immediately.

Don't get too crowded near him or else his Glint will hurt all three girls -
to avoid that you might want to consider using long range jobs such as gunner,
gun mage or alchemist. A nice way to start the battle is having a girl change
into white mage and cast Shell and Protect - that way you'll greatly reduce
damage he's dealing to your team. Anyway, since Ethers aren't exactly
excessive and you prolly don't have much with you, plus he loves to lower or
empty your MP, rely solely on PATK. Beware his Drill Shot! If target's HP
isn't above 75% MAX HP, girl will be KO-ed and you'll need to do some reviving
- luckily damage can be halved with protect. Drill Shot is used after Mr B.'s
HP has been changed 10 times - that means if he is attacked ten times, he'll
use Drill Shot against the girl who used that 10th attack.

To ensure damage will be given to him, you may wish to employ dark knight's
Darkness - at expense of some HP Mr B. is guaranteed to take damage. Use Hi-
Potions to heal your wounds... soon you'll be able to buy them (if not already
thanks to O'aka), so go all out.

5. Impulse - FRATT VS all chrs - fractional std, tears off 37,5% of current HP
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
First of the bunch and also the easiest. To get you started, here's its attack
pattern: Curse or 'smash', 'smash', 'smash', Impulse, Impulse, countdown, Mega
Flare. Rinse and repeat until defeated. I know you are taken by surprise
(hell, I was, since I know what happened to aeons at end of FFX), but Dark B.
is not hard at all.

Smash hits for 120 damage, Curse and Countdown can't kill you, Impulse is
gravity based attack (dependant on *current* HP), and Mega Flare does about
500 damage. Problems with all that? Naaah. Bring in white mage and two dark
knights. Have white mage Protect everybody, then keep up Cura/ga-on-all-girls
tech, while dark knights slowly chip away at Dark B.'s health. BTW, damage
done by Impulse cannot be reduced, but it doesn't matter anyway, since attack
itself can't kill you.

After you see Dark B. launch third 'smash' (meaning his next attack will be
Impulse) you can go all out. For next seven B.'s turns you will NOT be KO-ed.
Just before B. unleashes Mega Flare, ensure that your HP is at least above 700
- else meet the infamous KO. Remember not to be scared of B.'s attacks cos
they're not as powerful as you may think.

Before selecting your next destination, back out! If O'aka has paid off his
debt, a message will pop out telling you so and informing you that he's headed
for Macalania. On board of Celsius someone has resupplied chests in engine
room, so loot all four of them again. If you have neglected getting O'aka
onboard in CH1, fret no more - shop finally sells Hi-Potions...

While you're still in the cabin, also make sure that you choose [Rest.] when
you talk to Barkeep. Don't forget to raid the chests in 'C - engine r.' for 6x
PHOENIX DOWN, 3x ETHER, 5x REMEDY and 4x HI-POTION. When you've done
everything you could aboard Celsius, go back to the bridge. I bet you've seen
a strange sphere placed near Shinra's seat? This is a CommSphere. By visiting
all locations in CH3 this will prompt Shinra to tag along and plant CommSphere
at a certain place - please note that just visiting the area won't be enough
sometimes; you'll need to visit correct spot in the area too. Now talk to MN
and three HS will appear. Don't go to any of them yet!!!

Third opportunity of completing bonus stuff is at your disposal. Don't want to

                   such missions.
Sidequest No.    - Denotes sidequest is available in target area.
                   [...] parenthesis denote that sidequest is 'hidden', ie
                   you can't see it on NavMap screen. You need to beam down
                   to target area and find the trigger which allows you to
                   start the mission.
Treasure         - Visit the area and free the contents of all chests.*
Scene            - Area worth visiting for few extra scenes.
PR Mission       - Most extensive sidequest IMO. Triggered in CH1 and lasts
                   whole game. Simply play minigames and lose credits.
Bride Mission    - Another extensive sidequest. Not worth your time IMO.

*   - Even though not indicated, all of the 15 areas you can visit contain

ITEMS
- Outskirts - 3x Lunar Curtain
- Square - 5x Reptile Coin, 5x Bird Coin, 5x Wasp Coin, 5x Ahriman Coin, White
Signet GG*, Treasure Hunt GG*, Lady Luck DSP
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENEMIES: None.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* - these two GG are obtained if you manage to swipe border coin with Item
trait; in four times I got them, GG was always first item awarded, so I can
safely assume that if you manage to chain border coin with Item trait, you'll
get GG
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

As soon as you enter Luca, scene occurs. Sphere Break contest! And there's an
awesome DSP to be won, which of course is what we want. Goooo, Yuna!

After scene is finished, you're given these coins: 5x REPTILE COIN, 5x BIRD
COIN, 5x WASP COIN and 5x AHRIMAN COIN. Yuna will be standing in 'Square' - to
your right you'll see Shelinda, Rin and a kid wearing a beak. Talk to him to
rewise Sphere Break rules or tournament rules.

Here's a short recap of tournament rules:
- you can only use coins prescribed for the tournament
- you must win three matches to advance
- you can't play against same person more than once
- if you lose three matches, you're out

A couple of easy opponents include guy walking around in 'Square' - this guy
has Fresh Catch core sphere. Second opponent that is fairly easy is an old guy
sitting down on 'Bridge'. After you waste them both, SAVE YOUR GAME! Now comes
the somewhat hard part - your attempt is to win White Signet GG, Treasure Hunt
GG and lady luck DSP as an added bonus.

To get first of aforementioned GG, you'll need to challenge woman with the
dog, sitting on a bench to the left of the status on 'Square' - she's only
available for playing if you've won two games. You will have 15 turns to meet
40 quota. Advice? Keep checking border coins to see if there's one that has
Item trait. If there is, make sure you include it in one of the chains ASAP -
doing so will net you WHITE SIGNET GG. NOW MAKE SURE YOU LOSE THE GAME! Simply
let the timer run out or whatever. Save your game again - well, you got one GG
already.

Now seek out third easy opponent to be wasted - how about blond guy leaning
against NW wall in 'Square'? After you waste him, it's time to face the
champion - 'It's elementary really, once you get the hang of it.' Yuna'll make
you eat those words. As with the dog before, this match is very similar, but
with few differences: you have 15 turns to meet 50 quota, and chances of
getting core sphere of 1 is also very high. Again, make use of two coin echoes
- if you're lucky enough not to get core sphere of 1, you'll win by 12th turn
or so. Also, make sure to check border coins for Item trait - if there is one,
include it in a chain to get TREASURE HUNT GG. If you win, Yuna also receives
LADY LUCK DSP.

'My goggles fogged up.' Sure they did, hehe. Just a reminder - should you lose
and don't wish to be bothered by Sphere Break, you forfeit lady luck DSP for
now. You can try to get it again in CH5 by challenging Shinra, who will be in
Luca in one of the basements, only this time you'll have to win in 15 turns
and meet 100 quota.

What's there left to do? In 'Outskirts' make a jump to the chest to get 3x
LUNAR CURTAIN. And how about revisiting 'T - reception' to purchase new movie
and music spheres? Shinra's CommSphere is installed just by visiting Luca.

------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------
MACHINA MAYHEM!
The machina deployed along the Mi'ihen Highroad have started attacking
innocent people. Take out the misbehaving machina and restore peace to the
Highroad!
Objective: Incapacitate 13 tandems of machina
------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------

Machines are outta control? Who's gonna stop them? Worry not, Yuna's here! As
soon as you enter the area, option is presented. Select top choice to start
the mission. Be careful, for there is another group involved in destroying the
machines. In order to have this mission accomplished, amount of machines
destroyed by YRP must be higher than the amount of machines destroyed by other
group (score is kept for viewing in lower right corner). If you manage to do
that, rewards are quite handsome.

You can choose your starting point like this: if you beam down with the
airship, you'll start at 'Highroad - S end'; but if you enter from Mushroom
side, you will begin the mission in 'Highroad, N end'. I definitely recommend
starting at S end.

So, start the mission at S-most end of Mi'ihen road - look at your minimap
closely - each green square spotted means that there's a machine gone crazy
and needs to be destroyed for further examination. In total there's 13 groups
of crazy machines scattered over Mi'ihen - three fights on 'Highroad - S end',
one fight on 'Highroad - S', three fights on 'Highroad - central', none on
'Highroad - agency, front', three on 'Highroad - oldroad, S', three on
'Highroad - newroad, N' (here, MAKE SURE THAT YOU ATTACK machina located
nearest to the exit to 'Highroad - N end', as it is vastly important for
getting an awesome acc in CH5; access to both fights is granted by holding
down Circle so that Yuna jumps to the place of encounter).

If you make sure you aren't stopping for too long, you'll have dismantled 10
sets of machina tops. You must, however, whack at least 7 sets, one of those
sets being the machina I explicitly mention in above paragraph.

Once 13th machine group is destroyed and if your girls have managed to whack
at least 7 groups, girls receive 10000 GIL, UNDYING STORM GG and MISSION
ACCOMPLISHED!

Once you finish the mission, go to 'Highroad - newroad, N' and find Shinra
here. Approach him so that he mentions sth about CommSpheres (again, MUCHO
IMPORTANTO for CH5)... As far as items go, everything listed in item checklist
can be found in chests. Also, make sure to visit 'H - agency, front' to ensure
Shinra installs a CommSphere there.

If you've given the sphere to Youth League in CH2, Mushroom will be one of the
HS in this CH. But if you've given the sphere back to New Yevon, there won't
be any HS in Mushroom. Still, visiting Mushroom is important for adding % to
your completion. When you enter the area, go to where read arrow in minimap is
pointing. You'll see Shinra planting a CommSphere in front of the entrance to
Mushroom, but later he runs off past the blockade - this sets the CommSphere.
A scene with Yaibal and Lucil will be triggered. Now visit N part of this
screen where the stone lift is - use it to reach the chest with 2000 GIL.
Finally head over to to Djose temple (do not worry, this will NOT trigger
storyline mission 11!) to have another with white-haired boy - BUT YOU HAVE TO
DO THIS BEFORE COMPLETING STORYLINE MISSIONS AT KILIKA AND BESAID!

Going here should trigger storyline mission 11, but it doesn't. Why? You need
to complete storyline missions 9 and 10 first. Also, if you already witnessed
the scene from Mushroom before, you'll find Gippal in front of the entrance to
Djose temple. Approach him and you get AL BHED PRIMER KEY ITEM after the
scene. There's 3x PHOENIX DOWN to be grabbed in the chest on same screen, and
3x HI-POTION awaits you on 'D - p road'. When you'll be doing storyline
mission 11, Shinra's CommSphere will be installed automatically.

If you try to enter the door in NW corner of Guadosalam, a scene occurs, but
you *still* can't enter. Arrrgh! Enter the Chateau now and check 'Ch. - living
r' for a scene with Slim and Fatso. Afterwards go up the stairs in 'Ch. -
private q' and check on LB. Back to the room with Slim and Fatso - go to them
to trigger next scene.

Hey look! The passage to 'Ch - hidden pass' is open - let's check it out!
Proceed thru the hallway until you reach SSP - turn left and thru the circular
door - open the chest for TETRA BAND ACC. Now take a look at minimap - see how
there's a shape of 'C' letter around the room where you're in? And at the base
it seems to be connected? That's your clue - directions provided now are based
on minimap. Have Yuna turn S and climb stack of boxes by holding Circle. Climb
up higher once more and you'll be on the catwalk. Make it all the way around
and storm the chest for CRIMSON SPHERE 4 KEY ITEM (make sure you watch it as
soon as you're aboard Celsius!).

Remember the room where you fought Slim and Fatso? Check it out again and
another scene will unfold. You will score LOGOS' SPHERE and ORMI'S SPHERE KEY
ITEM-s. Go to the place Slim was checking before for two spheres and press X
for another scene and GAOL SPHERE KEY ITEM. Then approach the chatterbox and
pick [Please, go on.] for bla bla bla...

Not much... if you haven't completed the tower minigame from CH2, now your
second chance to do so - remember, for calibrating at least five towers you
get Samurai's Honor GG. Items mentioned in item checklist are all found in
chests, so get to stealing from them. Shinra's CommSphere will be installed
when you visit 'TP - south'.

Regarding Cid two possible events can occur (look for purple X on minimap):
- If you've picked [Not really.] when talking to Cid in CH1, he'll appear in
'TP - south' just before you cross to 'TP - north'. Have a chat with him.
- If you've picked [You bet I do!] when talking to Cid in CH1 AND have talked
to him when visiting Thunder p. in CH2, he'll appear in 'TP - south' somewhere
between second and third tower. Talk to him.

One more issue can be taken care of... remember two Ronso kids you met in Calm
lands in CH2? They're located in N Thunder p. now almost at the end under the
shelter in NW corner - you really can't miss them as they're also marked with
purple X in minimap. Have a chat with them too and pick top option when given
choice (you can choose between [Djose Temple.], [The Moonflow.] and [Kilika
Island.]. Note that if you haven't met them in Calm lands before in CH2, they
*will not* appear here.

Your choice of where to send two young Ronsos doesn't affect your game much.
It will only affect the place they will appear at in CH4.

And lastly shop's goods...

If you beam down, mission starts immediately, otherwise it will be triggered
when you jog into 'Lake Mac. - agency f' (just remember O'aka mission from CH1
and you'll know where to go).

------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------
SECURE THE AGENCY!
Rout the fiends that have attacked the Travel Agency! There's no time to heal
between battles, so you'll just have to withstand them all!
Objective: Win six consecutive battles
------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------

You will need to fight six consecutive battles, so make sure you're well
prepared! If you think you can't handle next enemies or need to heal in
between, you're given a choice between each bout - pick [Fight!] to continue
fighting, or [Flee.] to be given an option to heal - in latter case girls
withdraw to 'MW - lake road', where you can regroup. Beware, you have about
three seconds to decide - if you don't select anything on your own, next
battle will issue automatically. Finish all six rounds and you get this loot:
BERSERKER DSP, PRIDE OF THE SWORD GG, AL BHED PRIMER KEY ITEM and MISSION
ACCOMPLISHED! There's also a chest here with X-POTION.

Here's battle set-ups you'll be fighting:
1st and 4th battle VS Rhyos & Vertigo
2nd and 5th battle VS 3x Barbuta
3rd and 6th battke VS Barbuta & Flan Blanco

When you're done with the mission and if you have gotten O'aka onboard Celsius
in CH1 and paid off his whole debt before end of CH2, you will see him run
into the shop after you have received your rewards. Exit the agency any try to
leave for another scene.

Now go to 'MW - spring 2' - if you have accomplished sidequest mission Head to
the already known X cross and take NE exit - talk with all three small
musicians for something to appear. Examine this with X for HOWLING WIND GG.
And finally, you can storm one chest with NULFROST RING ACC in 'MW - central
1', while GOLD BRACER ACC awaits you in a chect in 'MW - central 2'.

Now, let's delve into details about Macalania's shop outpost destiny. There's
a few possible destinies that this shop will see:
- you got O'aka onboard Celsius in CH1 or CH2, paid off his debt before CH2
  ended - shop remains closed for duration of CH3, but reopens in CH5 under
  O'aka's management
- you got O'aka onboard Celsius in CH1 or CH2, but didn't pay off his debt
  before CH2 ended - shop remains closed for duration of CH3, but reopens in
  CH5 under Al Bhed management with a rather crummy list of items and acc
- you handed O'aka to Al Bhed in CH1 or CH2, and then found him digging in
  Bikanel in CH2 - shop remains closed for duration of CH3, but reopens in
  CH5 under O'aka's management
- you handed O'aka to Al Bhed in CH1 or CH2, but didn't find him digging in
  Bikanel in CH2 - shop remains closed for duration of CH3, but reopens in

There's two Shinra's CommSphere to be installed here - one in front of the
agency (after completing the subquest go to Macarena lake again to make sure
it was installed), and the other in the vicinity of SSP in 'MW - south'.

Cactuars? Yay! Needles! Lots of them! Okay, when scene is over, talk with the
pilot near Picket and choose [Cactuar Nation]. Another scene will follow -
MAKE SURE YOU PICK [That makes perfect sense!]... afterwards approach Marnela
and press X to start the mission!

------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------
THE CACTUAR CONNECTION
The Ten Gatekeepers have ventured into the world proper to train. Round them
up and bring them home to the Cactuar Nation! Think you can unravel the
Cactuar Mothers' clues and sniff them out?
Objective: Find the Ten Gatekeepers
------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------

Until you complete it, there will be HS over Bikanel. For this CH we can only
go up until Cactuar numero six. Cactuar hunter minigame is now in session!
These guys are now hiding all over Spira, making your hunt even more futile.
Nooo! Fret not, you have me to uncover all the secrets there are.:)

To start, pay attention to minimap. Cacti that give clues to Cactuar's
whereabouts are marked as green squares and give off a green aura (please note
that N-most green cactus isn't important yet!). Carefully look at the hints
given and try to figure out where the hell it's hiding (or just look below).
When you want to leave this part of the desert, go to NE corner, examine the
vehicle and select [Yeah, it's time we left.].

1st: Back in Al Bhed Camp, talk to the pilot and select [Oasis]. Cactuar is
     here. But BEFORE you touch it, talk to the Hypello (if it appears, that
     is - if it doesn't, just go on with the game), for it sells some awesome
     acc (list of goods is found below). Now touch the Cactuar and complete
     the minigame (doesn't matter if you win) and needles are yours. Now that
     you have it, return to Al Bhed camp, talk to pilot again and this time
     select [Cactuar Nation]. Back in cactus area approach the green boxed
     one and talk with it to officially confirm the catch. Now another cactus
     will turn green... talk to it and onto 2nd Cactuar.
2nd: You'll need to pay a visit to 'B - beach' (as long as you don't enter
     the village, storyline mission will wait). Cactuar is taking a sunbath
     there - make sure you make a drop on it!
3rd: Guadosalam is your third destination. Enter the Chateau and go into the
     secret area where you had your last fights against the Syndicate. In one
     of the rooms you'll spot a funny chest... if you shoot the chests during
     this cact-war, you may receive an item!
4th: Calm lands - bridge between Gagazet and Calm lands screen. Here you'll
     find two Cactuars riding on a chocobo...
5th: Same as 4th Cactuar.
6th: N-most end of 'TP - north'. There's a shelter-like structure found in
     this area - look for Cactuar stone opposite of it. What's that green
     shining nearby? This is as far as we can go for this CH.

There's a shoopuf caravan that may occassionally appear in Oasis...

* - only if you've sided with New Yevon and BEFORE you complete storyline
missions 9 and 10
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Again, based on your decision of who will you give the sphere back to at start
of CH2, two routes are possible:

- if you gave the sphere to New Yevon, there's a HS pointing over Bevelle.
When you set foot in the area, go N thru the door, then keep walking until you
witness a scene. Back on board of Celsius beam to Bevelle again and go all the
way to the place where you fought 'impulsive' boss. Here address Pacce to
trigger a scene - when option is presented, pick [Go for it!] to receive BLOOD
OF THE BEAST GG; this is the only way to receive this GG

- if you gave the sphere to Youth League, only portion of Bevelle available
for exploring is 'Highbridge'

OTHER REFERENCES: STUFF007
Did you know that one more thing can be taken care of? Read on - after you
complete both storyline missions 9 and 10 (and REGARDLESS of who you sided
with), but BEFORE you tackle storyline mission 11, return to Bevelle yet
again. A scene with a known face will be played - enter 'New Yevon HQ 1' and
ride the lift up. Here go past three old geezers thru now open door to reach
'B - central, catwalk'. Talk to two monks here to receive ELECTROCUTIONER ACC
and HYPNO CROWN ACC.

Now visit 'New Yevon HQ 4' and examine bottom pedestal - lift in 'New Yevon HQ
1' will now take you to 'B - trials 1'. In here storm six chests for OATH VEIL
ACC, 5000 GIL, 4x REMEDY, 9x POTION, 5x PHOENIX DOWN and 5x HI-POTION. Proceed
making your way deeper - in 'B - antechamber' save your game and open the
chest for 2x CHOCOBO FEATHER.

In 'B - restricted' area (which you access once you jump thru the hole in 'B -
fayth chamber') walk to N end of balcony and approach the edge in order for
Yuna to slide down the chain. If you didn't get it in CH2 and you want Ribbon,
FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY AS TOLD!

Three uppermost plates are already activated, as you were descending here back
in CH2. You'll be standing near one of six towers. This tower will be referred
to as T1. Counting in anti-clockwise direction the rest will be dubbed T2, T3,
T4, T5 and T6. Towers you already must've activated are T1, T3 and T5.

Now that access to entrance down in the pit is granted, don't hop down just
yet! We gotta get ourselves a Ribbon! Now activate T6 and kill next robot. 4th
plate (controled by T6) will emerge in the pit. Now approach T1 and kill PG
four times. Activating T2 is your next objective - kill another robot too! T2
controls 6th plate, which will emerge now. Back to T1 and kill PG two times.
Finally activate T4...

Defeating Geo will spit out 5th plate (which is controled by T4) - now either
approach T3 and kill Geo three times, or kill PG three times at T1, choice is
yours. Circle of 'life' has been completed. Hop via the plates all the way
down and take the entrance. You'll find Ribbon acc in lone chest here. Go back
all the way up to six towers. Behind T2 is a chain leading to one more chest
with 800 GIL. Same deal is with T3 (along with chest with FAERIE EARRINGS ACC
there's a robot fight) and T5 (again, a robot fight and a chest with BEADED
BROOCH ACC).

When you have the feeling you have enough, leave this area by leaping down to
3rd plate and entering another part of Bevelle temple, called 'B - labyrinth'.
You're right, another straighforward path. Drop down, then climb twice to open
the chest for 5x ETHER. Drop down, continue N and climb some more, then jump
over to next ledge. As you drop down, open another chest somewhat hidden here
- it contains 5x REMEDY. At 1stcross take W path... or in case you haven't yet
nabbed Downtrodder GG at the end of E path, get it now (if you already got
this GG from the chest in earlier CH, shest disappears).

Climb either left or right pillar. Then climb whichever pillar *you didn't
climb first* to gain access to further parts of Bevelle temple. You'll be in
'B - gaol', a room with a gigantic machine of sorts. Open the chest in NW
corner of the room for 6x PHOENIX DOWN.

Read this and next couple of paragraphs if you skipped getting Bloodlust and
Wring acc in CH2 - contributors Debremus and kokoro comment that Bloodlust
chest is still here for taking. Go to where Fatso and Slim were standing in
CH2 (remember?). From this position go SW until Yuna falls off ledge to a big
platform with switch plate. Step on it to stop the gaol. Step on switch again
to get gaol moving - now watch the pistons.

Wait until one of them rotates into position so that it will be aligned with
Fatso and Slim. If piston falls down so that piston's top is just above the
floor level where Fatso and Slim are standing, step on the switch to stop the
gaol. Now climb onto the piston and go up the ramp.

You will need to press Square to signal Rikku to operate the pistons. You can
only call Rikku when Yuna is standing in a safe place - safe place being one
of many ledges on the back wall.

Look at pistons' positions. Only two of them can point toward back wall at any
given time. I'll refer to them as left-rear piston and right-rear piston. But
the process will be real easy anyway. Piston can be in highest, middle or
lowest position.

Okies, with Yuna jump to one of the ledges in the back and press Square.
Pistons will start to move - pay attention to the piston that will become
rear-left piston and rear-right pistons for now. As soon as left-rear piston
rises to highest level and rear-right piston is on middle level, press Square
again. Jump on rear-right piston, climb the ramp onto rear-left piston and use
it to jump on the ledge of back wall, where a chest with Bloodlust acc can be
found.

Square again. This time wait for rear-left piston to be on highest level, and
rear-right piston to be on lowest level. Make your way to rear-right piston,
jump un the ledge, thru the door to 'B - restricted', where a chest with Wring
acc awaits your girls.

Now how to get back? Square to Rikku - wait until either of rear pistons is on
lowest level - this is where you press Square again. Now jump on either
piston, make your way to front piston's top and simply jump down. Go W now to
reach 'B - laybrinth 2'. If you skipped getting dark knight DSP in CH2, now's
your second chance - follow these instructions exactly.

Approach the wall which will fall away. Ahead you see three lifts. Use left
one first - on upper level climb both elevations to get access to final lift
up here (open the chest for REMEDY). Now go S all the way until you fall down.
Use N lift now to be transported to elevated switch - climb onto it and two
pillars will rise somewhere. Go back down, and now ride right lift to upper
level. Take left lift back down to lower level. Use N lift again and you get
access to another elevated switch - climb onto it and you have now complete
access to dark knight DSP. Use the lift to ride back down, then use left lift
to go back up to upper level. Finally use top lift here to get even higher...

Up here use the pillars you've been rising to collect dark knight DSP, then
save your game at handy SSP. Use platforms on the right to cross the gap and
prepare yourself...

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
Why hello there, it sure is nice meeting you... aaaah, it's da Malboro! Run or
Bad Breath gets you! Jobs of choice is white mage with dark knights who have
mastered anti-status PASA, which will ensure they're afflicted with as less
statuses as possible. Believe it or not, but this Malboro is quite easy to be
killed - two facts speak for that.

First is that it can only attack one girl at a time, and second is that it
uses Bad Breath after sustaining damage for 10 times (on all other turns it
will use 'squirt'). Even so, be advised - 'squirt' inflicts four breaks on
your girls, so longer you take to kill it, bigger the damage you'll be
receiving and lesser the damage you'll be giving.

When checking status immunities for this guy, you may notice that it can be
afflicted with darkness. Big deal, for even with max EVA you will still take
hits. But you can inflict all breaks on it, thus making your battle at least
somewhat easier. Let's rock finally.

As battle initiates, white mage casts Protect, then switch her into third dark
knight and keep attacking mercilessly. Weed must die before you attack it for
10th time, or else Bad Breath is imminent on Malboro's next turn, in which
case just hope it doesn't affect your girls in too much ways. If you get
berserked, that's good, but it's not good if you get confused. Should latter
be the case, Esuna or Remedy immediately. If Malboro manages to pile the
breaks onto your girls all the way to 10th level, there's one drastic measure
you can try - KO such girl and revive her for all breaks to be gone.

In case Malboro is OSF, your item stock becomes possible target area. Malboro
gains the ability to destroy your Eye Drops and Antidotes in a flash. In
addition, its Halitosis will force you to constantly switch DSP (equip
Favorite Outfit to be Itchproof), possibly making you forget to lead the
battle at hand. Do not allow that - Malboro may only be a slightly harder.
Okay, so you may no longer predict when Bad Breath will be used, but hey,
where'd the challenge be then?

'Chomp' inflicts huge damage, so protect being in place is a wise decision.
BTW, you cannot evade it, for it always hits. Don't worry about your item
stock, though - all of the items that can get possibly destroyed can easily be
bought later. Malboro is still susceptible to both slow and all seven status
breaks. Luckily for you, it has lost the ability to pile up status breaks on
you.

There's 15 people trapped inside the cave. Your objective is to find them and
bring them safely out of the cave. I'll describe a way in which you will make
four trips total inside the cave. To make it harder on you, each person you'll
talk to will inform you of some stupid crap they prefer or dislike. Who cares
about that... simply follow this guidelines here and you'll be finished in no
time. To have it easy on directions, pay attention to minimap as I will be
using it for reference!

As you enter, go N and you'll be in 1st room with non-functional teleport pad.
Go E and at 1stcross go E again to locate 1st person. Back to 1stcross and now
go N to reach 2nd room and 2nd person. Further N is 2ndcross and 3rd person.
Go W for now and pay attention - mash X as soon 4th person will come running.
If you miss him, return to 2nd room and collect him. Now go back to 1st room
to clear the 'luggage'. You will receive ENERGY CORE 1 and ENERGY CORE 2.

Back to 2ndcross now hike E to 3rd room, where you will collect 5th, 6th and
7th person - also nab WHITE RING ACC. Again back to 2ndcross, go W and at
3rdcross go E to find 8th person. At 3rdcross now go N and you will find 9th
and 10th person as well as BLUE RING ACC. Back to 1st room to clear another
'luggage'. You will receive ENERGY CORE 3 and ENERGY CORE 4.

Now return to 3rdcross and go W to reach 4thcross. Go W again and mash X to
find 11th person, which is 'hiding' behind the wall. Follow two kids that have
escaped via E path of 4thcross into 4th room - you'll find them kneeling
towards N end of 4th room (this accounts 12th and 13th person). Take them all
back to the entrance - you receive ENERGY CORE 5 and ENERGY CORE 6. But this
time you should go out as well.

Outside talk to one of the guys staring at the entrance to receive an ENERGY
CORE 7, which will help you find last two people still stuck in the cave. Use
the teleport in 1st room to reach 4th room. Now face E side and step on
teleport to reach 5th room with 14th person inside (make sure to loot treasure
first for LIGHTNING GLEAM ACC).

Get him back to the entrance - with ENERGY CORE 8 you receive now you have
access to W side of teleporter in 4th room. In there you will find 15th and
last person to be rescued, which you will of course take outside - plunder the
chest for WALL RING ACC. Now that all people are safe, you might want to
consider saving, for we're about to face a boss. Go to 4th room yet again, but
this time teleport to the N side to reach boss chamber.

1. Daigoro - VS one chr - phd
2. Kozuka - VS one chr - tears off 25% current MP, induces poison
3. Wakizashi - VS one chr OR all chrs - phd
4. Zanmato - VS all chrs - std, reduces HP and MP of all girls to 1
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
With lonely exception of Zanmato, memorize this - boss can attack and thus
also kill only one girl at once. Daigoro is fairly weak PATK for 200 damage a
pop, Kozuka damages girl's current MP and Wakizashi inflicts about 300 damage.
But fear Zanmato - it reduces both HP and MP to 1 measly point. As soon as
Zanmato has happened, one girl heals immediately and keep other two at standby
in case boss happens to pull attack faster and KO a girl.

Prior to battle maximize girls' AGL and DEF. Screw MP, we won't need it that
much anyway. Also forget about statuses you were hoping to inflict on the
boss. With rare exceptions it's immune to almost everything. If you already
have samurai DSP from storyline mission 10, consider throwing some cash.

As battle starts, you're fairly safe for some rounds before things get hectic
- Kozuka will frequently poison your girls, so be on standby to counter this
with Antidotes, while Daigoro makes sure to whittle girls' HP down. Or if you
have dark knights who have already mastered Poisonproof PASA, so much better!
One thing less to worry about. Kozuka is quite useless (we won't be relying on
magic at all), while Wakizashi is only a bit stronger than Daigoro IMO.

Pay attention to Dark Y.'s charging stances - if you see it lift its right
hand in front of its face, Zanmato is coming up next! Immediately prep Mega-
Potion and use it. There's a 33% chance Dark Y. might still act a bit faster
than the healer and will KO someone with a damaging attack, in which case it
is wise to react quickly and use Phoenix Down.

The way of the sheeze shows: use two white mages and one warrior or dark
knight. Now what you do is have your white mages continously use Pray, while
third girl slowly but surely brings down Dark Y.'s HP. When Zanmatoed, two
quick Prays will ensure that you don't get wiped out by Daigoro or Wakizashi.
*****************************************************************************

MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! If you saved all 15 people, you will receive TETRA
MASTER GG. Contributors NGEVA and Skhool101 comment: I managed to save 12
people and I still got this GG. So all is not lost after all - just make sure
you nab 12 people and your GG collection will rise. Also, it's highly
beneficial you visit N most room in 'CL - cavern' yet again - this time you
can plunder a chest there that contains STAR BRACER ACC.

Note that Publicity m., Bridal m., chocobo breeding (if you bothered to
accomplish the requirements for it in CH2) and lots of other minigames found
here are still available for your pleasure, so have fun! MAKE SURE you visit
the agency in the middle of Calm lands again - Shinra will install one of his
CommSpheres there. If chocobo ranch is open, go there - tag to upper floor by
taking the ramp in the middle; doing so will make Shinra install yet another
CommSphere.

BATTLE BLOCKADE
Garik, in his hatred of the Guado, has decided to launch an attack! Meet him
on the summit of Mt. Gagazet and stop him - by force, if that's what it takes.
Objective: Stop Garik's attack
------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------

You can't use any teleport pads, as Garik fixed-them-up. You'll have to climb
Gagazet the hard way. Make it all the way to 'G - fayth scar 1'. This time no
climbing for you (it doesn't pay back anyway, as chests haven't been refilled,
but you may want to revisit Floating Ruins from CH1, just in case you've
forgotten some chests to be stormed), but instead choose path to the left and
you'll find yourself inside Gagazet caverns.

BTW, stepping on teleport pads as you climb will release the seal on them.
Continue your climb until you reach 'G - summit region', but SAVE YOUR GAME
before you exit...

Depending on your answers to Ronso questions presented on CH1 and CH2,
following boss battle can unwind in two ways. If you didn't answer any
questions at all, or have missed too many of them, then please read boss entry
just below to learn of the strategy for the battle. If Ronso's questions were
answered correctly for the most part, then skip this boss entry and read for

----------------------------------- ATTACKS ---------------------------------
1. 'Stab' - VS one chr - phd
2. MP Blowout - VS one chr - robs the girl of all MP
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
A challenge worthy of your time! You may very well have a lot of problems on
your hands, esp considering Garik's Mighty Guard, which grants a lot of useful
POSSE on all enemies which are still present in battle. Not only that, is also
increased DEF, MDEF and EVA of all enemies - if not disposed of quickly,
you'll have troubles hitting them and dealing massive amounts of damage will
also be a big problem.

The easy way to win this battle is having one girl turn into black mage and
equip her with Gris-Gris Bag you've won from Dark B. This will make her immune
to curse status. Now all that Garik will do in battle is attack black mage
only with Bane Lance. This means no Mighty Guard - woot?

Some preparations are to be done before commencing the battle - improve
girls' DEF and AGL. A good way of setting yourself up would be to have white
mage and songstress - former will be setting up Protect only, while latter
will be busy chanting Darkness Dance. And let's not forget dark knight. Why is
white mage needed for Protect only? You'll be attacked by 'MP Blowout' a lot
and it takes away all MP, making the need for MP quite useless. So when battle
starts, white mage casts Protect and then changes into second dark knight.

If you've been fluently practicing alchemist's job, you may consider mixing
some nice combinations which deal fixed damage regardless of target's stats -
only thing that can get in the way is protect and shell. If alchemist isn't an
option, you still have attack items from your inventory to toss around.

'Stab' attack usually takes away around 200 HP, so this may encourage you a
bit more into winning this battle. It often starts by Garik casting Mighty
Guard right off the bat. If you're willing to spend time healing MP needed for
white mage to keep casting Dispel (which removes all POSSE induced by Mighty
Guard except stat increases), you better have a lot of Ethers in your sack.
Both sidekicks will be busy attacking you for most of the time - until one
decides that it might be a good idea to reduce one girl's MP to zero.

Get rid of at least one sidekick ASAP to reduce the damage you're taking.
Believe me, getting pummeled by three guys which have big status boosts ain't
a pretty sight to look at. If you have any ability that confuses enemies (most
of alchemist's status mixes have such effect, ie Potion + Sleep Grenade), by
all means use it (poison inflicted will make sure they don't gain any HP
back). And this battle is also another nice opportunity to test out some of
SDSP.

So, clear POSSE if you can afford to, cast Protect at start of battle, have
songstress on Darkness Dance parade, while dark knights kill off sidekicks (or
read on various other suggestions I've complied above) and then finish off
Garik for good.
*****************************************************************************

Now let's talk strategy in case you answered most of the questions correctly.

*****************************************************************************
BOSS BATTLE - GARIK & 1x RONSO YOUTH
GARIK'S STATS are the same as in above boss entry, but ATTACKS differ
----------------------------------- ATTACKS ---------------------------------
1. 'Stab' - VS one chr - phd
2. Shell - on all enemy party or himself - bestows shell
3. Protect - on all enemy party or himself - bestows protect
4. Bane Lance - VS one chr - phd, induces curse
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

RONSO YOUTH'S STATS are the same as in above boss entry, but ATTACKS differ
----------------------------------- ATTACKS ---------------------------------
1. 'Stab' - VS one chr - phd
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
This battle is so much easier. To prevent Garik from casting Shell and
Protect, simply empty his MP and no more protective stuff for him. You may
consider confusing him as well - and he may cast Mighty Guard on you.

Unlike above boss battle variation, you will encounter one Ronso Youth in this
one. All he will do is a simple PATK, and he doesn't possess MP Blowout
attack, making him even easier. Simply use whatever you desire to take down
these two bozos.
*****************************************************************************

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
Dark V. is not to be taken lightly like first of its kind we've defeated at
the end of CH2. However, if you know what's in the woods for you, this boss is
manageable. For starters, it doesn't have any attack pattern it strictly
follows, meaning you'll have to be on your toes for whole battle.

Boss' 'smash' hits one for about 300 damage, Energy Ray hits all for 300,
while Energy Blast deals 400 damage to all girls. Did you remember to buy lots
of Hi-Potions on Celsius when I advised you to? Also prior to battle fix up
girls' DEF and AGL, for boss is quite fast. Hi-Potions you've brought along
will help manage to keep a steady flow of HP, unless you're considering
bringing into battle white mage who will tip odds in your favor by Protect and
Shell.

Still problems with all that? Jobs of choice are two dark knights (I don't
recommend samurais (ie, if you've cleared storyline mission 10 already)) and
white mage. Have white mage Protect, then Shell everybody - afterwards you
have two options. Either you keep up Cura/ga-on-all-girls tech or you use Hi-
Potions or Mega-Potions to heal your wounds (in latter case employ alchemist
who has learned Mega-Potion ACTA), while dark knights slowly chip away at Dark
V.'s HP until it's defeated. Shell will help keep damage from Energy Ray and
Energy Blast at a safe distance, only problem left being 'smash' which is used
so often.

Fortunately you can inflict all Breaks on boss, so you may also want to
consider warrior's ACTA. Or how about berserker with Counterattack PASA? Every
time you're attacked Dark V. will feel the pain right back. There are quite a
few options for defeating this sucker, you just need to seek them out.

Back onboard choose Kilika as next destination. Chests have been refilled, so
steal the contents again, but do NOT visit Dona's yet. MAKE SURE you talk to
camera man on the boat in lower right corner of 'K - res. area' - choose
[Okay, thanks.]. Doing this is important for getting acc later in CH5.

To pass the guards of N Kilika gate you'll need Dona's assistance - but before
that save your game, for you want next acc, trust you me. Enter her house,
after the scene climb the stairs to collect some gil from the chest. Now go
back out - when choice is prompted, select [You bet I am!] to activate
minigame.

Sneak through the gate unnoticed while Dona distracts one of the guards. Wait
for a guard to open the gate, then make a break for it! Press X to rush the
gate, or R1 to switch point of view. Watch closely, and when time is right,
press X to rush the gate. The guard Dona is talking to will occassionally turn
around to check the gate - don't rush when he's looking. If you get thru
unnoticed, you'll score BUSHIDO LORE ACC in the chest that will appear. Should
you be noticed, chest won't appear - in latter case simply reload your game.

You're thru! We're in Kilika forest again at 1stcross. All routes to Kilika
temple have now been thoroughly blocked. There's three blockades in total, so
search out all three to see a scene. Remember a giant log that crosses over
the path? Return there and a scene will trigger - on next screen simply go N.
Now climb the stairs to the top - mission is triggered at last.

Enter the temple, use SSP to save and enter the cloister. Step on lift and
press X to activate, then proceed N to another entrance. Kill Daeva in
following battle - it should be easy, as Daeva tends to cast Haste on itself
first. Approach blue-flamed door and kill another Daeva. In next room examine
blue flame on E wall, then W wall and finally N wall. Each time you'll also
need to kill one Daeva. Enter next room and kill two Daevas to disable the
flames. As you go down the stairs, pay attention to the floor - pick up
SAMURAI DSP found there. Stick with dark knights for now, BTW. Go up the
stairs and another old friend says hi...

4. Firaga - FATT VS all chrs - fire mgd
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
Dark I. will start to cause problems - Meteor Strike hits one for 500 damage,
'Smash' is worth 200 to one, Firaga 300 to all and Hell Fire 500 to all girls.
Unfortunately it appears that Dark I. doesn't have a set attack pattern, sadly
making him unpredictable. But with a big chunk of Hi-Potions you've brought
along it ain't a problem to keep your HP up, yes?

Prior to battling this guy check you acc and see if you have any fire
resistant acc stuffed in there... if you do, make sure to equip those acc -
you've just rendered 50% of Dark I.'s attacks weaker or completely obsolete.
Only thing left to worry about is 'swipe' (Protect white magic) and Meteor
Strike (Shell white magic).

Okay, bring in white mage and two dark knights. Have white mage Shell
everybody, and you may also want to employ using Protect just in case, then
keep up Cura/ga-on-all-girls tech, while dark knights slowly chip away at Dark
I.'s HP until it's defeated. You just can't lose.

4. Thor's Hammer - NATT VS all chrs - mgd
5. Thundara - LATT VS all chrs - light mgd
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
Dark Ix. will be a problem child to defeat - Thundara strikes all for 150,
'Smash' strikes one for 200, Thor's Hammer all girls for 700 damage. Prior to
battle check your inventory to see if you have any acc that reduce lightning
damage in any way. Anything lightning related that you have equipped means one
worry less of your back. Don't forget to have pockets bursting from a supply
of Hi-Potion (alchemist will do perfect here). Here's boss attack pattern!
Once it uses Aerospark for the fourth time, it'll use Recharge on next turn,
followed by Thor's Hammer. Then pattern repeats.

Boss relies heavily on lightning attacks. Jobs of choice are yet again white
mage and two dark knights. Have white mage Shell everybody, and you may also
want to employ using Protect just in case, then change her into third dark
knight and help hacking other two. Percentage wise, there's 40% chance that
Dark Ix. will use an attack that cannot kill you - Recharge on itself or
Aerospark (gravity attack based on current HP, but damage done cannot be
reduced in any way). As soon as you see boss cast Recharge on itself, heal
yourself up - next attack coming is Thor's Hammer. If there's a chance, apply
shell status as well, otherwise make sure your HP is around 1000 or so. Be
advised - Thor's Hammer is NON-ELEMENTAL ATTACK. It is not lightning based.

Should you choose to cripple the boss when it comes to offensive and defensive
powers, feel free to bust it up will all breaks. Like Dark I., Dark Ix. as
well isn't immune to them. It can also be slowed down, which is a recommended
status to be used, as boss is quite fast in launching its attacks.
*****************************************************************************

Big amount of scenes. UNWAVERING GUARD GG, CRIMSON SPHERE 2 KEY ITEM and
CRIMSON SPHERE 3 KEY ITEM are yours (make sure you watch them as soon as
you're aboard Celsius!). When in control, run around a bit until few more
scenes kick in. When Yuna says [I'm all alone.], MAKE SURE YOU PRESS X BUTTON!
KEEP PRESSING THAT X BUTTON LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW! If you heard FOUR

Aboard on Celsius again, eh? Let's do optional stuff first. Here's the things
Barkeep sells...
-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
BARKEEP'S SHOP
Potion 50               | Twist Headband (Sleepproof) 3000

While you're here, also make sure that you choose [Rest.] when you talk to
Barkeep. And as usual, engine room chests have been restocked, so be sure to
steal from them: 6x REMEDY, 8x HI-POTION, 7x PHOENIX DOWN and 3x TURBO ETHER.

Head for the lift and choose 'C - deck'. Up here find Paine and talk to her,
then back to bridge. AL BHED PRIMER KEY ITEM is yours. Now talk to Shinra and
choose a new option added to his menu, called [CommSphere Network]. You'll see
a map of Spira with four functional CommSpheres - Besaid, Kilika, Mushroom
rock and Bevelle. Connect to these four at least once to trigger the event
back in Celsius.

Controls for camera: directionals move the camera in desired direction, R1
zooms in picture three times, then resets, while Square skips the sequence
entirely. Connect to Besaid, turn camera right until you spot Wakka's house
and wait a bit. Wakka will walk out and start blahblah... Then connect to
Kilika - turn camera right and Dona will share her bit. Mushroom rock is next
- talking straight away... Finally connect to Bevelle. Here you must wait few
seconds for someone to appear and start talking - if he doesn't, turn camera
around a bit, then reset the position and he will appear.

BTW, if you've sided with New Yevon, CommSphere at Mushroom will be tossed in
the ocean after viewing the scene there. If you've sided with Youth League,
CommSphere at Bevelle will be shot at after viewing the scene there.

Once you view all four sequences, talk to MN to your left. When in control of
Yuna, TALK TO PAINE SO SHE MENTIONS HYMN OF THE FAYTH! Now talk to Shinra yet
again and choose first option to get a view on all CommSpheres you've been
placing over Spira. If you don't wish to be bothered by that and would like to
skip to next part of walkthru, press CTRL + F and type in this phrase, without
the asterisks: *SKIP004*

                         POST-SM11 BONUS STUFF - EX007
#############################################################################

There's one single bonus thing that can be taken care of before tackling
storyline mission 12.

After viewing four initial CommSphere sequences, talk to MN to your left. When
in control of Yuna, Shinra will inform you that all of 20 CommSpheres are now
operational. Talk to him yet again and choose first option to get a view on
all CommSpheres you've been placing over Spira. Concentrate on one at a time -
keep connecting to them, then rotate the camera, look for interesting features
and so on until either the CommSphere breaks or there's nothing else
interesting left to be spotted when viewing the CommSpheres. Be advised -
sometimes it takes quite a long time before the scene starts, so don't
disconnect! If you've been following my guide fluently, then you'll be able to
see all of the scenes listed below.

Of special importance is viewing the beacon on Mi'ihen road. First time you
check it out, Rin will walk out of agency and address Yuna in helping him out
to clear confusion as to why did machines go on a rampage not long ago. Pick
[Certainly.] when asked. Trust me, you want this. Controls are as follows:
directionals move the camera in desired direction, R1 zooms in picture three
times and then resets, R2 brings up camera switch menu, Circle calls up Rin,
Square skips the sequence entirely. Here are camera's locations...

CAMERA 1 - Travel Agency, front
CAMERA 2 - Travel Agency, back
CAMERA 3 - Ruins
CAMERA 4 - Newroad
CAMERA 5 - Hover crash site
CAMERA 6 - Oldroad interior
CAMERA 7 - Shinra's Commsphere (must have seen Shinra drop it off the cliff
           after 'Machina Mayhem!' mission)
CAMERA 8 - Highroad north entrance

For this guide you'll want to get Ragnarok acc as well as your favorite
blondie. If this is the case, examine cameras in this order:
- CAM3: wait for a machine to come running and press Circle
- CAM4: a group of people is stationed here, press Circle
- INVESTIGATION LEVEL UP!
- CAM5: wait for three machines to get near the hover, press Circle
- CAM7: simply press Circle
- INVESTIGATION LEVEL UP!
- CAM1: turn camera left until you see Rin, press Circle
- CAM2: turn camera up and wait for somebody to start hammering the roof,
        then press Circle
- INVESTIGATION FINISHED! You will receive Ragnarok later in CH5.

Talk to MN when he's sitting in top left seat and choose [You bet!]. HS in
Moonflow road has appeared. I hate this mission, heh! You begin in 'M - S bank
road', so no way to go but N. A scene will be triggered and you'll spot your
objective. Keep advancing N until you reach 'M - S wharf' for a scene. Back to
'M - S bank road' - retrace your steps until you see that midget try to escape
on a vehicle. Great, now you must return to 'M - S wharf' again.

Cross the Moonflow by shoopuf, then make it all the way to 'M - N bank road'.
Go to the entrance of Guadosalam and MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! You get BLACK
TABARD GG!

With this Storyline Mission 12 has come to an end.

So viewing the beacons again, are we? Concentrate on one at a time - keep
connecting to them, then rotate the camera, look for interesting features and
so on until either the beacon breaks or there's nothing else interesting left

When you're finished with viewing the spheres, head for Celsius' inn. Here
Rikku is trying to dance and you're invited to try your wits at keeping up

buttons wildly - which is what you should do. You'll get that high score in no
time. Here's the rewards you can reap:

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
'Swipe', 'swipe', Flame Breath, 'swipe', 'swipe', Tail Smash... What's this,
you ask? Boss' attack pattern, hehe. Quite easy to figure out, it was. To
further exploit Zalamander's weaknesses, it's vulnerable to darkness and has a
soft spot for ice damage. It can also be berserked (thus nullifying both sweep
attacks) or ejected from battle (I'm sure you already have some ways at your
disposal to do so). It's wise not to use any type of magic attacks on
Zalamander, as it's immune to magic damage - however, items that deal mgd can
affect it.

Flame Breath hits all for 400 damage (fire resistant acc are welcome to be
used), while its 'swipe' hits for 500 damage and Tail Smash clears off certain
percentage of MAX HP. Okay, bring in white mage and two dark knights. Have
white mage Protect everybody, then keep up Cura/ga-on-all-girls tech, while
dark knights chip away at Zalamander's health until it's defeated. You just
can't lose.

If you've come to this boss underleveled or without attempting any subquests
as all, you might have some problems with it. There's an easy solution, tho' -
have a thief use Steal Will on Zalamander. It may miss occassionally, but this
is the easiest way to get rid of it.

Battling Zalamander in its OSF is not much different that regular form. It
will start the battle by charging two turns for Crushing Tail. Use the time
you're given to attack it mercilessly - leave no space for being slow.
Crushing Tail will shave off 50% of MAX HP when it hits, but damage can be
reduced by protect. Tip more odds in your favor by inflicting darkness on the
bastard. If during charge moves Zalamander receives enough attacks, it will
cancel its Crushing Tail attempt and prompt it to use Bruiser Tail. Zalamander
still takes no magic damage in OSF.

Unlike RGF, Zalamander's actions in OSF cannot be predicted, which means that
its 'swipe' and Flame Breath are a game of chance. Once again, though,
darkness on Zalamander and Fire Eater PASA of your girls make these two
attacks a breeze.
*****************************************************************************

When Zalamander is gone, loot the chest it was guarding for BLACK RING ACC.
Now return to cave's entrance (if you wish, scavenge the rest of the chests
inside here for X-POTION, ELIXIR, 2x PHOENIX DOWN and HASTE BANGLE ACC) and
witness another scene. This time the % events are timed a bit, so you'll have
to hurry! On the bridge whole Gullwings crew is gathered...

TALK TO RIKKU FIRST, IMMEDIATELY, STRAIGHT AWAY - second time you talk to her
she'll respond with regular text box - wait too long and she'll reposition
herself near Shinra's seat, at which point you're screwed (if this happens,
reload an earlier save).

THEN talk to Bro, Buddy and Paine, until they all respond with regular text
boxes. Finally address Shinra and then Rikku to trigger another scene. After
that scene talk to midget you were chasing before and choose [On with the
show!]. This is followed by song CGI. Feast your eyes on yet another girl.
When in control, head to bridge. Old geezer I hate is back as well. After he
finishes rambling, DO NOT TALK to Shinra yet.

Instead board the elevator and head into 'C - engine room'. You'll find LB.
here, so talk to her to receive CRIMSON SPHERE 5 KEY ITEM (make sure you watch
it as soon as you have the chance!). Return to bridge and talk to Shinra one
last time to complete this mission for good.

With this Storyline Mission 13 has come to an end.

- C - bridge: mascot DSP*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENEMIES: None.

* - you get this DSP after getting 'Episode Complete' in every of the fifteen
areas of Spira; HOWEVER, MAKE SURE THAT ZANARKAND ISN'T LAST AREAS THAT YOU
CLEAR! IN FACT, MAKE IT THE FIRST AREA TO GET EPISODE COMPLETE!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You'll appear in front of the lift. Just few more playhours and game will be
completed. Now go for bridge again and see a scene. DO NOT TALK TO ANYONE JUST
YET! Go for 'C - engine room' first - you can again loot the chests in engine
room for 7x REMEDY, 4x TURBO ETHER, 8x PHOENIX DOWN and 4x X-POTION. Now go to
'C - cabin' and choose [Rest.] one final time. When Yuna wakes up, you'll hear
a chat between Barkeep and Bro. Remember, you had to rest in each CH at least
once.

As a bonus, Barkeep now offers [Pet Shop] option as well, which allows you to
rename animals girls use as trainers (NOT available if you don't have trainer
DSP). Oh, let's not forget his goods...

Once the scene is over, head on to 'C - engine room'. Go at the very end of
the room and when you try to go back, Buddy will appear and tell you a lil
story about the ship. There's two parts of the story you can hear:
- if your % completion is 60% or more, you will hear 1st part of the story
- if your % completion is 75% or more, you will hear 2nd part of the story
- if you have 75% or more and you're seeing Buddy storytelling for the first
  time, you will hear the whole deal

Now, once you feel you're ready to take on those HS, talk to MN and a HS will
appear in every single area. These are final sidequests of the game. Don't
want to be bothered with it, but instead wish to continue the story?

Storyline m.     - Triggers next storyline mission and advances the story. Be
                   advised that you cannot return to airship during some of
                   such missions.
Sidequest No.    - Denotes sidequest is available in target area.
                   [...] parenthesis denote that sidequest is 'hidden', ie
                   you can't see it on NavMap screen. You need to beam down
                   to target area and find the trigger which allows you to
                   start the mission.
Treasure         - Visit the area and free the contents of all chests.*
Scene            - Area worth visiting for few extra scenes.
PR Mission       - Most extensive sidequest IMO. Triggered in CH1 and lasts
                   whole game. Simply play minigames and lose credits.
Bride Mission    - Another extensive sidequest. Not worth your time IMO.

*   - Even though not indicated, all of the 15 areas you can visit contain
      treasure chests that can be looted.
[A] - Must have gotten O'aka on Celsius in CH1, cleared off his debt before
      CH2 ended and gained berserker DSP by completing sidequest mission 14.
[B] - Must be in possession of all 10 Crimson Spheres.

AGAIN, DO NOT LEAVE ZANARKAND AREA FOR LAST AREA TO BE COMPLETED! CLEAR IT OUT

Not telling! Enter Besaid village and head for the temple. In front of the
temple both Lu and Wakka are waiting - talk to Wakka! When scene is over,
examine the area S from the house marked as 'B - lodge' - you'll score BLACK
LORE ACC! Next head to Besaid beach.

On the way to the dock we will obtain these items: 'B - waterfall way 1' hides
TWILIGHT RAIN KEY ITEM, drop down behind the first bridge to get it;  'B -
cave' hides MEGA-POTION and 4x ETHER. Two items on 'B - beach' will have to
wait until we talk to Beclem. So talk to him - you receive WAR BUDDY SPHERE
KEY ITEM. Now you can reach secluded beach and rob two chests for 3500 GIL and
2x X-POTION. Go back to the village and you'll run into Wakka on the way -
talk to him for a scene, then enter the village. EPISODE COMPLETE!

Other points of interest are two Gunner's Gauntlet minigames you can have fun

** - these enemies fight you if you joined New Yevon
*** - you can get this acc only if you talked to cameraman in CH1 AND CH3
**** - you must get Episode Complete for Kilika
***** - if you missed it in CH3, now's your second chance to get it
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's leave the chests for later... enter 'K - res. area' screen for a long
series of scenes. When in control again, turn right, then go up and up again
to enter the stairs leading to Kilika temple. EPISODE COMPLETE! You're awarded
TRICKS OF THE TRADE GG. Now beam to Kilika again.

On 'K - dock' raid the chests for ETHER, 2x MANA TABLET, 3x PHOENIX DOWN,
REMEDY and another REMEDY. On 'K - res. area' do the same for 3000 GIL, 3x
LUNAR CURTAIN, 3x STAR CURTAIN, DISPEL TONIC and 3x LIGHT CURTAIN. The woman
on 'K - dock' is selling...

Wondering what's the deal with cameraman from CH1 and CH3? Beam down to Kilika
again and have final chat with him - pick [Okay, thanks!], followed by
[Definitely!] and a boatman will carry Yuna across to distant island. When on
shore again, throw a look at the minimap - yellow square indicates location of
INVINCIBLE ACC, whilst checking yellow X moving around awards you with 5x
GEORAPELLA COIN. Back to white X and back to Kilika.

Now enter Kilika woods - remember back in CH1 when you jumped on one of the
trees in E part of the woods to get Megalixir in the well-hidden chest? Do the
same now and score ARCANE LORE ACC. If you've already proceeded far enough
with Cactuar hunting, you will find 7th Cactuar here. Jump back down and onto
'K - temple'. Nab X-POTION, MEGA-POTION and ETHER. There's MEGALIXIR waiting
for you in 'K - monks' chambers', and in 'K - nuns' chambers' there's WALL
RING ACC and REGEN BANGLE ACC.

Enter the cloister: open the chests for CAT'S BELL ACC, WIZARD BRACELET ACC,
2x ETHER and 2x TURBO ETHER (this chest otherwise contains samurai DSP if you
missed getting it in CH3). That's it for this area!

As soon as you enter Luca, scene occurs - blitzball season is open.
Fortunately you don't have to play the minigame at all. When option is
presented, choose [Let's do it!] to play, or [I don't think so!] to forfeit
the game. Let's clear out some stuff regarding blitzball - there are no GG to
be won from there, and in my opinion there's only one acc worthy enough to
spark your interest: AP EGG ACC.

I will not be making blitzball section this time around. In my opinion
blitzball is made worse in this FF. There's no way for you to actively control
the actions of your players - instead you're made a coach and you must make
your players train in order to improve stats etc.

Anyway, there's already a Blitzball FAQ available at below URL, so be sure to
check it out.

http://db.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/file/final_fantasy_x_2_blitzball.txt

Entering 'Basement A' behind blitzball registration desk will allow you to pit
yourself in Sphere Break minigame, should you desire. Also, if you didn't get
lady luck DSP in CH3, now's your second chance! But beware, to beat Shinra,
you must meet 100 quota in 20 turns with 30 secs per turn.

Missing some songs and movies from your collection? Visit Luca theater to
expand your collection then.

Fourth point of interest and reason why we came here is... head to the stairs
that lead to Mi'ihen road. From SSP found at base of those stairs go S and
approach the fence...

------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------
FOLLOW THAT MOOGLE!
There's furtive, floating, fluffy, flying moogle. What more do you need to
know? Chase after it!
Objective: Catch the moogle?
------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------

As the mission starts, have Yuna go right and down the stairs into 'Square'.
Here you'll see a moogle floating about - catch up to it and press X to
examine it and to trigger a scene. Go to 'bridge' afterwards and check up on
moogle yet again (this time it'll wait for you). Then moogle escapes W, so
just follow it to 'Dock 2'. You're now at Luca docks, but where's the moogle?
It's waiting in front of the ship situated in this dock. Approach the moogle
for another scene... This is now what we call MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! And
EPISODE COMPLETE!

* - item awarded depends on who the culprit is
** - must be able to ride chocobos, impossible to get these items if the
culprit turned out to be Prophet
*** - if Rin is unable to figure out the culprit, you receive this item
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you've been helping Rin out in his investigation of machine going crazy in
CH4, there will be a HS pointing on Mi'ihen road. As soon as you beam down,
you'll be approached by Al Bhed female and offered a choice - pick [Not at
all.] to collect your reward. Exit the agency and after a lengthy scene...

- if you pinned Rikku, you get RAGNAROK ACC, can ride chocobos and you will
receive EPISODE COMPLETE!
- if you pinned Chocobo Eater, you can ride chocobos and you will receive
EPISODE COMPLETE!
- if you pinned Calli, you can ride chocobos and you will receive EPISODE
COMPLETE!
- if you pinned Rin, you get GIPPAL'S SPHERE KEY ITEM, can ride chocobos for
free, but you get Episode Concluded! only
- if you pinned Prophet, you get nothing, except for Episode Concluded!
- also, if you were going for Prophet, one of the possible scenes you see
during CH4 investigation is the event where Rin finds a chest hidden by
Prophet - don't sweat it if you miss this, for the contents of that chest was
measly 2x X-Potion

In short, if you're going for mascot, you must get either choco-chef, Rikku or
Calli to be prime suspects. Get any of other two and mascot is lost for this
game. Also, contributor Allister informed me of getting 0,2% completion if you
watch Gippal's Sphere once you're on the airship.

To ride chocobos, simply speak to hover attendants.

Wanna storm the chests? Go ahead, as every item listed in item checklist
EXCEPT two can be found in chests. To get 5x Phoenix Down and Victor Primoris
you have to do the following (also, you MUST be able to ride chocobos on
Mi'ihen!!!): go to 'Highroad - newroad, N' and look carefully for a chocobo
feather. Stand on it a few seconds (be patient!) and then select [Am I ever!],
when choices pop up - 5x PHOENIX DOWN is yours. Leave this screen and then
return to the EXACT SAME SPOT. Again wait - this time it takes some time
before choices appear. Select [Am I ever!] again and VICTOR PRIMORIS KEY ITEM
belongs to you.

Below you see the merchandise of the agency on Mi'ihen...

There's an optional dungeon which can be tackled - to uncover it, you must
send Lv5 chocobo to Mi'ihen area. Once this chocobo returns, there's a chance
for it to uncover fiend colony bonus dungeon. It is located near the place
where you fought Chocobo Eater way back in CH2 - it will appear onscreen as a
green fog - simply enter it and select [Yup, yup!].

An onscreen instruction will tell you how to navigate your way thru fiend
colony (be aware, there's no minimap to help you with) and how to blast thru
walls. Contributor GDD has sent me a link to an excellent map of this area,
which can be found here (original credit goes to FFSKY-Team):

He has also sent me a modified version of the image, but until some issues are
cleared, you'll have to make due with the above link or below ASCII map.

URL map related notes:

- DOUBLE LINED WALL - weak wall with 5 endurance points (5x S-Bomb); there's
                      23 weak walls in total
- ORANGE WALL - strong wall with 10 endurance points (5x M-Bomb); there's 6
                strong walls in total
- RED WALL - super strong wall with 25 endurance points (9x L-Bomb); there's
             3 super strong walls in total

URL map & ASCII map related notes:

* - 1 SQUARE - possible random location for NATURE'S TOME ACC; stand in any
               of the locations marked as '1' on the map and choose to use 1
               unit of any bomb item; press X to throw it and you'll uncover
               some gil, or will be forced to get rid of some enemies; in
               luckiest case a chest will fall down containing this acc or
               some other item - I suggest finding a '1' spot where chests
               fall down - sooner or later you'll score this acc
* - 2 SQUARE - way of getting BUSHIDO TOME ACC is the same as for Nature's
               Tome
** - use any amount and type of bombs near places marked as blue squares (in
     the URL map) or as number 3 (ASCII map) and you'll be forced to fight
     Epitaph, quite dangerous foe (Stoneproof is essential)
*** - 5xSB means that you will run into a wall that can be blown away by
      using 5x S-Bomb on it; similarly 5x MB stands for 5x M-Bomb and 5xLB
      for 5x L-Bomb

Random notes:

NOTE 1: Nature's Tome and Bushido Tome could be somewhere around the area of
        K, L and M squares.
NOTE 2: Bombing walls at any spot in the dungeon (or using bombs just about
        anywhere) may yield some interesting results: you'll receive an item
        or few gil, or you'll make the locals mad. In latter case girls
        engage in battle against few Creepers, Hug Bugs or Hexapods (escape
        isn't an option).
NOTE 3: If you have too much blasting fun, entrance to the dungeon will cave
        in. No big deal, don't worry. When you return to the entrance, simply
        throw about 15x L-Bomb to blast away the rocks, thus setting your
        girls free.

This time make sure you engage in random battles, cos enemies drop bombs you
need to blast thru walls. If there's lady luck with mastered Bribe with you,
use her to obtain large amounts of bombs. As you navigate this dungeon, stand
close to walls and pay attention to Yuna's skirt. If it starts to sway (as if
the wind would be blowing), that means you've found wall that can be blown
down.

Except for six Tome-type acc you can score, there's nothing so hot in this
dungeon - still, if you want to get The End GG, you must fight the boss of
this dungeon. Make your way to N-most end to encounter the master behind the
scenes...

7. [Demi] - GRATT VS all chrs - gravity mgd
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
This is the big head honcho of the fiend colony? Battle starts with an ambush,
but you really shouldn't worry too much. You need two pieces of equipment -
something that guards against sleep and something which absorbs fire damage.
With this stuff equipped you've already won the battle before it even begun.
Only matter standing in your way is large amount of HP boss has.

OSF battle is where a true challenge lies. First thing to note is that King's
elemental properties have shifted a bit - it now absorbs holy. Although that
shouldn't be any significant indication at all, King now has more attacks at
his disposal - Holy, Flare (which can be used against whole team!) and Demi.
Then there's Triple Attack and fire MATK left. When battle begins, girls will
be shelled by Firas and Firagas. But, lower King's HP becomes, more often Holy
and Flare will be used.

After weighing reasons pro and con for reflect it's evident that you'd want
reflect in place. So what if King absorbs holy and fire? Important thing is
that you won't be hit by Flare and Holy - former is stronger than the latter
and possible damage is greater. Triple Attack isn't used often and it's also
not quite strong either. To take care of Demi, equip a Black Ring acc to get
Gravity Eater.

* - While you're navigating 'M - ravine path', look for some rocks which serve
as a drop off base to reach 'M - ravine'.
** - Den of Woe is currently off limits. But as soon as you collect all 10
Crimson Spheres, you can enter the mysterious door.

- M - HQ lift: Machina Booster
- Youth HQ: Nooj's Sphere**, Crystal Bangle**
- Den of Woe: Magical Dances Vol. I

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* - you fight them only if you sided with Youth League
** - only if you've sided with Youth League
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

As you enter the area, follow the red arrow in minimap (on this screen take
the lift at N end to reach two chests with MEGA-POTION and 2500 GIL). Elma and
Lucil will come running to greet you. There are two possible outcomes
considering your choice at the start of CH2 - if you sided with New Yevon, you
only need to make it to the third elevator on 'M - HQ lift' to gain EPISODE
COMPLETE!

However, if you gave that sphere to Youth League, sidequest mission will be
initiated. Go the entrance of 'M - ravine path' to see a scene. Afterwards
speak to Yaibal and choose [You bet!] to start the mission!

------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------
YOUTH LEAGUE TOURNAMENT!
Defeat the Youth League's finest in a no-holds-barred fight to the finish! Do
you have what it takes? Commander Lucil will be the judge of that.
Objective: Win 7 battles in a row
------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------

As soon as above message disappears, you have to fight off first wave. When
you're victorious, follow Lucil N, fighting off waves of challengers. After
you smoke fourth set, heal yourself! Next three battles are consecutive.

5. Gold Hourglass - VS all chrs - induces slow
6. Lunar Curtain - on herself - induces shell
7. Hi-Potion - on herself - recovers 1000 HP
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
Hohoho, there's a possibility that you might get owned by her. In this battle
it's useless to rely on shell and reflect, as Miss L. relies heavily on items,
especially Lv3 element gems. Have at least one girl wear Ribbon, if you have
any. Beware, Lv3 element gems cannot be reflected. If you can equip stuff that
absorbs elemental damage and converts it to HP, equip that as well - it will
prove mightily useful!

Her most dangerous move is Harbinger, which adds doom on girl struck. Girls
with Ribbon won't be affected, but those without will - such girl will receive
a counter of three. Simply go all out - she'll die either way, so why bother?
As soon as she's KO-ed, use Phoenix Down immediately.

For quick ownage of Miss L., consider using dark knight's Charon, provided she
has at least 4000 MAX HP - Miss L. is the last opponent you're facing, so you
can risk losing a member. Or two.
*****************************************************************************

MISSION COMPLETE, as well as EPISODE COMPLETE! Woot! But do return to Mushroom
once again. Jump in 'M - ravine path 1' and score 3x TURBO ETHER, ELIXIR and
ELIXIR. Access to Den of Woe is almost granted, but we need two more spheres.

Also, if you were able to attempt the mission 'Youth League Tournament!', go
to Youth League HQ. On 'M - HQ lift' screen look below the lift for a chest
with MACHINA BOOSTER KEY ITEM (you can get it regardless of who you sided
with). When you're in front of the HQ, jump on little path on the extreme
right and raid the chest for CRYSTAL BANGLE ACC. Access to 'HQ - war room' is
also granted. Enter it, and then find Lucil on a long balcony. After the scene
you're awarded with NOOJ'S SPHERE KEY ITEM (make sure you watch it aboard
Celsius as soon as you have the chance).

Finally, when you're in possession of all 10 Crimson Spheres, return to
Mushroom r. once again and go to 'M - ravine 2' - but before you enter save
your game! Make haste to where the strange door is and examine it. Although
not really a sidequest mission, I treat it like so.

Save (if not already) at the entrance to the dungeon, then stroll inside. At
1stcross take NE path, at 2ndcross go SE and you'll reach square shaped room.
Prepare yourselves well for the upcoming series of boss battles - first two
battles are fought by Yuna alone (make sure Yuna has white mage job on her
GG!), and remaining three feature an all-out girl slugfest (have thief job on
all girls' GG!). Also check that thief has Steal MP ACTA learned.

BOSS STRATEGY
Miss R. is not to be taken lightly - Grenade will smoke off 200, and Lv2
element gems 300 damage to Yuna. Miss R.'s PATK takes off around 400. The
problem you'll be facing is her speed, with which she can attack quite often.
If you have any means of inducing slow with Yuna's DSP currently at your
disposal, do it! Ultimately, you can also put Miss R. to sleep and nail her
with MATK while she's dozing off. Otherwise, make sure you're healed after
sustaining three or four hits. Miss R. goes down...

4. Silence - VS all chrs - induces silence
5. Regen - on himself - induces regen
6. Not-So-Mighty Guard - on himself - induces shell and protect
7. Drill Shot - FRATTP VS one chr - fractional phd, tears off 75% MAX HP
8. Absorb - VS one chr - HP&MP stolen are added to Mr B.'s HP&MP
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
Looks like he wants some more... and I thought I already taught him a lesson
back in Bevelle. This time Mr B. replaced some of his attacks - no more Absorb
and Demi, but instead has Regen and Mighty Guard! Even more annoying, bleh -
Regen is used frequently, and Mighty Guard is used once you've caused Mr B. to
lose more than 75% HP.

Mr B.'s staff attacks inflict around 300 damage per hit - they're also used
very frequently, so applying protect may not be a bad idea. Don't bother with
shell, as there's no use for it. Now that you can command all girls, change
them into thieves ASAP - doing so eliminates stop induced by one of Mr B.'s
attacks. Have your girls steal all MP Mr B. has available - it's only measly
720 MP anyway. You've just prevented Mr B. from casting Regen and Mighty
Guard.

Last thing to watch out for is Mr B.'s Drill Shot, which is used once his HP
has been changed 10 times. Damage it does is gravity based, equals 75% of hit
girl's MAX HP, and can be reduced with protect. You'll know he's about to
perform it cos of specific battle stance he'll use. Mr B. goes down the
crapper...

5. Potion Plus - on himself - recovers 600 HP
6. Hush Grenade - STATT VS all chrs - std + induces silence
7. Mortar - VS all chrs - phd
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
This guy has somewhat fixed attack pattern - Grinder, 'kick', Grinder, 'kick'
and Bullseye used afterwards. There's a chance of Mr G. including some status
crap inbetween those attacks, but for measly 50 damage don't be afraid. As
this battle starts, change girls into two dark knights and white mage (to
apply protect and all that, after which make her dark knight too) to improve
your overall stats (also needed for final bout, which will commence shortly).
Grinder inflicts 500 damage and 'kick' 300 damage, both target single girl.

As battle issues, have white mage cast Protect as previously stated, then keep
harassing Mr G. with dark knights' PATK. Heal accordingly to damage you're
receiving - when you see Mr G. use 'kick' for second time, don't bother to
heal until next attack; Bullseye deals damage based on current HP or in
layman's terms - you can't be killed. Once you bring Mr G.'s HP below 75%,
he'll start using Mortar - nothing that high DEF and protect couldn't take
care of. Anything else you wanna know? It seems Mr G. is down the crapper
already...

4. Lightfall - STATT VS all chrs - 5000 universal damage
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
Fixed attack pattern with this guy as well, I'm afraid. No wait, that's a good
thing! 'Shot', 'shot', 'floorshot', 'shot', Greedy Aura, repeat. 'Shot' will
make one girl suffer 500 damage, 'floorshot' one girl for 1500 damage, and
Greedy Aura makes all girls suffer fractional dmg, which reduces both HP and
MP by 18,75% (considering MAX HP!). Lightfall is Mr N.'s most fearsome attack,
which rips off 5000 damage from all girls, once you bring him down below 75%
HP.

White mage is a must here - start by making girls protected and shelled, then
keep the health up with curative magic - regened girls is a nice option as
well. Other two girls can be either dark knights or samurais, choice is yours,
just make sure you choose a heavy hitter. I bet you're also considering
warrior and her assortment of breaks, all of which can be planted upon Mr N.
to make him more manageable? Be my guest.

Once boss' HP drops below 75%, make sure you have over 5000 HP, or else you'll
be killed by Mr N.'s Lightfall, which he'll use on first turn he gets - this
is the only time you'll see it, so if you survive it, you've already won this
long battle. Mr N., down the crapper with you too!

1. 'Punch' - VS one chr - phd
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
As it's currently still on Lv1 in attack, defense and special, it shouldn't be
too tough to take down. Prior to battle maximize girls' DEF and HP, and once
the battle starts, apply protect. Then keep chipping off its health until it
goes down.
*****************************************************************************

After victory you receive AL BHED PRIMER KEY ITEM. You will learn that you can
fight Experiment again, but you need to find repair manuals. There's five of
them in total, so far I've been able to sniff out four of them:
1. 'D - trials': in the room with five pedestals you needed to push back in
   CH3 there's a man standing silently; input password MARNELA to get first
   manual, THE SPIRIT OF RECYCLING KEY ITEM
2. 'D - living q 1': simply talk to seated Al Bhed to obtain HOW TO REPAIR
   WITH SOUL KEY ITEM
3. 'D temple': in NE end of the screen you'll see three monkeys; stand
   between them and patiently wait until the three of them start jumping at
   the same time; as soon as they do, punch X to receive REPAIRING FOR
   DUMMIES KEY ITEM
4. Open up the passage to 'Calm lands - ruin depths', which is located in
   Chocobo ranch; one of the chests inside has THE ABC'S OF REPAIRS KEY ITEM
5. Mi'ihen area: examine all of the machinas running around in the entire
   area of Mi'ihen; one holds EVERYMAN'S REPAIR MANUAL KEY ITEM

Just finding the manuals won't do. You have to go digging in Bikanel to
salvage parts. Every part you find is automatically inserted into Experiment.
You need to bring its Attack, Defense and Special levels to 5. Use two charts
below to find out how.

CHART 1                               | CHART 2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ASSEMBLY TYPE Z is worth 5 PTS        | 0 - 3 PTS warrant Lv1
ASSEMBLY TYPE S is worth 3 PTS        | 4 - 9 PTS warrant Lv2
ASSEMBLY TYPE A is worth 1 PTS        | 10 - 19 PTS warrant Lv3
                                      | 20 - 37 PTS warrant Lv4
                                      | 38+ PTS warrant Lv5
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

So go get digging until you scrap together enough parts. Then visit 'D -
antechamber' and talk to the guy near the Experiment. Pick [Sure, here you
go.], then go up the stairs again to initiate the sequence. Choose [Take on
the Experiment]...

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
Hey there! Don't worry about that stupid Al Bhed who says you can't take on
Experiment once it's on Lv5. In fact, it's so easy I could cry. For starters,
here's its attack pattern: 'punch', Rocket Launcher, 'punch', Rocket Launcher,
Lifeslicer, Annihilator.

I won this battle by using three dark knights - they have highest HP and
formidable DEF and MDEF to stand against boss' attacks. Immediately whip out
Light Curtain, so that you render first four attacks 50% less effective. You
may want to consider using regen status as well. As soon as you see second
Rocket Launcher, Experiment will unleash Lifeslicer on next turn. This will
inevitably kill girl targeted, so just heal her up with Phoenix Down.

Annihilator can be learned by your gun mages, and this is the only chance in
entire game. If you miss it, you will have to wait until New game+. Here are
some more specifics on Annihilator - it's MATK, but it ignores MDEF. All girls
will get hammered for around 1500 damage. Once Annihilator is used, boss
resets its attack pattern.

- if you failed one/two/all Moonflow missions, Tobli goes down the crapper

A FALLEN GENIUS?
Frenzied fiends are feeding off the energy stored in the lightning rod towers.
Destroy every last one of the fiends clinging to the towers.
Objective: Defeat the fiends at each tower
------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------

Something appears to be meddling with lightning towers scattered over Thunder
p. Your objective is to investigate (and possibly kill) the cause of this
incident. Your first job is to kill 9 Rhyos enemies - 5 of them are in S
Thunder p., and other four in N part. Just seek out white triangles on minimap
and you'll find them all in no time. You can make a stop at Rin agency in
middle of the plains to save your progress, then continue on to S part. Shop's
goods...

As you keep killing Rhyoses, you'll see chests appear in their places. Item
inside depends on how many successful entries you managed to input on single
tower in CH2 or CH3. Again, I stress that awards aren't THAT great, and can be
obtained elsewhere in easier ways. Best item in my opinion is Ribbon you get
if you successfully calibrated 10th tower.

When you kill 9th Rhyos, scene occurs and red arrow will appear in minimap -
so follow it, but before you make it to point of impact, you may want to save
your progress. When you're ready, approach the spot and pick [Let's check it
out.]. You're going DOWN!

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
A formidable foe and one that doesn't fall easy. To prepare your girls for
this sucker, I suggest using two samurais (if you don't have samurai DSP yet,
go to Kilika temple and get it) and white mage. Beef up your DEF as high as
you can, for Humbaba has enormous STR. Dark knight is not recommended for this
battle as she requires quite some time before she can attack again.

As soon as battle starts, Humbaba will cast Mighty Guard - use samurai's
Fingersnap to clear off stat boosts, whilst white mage's Dispel takes care of
statuses Humbaba has gained. There, you're as good as old. Alternately, you
can hamper Humbaba pretty easily in MP field - have a thief at hand and make
her steal all of Humbaba's MP - say sayonara to Mighty Guard (which is used
once again when Humbaba loses 66% of its HP) and Thundaga (400 damage to all).
All that's left to worry about are Humbaba's PATK.

And they are not to be messed with - Uppercut (1500 damage) carries a huge
delay, so having fast girls is a must here (as said, dark knights would have
big trouble). Once Humbaba loses 66% of HP, it gains access to Tyrant Tail
attack - hits all girls for about 800 damage and has small delay effect.
'Swipe' inflicts moderate damage of about 400 to one girl. Apply that Protect
now!

You need to be aware of one more danger - once Humbaba is defeated, it will
cast Meteor as a last resort to kill your party girls. I tried killing Humbaba
with counterattack, but still Meteor is used. Only way to not see Meteor is
using eject techs on Humbaba (also the fastest way to win the battle) or
bribing it. So prior to ending the battle make sure your HP is at its peak,
for you must survive the oncoming onslaught! Victory is yours.

OSF battle - woohoo! Mighty Guard issues at start of battle, then it's time
for [Eyeing (girl)...] attacks, which are pointed at the girl with highest
current HP. Humbaba will then assault the girl with three 'swipes', three
Thundagas, or two Uppercuts. There's a small possibility that Humbaba will
follow up by Tyrant Tail. To make this fight ridiculously easy, equip stuff to
absorb lightning attacks and have the girl with highest HP be under protect to
ensure she'll be taking the least damage possible. Temporary bonuses gained
from Mighty Guard can easily be cleared off by a simple Dispel and samurai
using Fingersnap to destroy stat bonuses. Beware of Humbaba dying when
defeated - Meteor is still used. Shell and high HP will guarantee your
survival. Or CONGRATS! the thing - your choice.
*****************************************************************************

MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! VALIANT LUSTRE GG is yours!

Once you kill Humbaba, you'll be asked another option - pick [Yup, in the
hole.] to enter optional dungeon (near the Al Bhed that asks you this question
you'll see a chest - inside is a reward for calibrating 10th tower).
Technically this isn't a sidequest mission, but I'll include it anyway.
Completing this mission as well awards EPISODE COMPLETE! As for exploration of
Thunder p. dungeon you've just been thru, skip next boss entry and read below
for how to navigate this dungeon.

'TP - new cave' - 1ST RAID ATTEMPT!
Somewhere inside Cid is to be found (your objective). This dungeon is a huge
maze and getting lost can happen quite often. To find Cid, follow these
directions (as viewed by minimap!): E, W, S, E and N. Prepare yourself!

BOSS STRATEGY
Dark knight, dark knight and dark knight - get the idea? Prior to battle raise
their STR as high as you can - then as soon as battle issues, have all three
execute Darkness and wave bye-bye to Recorders. If you've been unfortunate
enough to use Darkness in any prior battles and this command is locked now,
then resort to using attack items from your inventory.

Now immediately change one girl into white mage and have her apply Protect -
most of the attacks you'll be seeing now is Panzer's Gatling Gun (50 damage
per hit, while 'bash' gives around 400 damage to one girl) - have white mage
at standby with Cura/ga. Meanwhile switch remaining girls into warriors and
execute Power Break on Panzer until STR down has SSTLV of 10, making damage it
does quite laughable. In addition it can also be slowed down. As Panzer now
has no backup left and has been severely hampered in several fields, it's no
longer a serious threat to your kickass girls.

Don't forget to add shell as well, as Panzer has the capability of launching
Sorcery Ray attack once its HP has been reduced below 75%. Expect to see
around 1000 damage inflicted to all girls.

Remember, if any of your abilities are locked, concentrate on killing that
Watcher - as soon as it's dismantled, abilities are no longer locked.

EPISODE COMPLETE! You also score AL BHED PRIMER KEY ITEM. Back on Celsius go
to 'C - deck' - look for Cid and he'll enter the elevator. Now go to 'C -
bridge' for another scene between Cid and Bro. When it's done, Cid gets his
behind down in 'C - engine room'. This is everything % completion related you
can do for now. Beam down to Thunder plains again and enter the optional
dungeon again.

'TP - new cave' - 2ND RAID ATTEMPT!

Various numbers are strewn throughout the cavern. Commit them to memory and
then combine them to open the walls that bar your progress. When you open a
wall, two chests will appear. You can choose only one - the other will vanish.
Now for a long and stretched out explanation of navigating the cave.

First, allow me to give you some tips: equip Charm Bangle (this way you will
eliminate two factors in the equations - number of battles fought and amount
of gil earned) and get a piece of paper and a pen to write down numbers you
get as you navigate the cave.

As you start, you'll notice 'No Data' box in upper left corner of the screen.
There will be another box reading '[] >> 3' in lower right corner. For now
disregard this - two chests will appear. Open either one and you'll get this
tutorial (NOTE: All numbers provided in below notes are EXAMPLES! You'll bound
to get different numbers!):

TIP1: The information needed to unlock the wall appears in the top-left and
      bottom-right corners of the screen. This information is displayed:
      - When entering the cave
      - When examining walls
      You can review the information you've gathered up to 3 times by
      pressing Square. Unlocking a wall will reset this counter back to 3.
TIP2: When examining a wall, the following information is displayed onscreen:
      Top left: Current wall's number >> [] (Key Number 1)
      Bottom right: [] >> Number of the next wall to open (Key Number 2)
      Remember these two Key Numbers!
TIP3: When you examine the next wall that needs to be opened, you'll be
      prompted to input a number. If you input the sum of Key Number 1 and
      Key Number 2, the wall will open.
      If you examine a wall out of sequence, only that wall's number will be
      displayed.
TIP4: Suppose you're trying to open Wall 3.
      When you examine it, this appears in                  3 >> []
      the top left of the screen:                            10
                                                            (Key No. 1)

      When you examined the previous wall,                  [] >> 3
      the bottom right of the screen showed:                 15
                                                            (Key No. 2)

      Since Key Number 1 for Wall 3 is 10, and Key Number 2 for Wall 3 is 15,
      inputting 25 (10 + 15 = 25) will open the wall.
TIP5: But the Key Numbers aren't always so simple. They could be the numbers
      of battles you've fought, the amount of gil you have...just about
      anything. So keep a sharp eye (especially on Yuna's ass...ets).
TIP6: When you successfully open a wall, two chests will appear. One contains
      a clue (and perhaps more) to help you through the dungeon. The other is
      empty.
      These two chests (you've just opened one) are the only exception.
      Opening either would have yielded the same result.

Select [Yes, that would help.] now.

TIP1: First let's take another look at the message you saw when you first
      entered the cave. Press Square to review the message. (Press Square)
TIP2: The number in the bottom right corner of the screen is one of the Key
      Numbers needed to open the next wall. In this case the Key Number is 6,
      and we need to open Wall 3 next.
      Split's note: Walls will *always* be opened in the same order, however,
      numbers needed will not be the same.
TIP3: The Guide Map in the top left corner of the screen will display the
      location of the next wall you need to open. Now, let's go over to Wall
      3. (Yuna automatically runs to the necessary wall)
TIP4: Press X to examine the wall. (Press X)
TIP5: The number below the wall number in the top left corner is Key Number 1
      for the current wall. So Key Number 1 for Wall 3 is 2.
      Earlier we saw that Key Number 2 for Wall 3 is 6, so the sum of the Key
      Numbers is: 2 + 6 = 8
      This sum is the code we need to input to open the wall.
      Split's note: The number below the wall number in the bottom right
      corner is Key Number 2 for the next wall. So Key Number 2 for Wall 10
      is 20.
TIP6: You will see seven 0-es. Use left/right directionals to move between
      digits and use up/down directionals to set desired numbers. Press X to
      confirm code entry or Square to cancel. In our case you'll need to
      input code of 8.
TIP7: Now that the correct code has been entered, the wall will open. After
      the wall opens, two treasure chests will appear. Any chests that
      appeared earlier will disappear. This concludes the tutorial.

Confusing? Have no fear, for handy chart is here! Walls will always be opened
in the same order applying the same formulas. However, numbers needed to open
the walls will change. I shoud explain few things about the chart below:
- walls will be listed in the way you'll be opening them
- when you enter the cave, you will be given CLUE 2 for Wall 3, so note it
- to get CLUE 1, you will have to mosey to Wall 3 and examine it
- now, add both CLUE 1 and CLUE 2 together and you get the code needed; so to
  put it bluntly, here's the beef...
- CLUE 1 (or Key Number 1 for current wall) will appear once you examine the
  wall you're supposed to open
- CLUE 2 (or Key Number 2 for next wall) will appear once you examine the
  wall you're supposed to open
- lastly, don't forget that by pressing Square you can bring up help window
  which will tell you about last two clues you've seen; you can do so for
  three times - if you attempt to see clues for fourth, game tells that you
  can't view them anymore and asks you if you'd like to exit

Okay, this is it. Also, know the two chests that appear once you successfully
open a wall? They will either open the next wall for you, tell you up to three
codes for previously opened walls, provide a hint or even a solution for next
wall you must open, tell you about number of battles you've engaged into from
time you entered the cave etc. Of course, chest may also be empty.

'TP - new cave' - 3RD RAID ATTEMPT!

Complete the exercise yet again, only this time: once you open 16th, final
wall a chest containing FORCE OF NATURE ACC will appear.

Woohoo, even more Cactuars... hopefully you started this sidequest back in
CH3? No? Awww, that's too bad. Anyway, we have the real deal now - desert is
in danger!

------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------
THE CACTUAR CONNECTION
The Ten Gatekeepers have ventured into the world proper to train. Round them
up and bring them home to the Cactuar Nation! Think you can unravel the
Cactuar Mothers' clues and sniff them out?
Objective: Find the Ten Gatekeepers
------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------

Until you complete it, there will be HS over Bikanel. For this CH we can
capture all Cactuars (or in case you have already caught up to six possible
Cactuars in CH3, only four are left to go).

To start, pay attention to minimap. Cacti that give clues to Cactuar's
whereabouts are marked as green squares and give off a green aura (please note
that N-most green cactus isn't important yet!). Carefully look at the hints
given and try to figure out where the hell it's hiding (or just look below).
When you want to leave this part of the desert, go to NE corner, examine the
vehicle and select [Yeah, it's time we left.].

1st: Back in Al Bhed Camp, talk to the pilot and select [Oasis]. Cactuar is
     here. But BEFORE you touch it, talk to the Hypello (if it appears, that
     is - if it doesn't, just go on with the game), for it sells some awesome
     acc (list of goods is found below). Now touch the Cactuar and complete
     the minigame (doesn't matter if you win) and needles are yours. Now that
     you have it, return to Al Bhed camp, talk to pilot again and this time
     select [Cactuar Nation]. Back in cactus area approach the green boxed
     one and talk with it to officially confirm the catch. Now another cactus
     will turn green... talk to it and onto 2nd Cactuar.
2nd: You'll need to pay a visit to 'B - beach'. Cactuar is taking a sunbath
     there - make sure you make a drop on it!
3rd: Guadosalam is your third destination. Enter the Chateau and go into the
     secret area where you had your last fights against the Syndicate. In one
     of the rooms you'll spot a funny chest... if you shoot the chests during
     this cact-war, you may receive an item!
4th: Calm lands - bridge between Gagazet and Calm lands screen. Here you'll
     find two Cactuars riding on a chocobo...
5th: Same as 4th Cactuar.
6th: N-most end of 'TP - north'. There's a shelter-like structure found in
     this area - look for Cactuar stone opposite of it. What's that green
     shining nearby?
7th: It's hiding all the way on Kilika. As you enter Kilika forest, go like
     this - N over the bridge, then E. Pay attention now! First tree you'll
     see bending over the water is your cue - a mark to press Circle will
     appear in lower right, so do it. Get all needles you need up here.
8th: Beam to Gagazet. If you already got Episode Complete for Gagazet, you'll
     appear near the top, in which case you need to drop down, then go right.
     Make it to 'G - prominence' - there's a spot of greenery to be found
     here. If you haven't achieved Episode Complete yet, you'll appear at the
     base of Gagazet - in this case use teleporter here, then it's just few
     more steps up until you reach the clearing mentioned before.
9th: Kilika in Dona's house. Shooting Magic Pot will occassionally award you
     with an item.

That's nine of them. Return to cactus' domain now and deliver 9th Cactuar.
Talk to 10th cactus, then address the cactus marked as red square in minimap
and pick [We'll look for him.]...

------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------
THE LAST CACTUAR
Who'd have thought the last cactuar would be so close? Use the help of the
nine gatekeepers you've already tracked down to bring that rascal home!
Objective: Find the tenth gatekeeper
------------------------------> MISSION TIME! <------------------------------

Alright, we're in at last. Save at the handy SSP, then proceed deeper into the
dungeon via the simple path. On your way you'll fight three battles (No
Encounters doesn't work here) - you can escape from first two, but you need to
win the third...

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
This is one tough battle we have at our hands, considering this tank has an
enormous DEF stat. Jobs of choice are yet again white mage and two dark
kinghts (or possibly samurai with Fingersnap ACTA). When the battle starts,
have white mage apply Protect, then keep her at standby to apply Curaga if
necessary. Meanwhile have both dark knights attack Heavy Sallet until its DEF
becomes even higher thanks to its skill.

If this becomes the case, consider following options: resort to one of many
ways to darkness Heavy Sallet, then have dark knights start executing Darkness
to inflict heavy damage on Heavy Sallet (do take care to heal them
regularly!); have samurai perform Fingersnap to nullify DEF bonus boss has
accumulated and will need to start from scratch; resort to using attack items
from your inventory - damage they do is fixed and is not affected by target's
statistics. Perhaps consider using magic as well... Ultimately, you could
simply eject Heavy Sallet.

Anyway, you can pretty much stop worrying as soon as you successfully darkness
Heavy Sallet, as it will have extreme troubles connecting with 'bash' - in
case it just might succeed, you will have protect in place to halve the
damage. Seeing as it has no MATK at its disposal, this is a fairly easy boss.

OSF is easier, but more annoying. For starters, it has lost its stupid Defense
Up move, but instead gained attacks with which it can destroy your Turbo
Ethers and Phoenix Downs. Bust it up with darkness NEGSE, then proceed wailing
on it. As it has no immunity to stat breaks, knock yourself out - oh, and try
to inflict slow on it too. Sallet's DEF stat may be high, but its MDEF stat
sucks - so using MATK against it is not a bad idea at all.
*****************************************************************************

After you waste this boss, you'll come to 1stcross - take NE path first to
grab a chest, then return to 1stcross and take SE now - continue going. On
your way you'll have to jump into sand pit - you're given 60 seconds to make
it out of the pit. You can retry as many times as you like - even if you're
caught by sands, Yuna will appear somewhere else in the dungeon unharmed. Use
the opportunity to ransack the handful of chests in this dungeon.

Just before the end of sand pit you'll need to climb two ledges, then jump
across to W ledge and from here make a jump to N ledge which also means you're
out of the sandpit! Good job! Now continue your exploration and you'll run
into 10th Cactuar which we needed to find... Outbest Frailea to obtain
COVENANT OF GROWTH GG.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
This is one of easiest boss battles I've had so far. Everything Jumbo will do
is cast Hastega on his two little buddies and then do nothing. Even when his
two buddies are in critical condition, Jumbo will happily do nothing. There's
an easy way out anyway - bring three dark knights with you at full health. All
three charge for Darkness and say bye bye to both Cactuars. Now it's only a
matter of time before Jumbo falls as well... This will be the scenario if all
cactus friends are in RGF.

Things become more fun and interesting when either of cactii enter OSF. Let's
discuss Jumbo first - it has gained abilities to cast lv2 and lv3 element
magics, as well as Flare and Demi. To make things even more challenging,
Jumbo's MATK become stronger lower its HP gets. Still, this isn't a problem.
All you have to do is set up reflect and let Jumbo kill itself. Since it
doesn't know Dispel, it'll continue to use MATK against itself (so to speak,
hehe) and eventually travel to cactus land 6 feet under.

And what about Cactuar's OSF? Funny one as well. It possesses a bunch of
Meridians, all of which inflict 100 universal damage. Chilly, Tingling,
Burning and Drowning Meridians announce usage of elemental magic in Cactuar's
next turn, while Quiet, Blinding and Maddening Meridians take care of status
fun for you. Cactuar also has new attack called 3000-Needle-Special, which
allows it to deal 1000 damage three times in a row. OSF Cactuar will not
escape from battle, and it will fight you until its miserable defeat, where
you will gain all lucky 7-s effect (take a look at its HP - okay, kidding).
Having high ACCU stat is important for your girls, should you wish to stand
any chance to hit Cactuar. Using magic is a no-go, as it has Null Magic. If
your PATK can't connect, use Darkness of dark knights or attack items from
your inventory to teach it a lesson it won't soon forget.
*****************************************************************************

Now that you have 10th Cactuar as well, make haste to the entrance of the
cave, but make sure you save before making a retreat you'd regret later.

BOSS STRATEGY
Arguably one of hardest bosses in the game, but fortunately I'm here to
uncover the beef behind this sucker and bring you the non-failing strat for
asskicking its behind back where it came from. For starters I've fought this
guy once during excavation tour - HP I took off during this encountere were
deducted from boss' total HP when I engaged in mortal battle in CH5. So it
would be advisable that you try fighting the guy multiple times in CH1, 2 or 3
to chip off as much HP as you can. Plus you can use the opportunities to steal
Megalixirs from it.

Let's discuss preparations a bit - as usual, job of choice is dark knight,
which seems to be perfect for this boss. Angra uses only one PATK, therefore
DEF isn't highest on priority list. Yes, yes, there is one other PATK Angra
can use, but it is based on MAX HP, so no matter your DEF, damage done is
fixed. But there are a lot of MATK at Angra's disposal, so you should strive
to increase MDEF. Personally I always use girls as dark knights and their
Darkness ACTA which hits everything on battlefield regardless of target's EVA
and inflicts special type damage, which isn't affected by shell or protect.
And considering one arm is immune to PATK and other to MATK, Darkness has
another plus. I'm letting you know all this for one reason - consider building
up STR as well - higher STR means more damage.

There are also some statuses you have to be prepared for - poison, silence and
darkness. Dark knight already has Poisonproof PASA, so one status is off the
list... what about other two? I consider them minor annoyance (I advise using
Darkness thru whole battle) - there have been two chances so far for you to
get Ribbon (when descending into Bevelle dungeon for the first time and during
dancing minigame aboard Celsius). If you didn't bother with them, all is not
lost. Spare 30000 gil and go buy 3x Beaded Brooch, acc which protects against
darkness and silence. There, we've taken care of status protection and what to
prioritize into.

When checking boss' elemental info, not much is new - like most bosses it's
immune to gravity damage, and left arm halves all other elements. As for
status info, don't bother - inflicting Power and Magic Break on Angra is
useless. Main part has only one PATK, which is gravity based (Power Break not
needed), while only MATK where Magic Break can be considered is Flare and
there's like 14% chance of it being used. Don't bother, I say.

Party for battle then? Alchemist (with Mega-Potion ability learned!) and two
dark knights. If alchemist is unavailable to you, then white mage (with Shell,
Protect and Curaga abilities learned) and two dark knights. As for acc
equipped, have something that boosts MDEF and STR. For items have a truckload
of Mega-Potions, Elixirs and possibly Megalixirs.

Battle commences, but the starting stages aren't easy. Immediately when your
alchemist or white mage get a turn, have alchemist Mix Potion + Lunar / Light
/ Star Curtain. Doing so will apply shell and protect for first two, as well
as reflect for last option. If you're having white mage, apply Protect first!
Angra's first move will be its PATK, which hits random targets 10 times, each
hit ripping off 18,75% target's MAX HP (even more, if chain occurs). Left arm
begins the battle by casting Glimmer of Despair, which reduces four core stats
as well as rob girls of some valuable MP.

Here's another piece of info I was able to conclude - right arm uses Bloody
Breath on each 8th turn it gets, while left arm uses Glimmer of Despair each
seventh turn. If either arm is KO-ed and then revived, amount of turns needed
before arm's special attack is executed decreases, but never later than right
arm's 8th and left arm's 7th turn. There's no sure way of knowing when Angra
itself will use its big ass attack.

Now that you've survived initial bombing, have alchemist produce Mega-Potion -
from now and ever all alchemist does is making Mega-Potions or in case that
shell & co. wear off, to reapply them. If white mage is in your party, have
her heal the bunch with Curaga (increase MAG as high as you possibly can) - be
wary of statuses wearing off! Reapply them as soon as you can. Dark knights
use Darkness and Darkness only - don't worry about their HP, it will get
restored on a reguar basis.

If you take a look at various attacks boss has, it doesn't appear to be
dangerous too much, does it? Its strength lies in speed and variety of moves.
Each time boss has a turn, you have 56% chances for boss using non-damaging
attack. You can increase that percentage even higher by fluently using
Darkness and taking care not to run out of HP. Boss will be so busy reviving
dead arms, that he may forget about us. I suggest to be careful of Flare,
which is the only moderate damage spell Angra has to offer. Dispel boss packs
is used even less - nevertheless, be on the lookout for it.

Short recap of this lengthy paragraph: Party to use are two dark knights and
alchemist (or white mage). At start of battle apply protect ASAP, then dark
knights keep using Darkness only, whilst third girl takes care to heal on
regular basis and reapply helpful statuses once they wear off... *puts a hole
between Angra's eyes* One dead optional boss, coming right up!

The easiest way of winning this battle is to drain Angra's MP. Use Soul or
Mana Springs, gunner's Target MP, samurai's Magicide, thief's Pilfer MP or gun
mage's Absorb. Once Angra is out of MP, all it can do is a weak Osmose attack.
Knock out both Tawrich and Zarich as well. Now all you need to do is drain
Angra's MP every once in a while (that is, if its Osmose actually drains some
of girls' MP), while the remainder of YRP team keeps chipping off Angra's HP.
*****************************************************************************

Completing this mission awards MERCURIAL STRIKE GG and EPISODE COMPLETE!

Now you have access to all excavation sites except for 'Central expanse'. So,
how do we gain entrance...? Simple, all you gotta do is send any level chocobo
to Bikanel (preferably one you don't need). It'll run away, but in return you
now have access to 'Central expanse'. This dig is different - you are doing it
on a chocobo. What you're really here for is to dig on white X spots -
eventually you'll run across DESERT KEY KEY ITEM, with which you can unlock
the chest in Al Bhed camp and nab HORN OF PLENTY GG.

Also, if you return to Cactuar Nation, you'll see a scene with Benzo and
Marnela. After it ends, address Marnela yet again. Entrance to Cactuar Hollow
is now sealed, but there's an army of Cactuars in the middle of Cactuar Nation
- you can challenge them to cact-war yet again. If you missed your chance to
get Covenant of Growth GG, challenge Frailea and beat it.

in the scene that will follow YOU MUST SEE ISAARU! Regardless of who you sided
with you receive EPISODE COMPLETE! And SCOURGEBANE GG to boot!

Afterwards beam down to Bevelle again and enter the 'B - trials' by taking the
lift in 'New Yevon HQ 1'. Of course, don't forget to examine lower pedestal in
'New Yevon HQ 4'. Refer to one of earlier bonus stuff sections for
directions... all items listed in above checklist (except for GG and two
Crimson Spheres) are found in chests!

Lastly, enter 'New Yevon HQ 3' - you'll find brat group and a strange
teleport... This sidequest mission is covered in section 22. Complete the
mission by defeating 2nd boss of Lv100 and you get what we call MISSION
COMPLETE! Your objective right now is to proceed forward to see a scene with
an old geezer. Collect CRIMSON SPHERE 6 KEY ITEM. Pick [I can't wait!] to
watch the sphere.

Now make it to floor 20 and waste Aranea. Pick up CRIMSON SPHERE 8 KEY ITEM
which will be left behind (make sure you watch it as soon as you're aboard
Celsius!). Optionally, try to reach floor 40 and fight Black Elemental. If it
proves too tough, here are three cheesy ways to defeat it: Bribe it with 65000
gil, use Spare Change of around 250000 gil, or have dark knight with at least
5000 MAX HP use Charon. Boss dead, you get MOON BRACER ACC, SHINING BRACER
ACC, SPEED BRACER ACC, RECOVERY BRACER ACC and CAT NIP ACC. Cat Nip is awarded
to you if you're playing US version - those who are playing japanese version
will receive Enterprise instead.

Bosses of 60th and 80th floor don't leave anything behind. Damn. However,
should you manage to waste both Paragon and Mr T. on 100th floor, you get IRON
DUKE ACC, best piece of equipment in entire game IMO.

And although not needed, you must be warned - DO NOT SKIP ANY SCENES WHILE IN
VIA INFINITO. THIS INCLUDES THE SCENES OF PEOPLE CHANGING INTO THEIR BOSS
FORMS. SKIP ONE SCENE AND WAVE 100% GOODBYE.

Note: If you're able to get both companies to lv5 before getting EPCOM for
Calm lands, you'll be able to buy all of the stuff mentioned above.

Still, if you were unsuccessful in gaining enough points to bring one company
to lv5, all is not lost. You can play minigames for the company you're
advertising for until you accrue 400+ points. Now beam to Celsius and talk to
MN - Calm lands will become a HS and you can get Episode Complete!

Contributor SixDays says: If you ask the PR questions to everybody in a
certain CH, then go switch companies, and you can ask all the people in that
chapter the questions again, and get the credit for the other company. Meaning
there is way over 1005 points possible by asking people questions. The answers
to the questions all stay the same, you just have to do it in the same CH. I
think I switched in the end of chapter 3 and noticed this. You don't get
double points for marriage questions though. Only smart to do it once though,
since you lose half your PR points.

What about bridal chappie? Y'know, this sidequest really sucks. The best you
can get is lousy Speed Bracer? Okay, so here are the scores: for 0-29 points
you get ELIXIR, and for any score exceeding 30 points you're awarded SPEED
BRACER ACC.

When his son runs off (or not, if you got him a bride or four), talk to the
father again and he'll ask about 50000 gil he's missing (only if you watched
whole CALM LANDS 1 CAM until it's been eaten). Choose first, honest option and
you obtain SWORD LORE ACC.

As for item collecting, everything listed in inside the chests, so knock
yourself out. To score AURORA RAIN KEY ITEM, you will have to visit 'CL -
cavern' and teleport of fayth chamber. Nab the chest here.

To get another EPISODE COMPLETE for this area, you must uncover a secret
dungeon which is found in 'CL - facility ruins', by doing following process.
Please note that process works with other chocobos as well, but this is how I
got access to the dungeon, so I know my way works.

I keep getting mails that you don't need bold chocobos, the other areas work
just as well and so on. Know what? I'm really not in the mood to check out all
possible ways - there's like hundreds of possibilities. Would you be willing
to test them all out? If you cannot be bothered to try my process listed here,
you're welcome to try you own ways. Just don't write mails to me asking how to
open the dungeon, cos what you tried didn't work...

I state once again: Process described below GUARANTEES you'll get Ruin Depths
dungeon. Make even one deviation from the process and you'll screw yourself in
the long run.

STEP 01: You'll need four lv1 bold chocobos.
STEP 02: The areas where they often appear are Kilika, Bikanel or Thunder p.
STEP 03: Go to any of these areas and begin capturing chocobos until you have
         14 of them.
STEP 04: Return to the ranch and examine all chocobos you've captured by
         'talking' to them in the stables. Release all chocobos whose max lv
         can be 4 or lower. KEEP ONLY FOUR BOLD CHOCOBOS WHO CAN BE RAISED TO
         LV5! If you don't have enough of such chocobos, return to areas I
         mentioned and resume capturing.
STEP 05: You have four bold chocobos that can be raised to lv5? Good!
STEP 06: DO NOT RAISE THEM YET! Instead assign them to be your Runners.
STEP 07: Dispatch all four of them to Calm lands.
STEP 08: ONLY DISPATCHING THEM TO CALM LANDS WILL WORK!
STEP 09: Go fight 7 random battles, then return to the ranch and SAVE before
         talking to Clasko.
STEP 10: Talk to Clasko and make sure that all four lv1 bold chocobos made it
         back. If any ran away, reload.
STEP 11: Now raise all four lv1 bold chocobos into lv2 bold chocobos. Don't
         forget to restore their Heart!
STEP 12: Dispatch all four of them to Calm lands. ONLY CALM LANDS!
STEP 13: Go fight 7 random battles, then return to the ranch and SAVE before
         talking to Clasko.
STEP 14: Talk to Clasko and make sure that all four lv2 bold chocobos made it
         back. If any ran away, reload.
STEP 15: Now raise all four lv2 bold chocobos into lv3 bold chocobos. Don't
         forget to restore their Heart!
STEP 16: Dispatch all four of them to Calm lands. ONLY CALM LANDS!
STEP 17: Go fight 7 random battles, then return to the ranch and SAVE before
         talking to Clasko.
STEP 18: Talk to Clasko and make sure that all four lv3 bold chocobos made it
         back. If any ran away, reload.
STEP 19: Now raise all four lv3 bold chocobos into lv4 bold chocobos. Don't
         forget to restore their Heart!
STEP 20: Dispatch all four of them to Calm lands. ONLY CALM LANDS!
STEP 21: Go fight 7 random battles, then return to the ranch and SAVE before
         talking to Clasko.
STEP 22: Talk to Clasko and make sure that all four lv4 bold chocobos made it
         back. If any ran away, reload.
STEP 23: Now raise all four lv4 bold chocobos into lv5 bold chocobos. Don't
         forget to restore their Heart!
STEP 24: Now pay attention! Send out only Runners 1, 2 and 3 to Calm lands.
         Keep Runner 4 at standby!
STEP 25: Go fight 7 random battles, then return to the ranch and SAVE before
         talking to Clasko.
STEP 26: Talk to Clasko and make sure that all three Runners you sent out
         made it back. If any ran away, reload.
STEP 27: Restore any and all lost Heart!
STEP 28: Again, pay attention! This time send out only Runners 2, 3 and 4 to
         Calm lands. Keep Runner 1 at standby!
STEP 29: Go fight 7 random battles.
STEP 30: This time when you go back to the ranch, a scene will issue in which
         Clasko tells girls that chocobos have discovered something in the
         back of the ranch and would like you to go check it out.
STEP 31: Entrance to the dungeon will appear as a green square on the
         minimap. Have fun!

Tch, this is a fairly complex area - no minimap to guide you thru. There is a
nice map of the area available for viewing at GameFAQs. Here's the link:

db.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/file/final_fantasy_x_2_chocobo_dungeon.gif

I advise equipping Charm Bangle here to avoid random battles (there's Ultima
Weapon roaming down here - you sure you wanna fight it?). On the other hand,
enemies drop nice EXP, so you may wish to fight instead. Anyway, check item
checklist for items you can nab - you should esp be interested into MACHINA
REACTOR KEY ITEM and THE ABC'S OF REPAIR KEY ITEM. Somewhere in the back of
the ruins familiar fiend resides.

If Anything Eater oversouls, it loses Auto-Reflect properties.

1. <Lv3 element magic> - VS one chr - respective type of mgd
2. 'Smack' - VS one chr - phd, induces KO
3. Flare - NATT VS one chr - mgd
4. Osmose - VS all chrs - MP stolen is added to Eater's MP
5. [Me no like dressphere!] - charge up move for [Tired of...] - will attack
   girls wearing that DSP four times
6. [Tired of that dressphere!] - will focus any further attacks on picked DSP
7. [Dispel] - VS all chrs - shatters most POSSE
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
A boss with innate reflect? If you've already had experience with such guys,
then you know the drill - it'll cast magic on itself to have it bounce onto
your girls. Prior to battle equip stuff that guards or absorbs elemental
damage, as boss relies heavily on magic. Also have dark knights with
Deathproof PASA learned, for Eater's 'smack' carries KO. Or equip Angel
Earrings.

Since it has such small amount of MP, steal it - Mana Spring, Steal MP etc.
Just about anything will do. Do note that boss will use Osmose to regain lost
MP, but just drain it back again - and so we enter the endless cycle. Boss'
Flare is especially strong and getting KO-ed cos of it won't come as surprise.
Anyway, make sure you're protected against KO and that you can absorb as many
elements as possible and this fight is as good as won.

OSF Eater is similar to its Chocobo buddy an many ways. OSF battle is IMO even
easier than 'regular' battle. Eater will start the battle by making a move
called 'Me no like dressphere!' - afterwards it will launch four PATK against
the girl wearing chosen DSP. After those four attacks it may switch back to
flurry of MATK (set up reflect to have spells bounce back at Eater) or decide
to continue being tired of certain DSP. Don't forget that protect can be
helpful here as well. Reducing boss' MAG stat will be useful in reducing
damage it does with its MATK. I suggest having Star Bracers equipped to have
Auto-Reflect on yourself - that way Eater will waste many turns trying to cast
Dispel which won't work.
*****************************************************************************

After winning this fight, examine the wall behind place of battle - the wall
will rise. Behind that wall is a corridor which seems to lead nowhere - but
don't let that to confuse you. Remember the wall you approached before? Wall
moved away and you engaged in the battle against Eater? Seek out four more
walls like this one - two are to the left of 'eater-wall' and two are to the
right of 'eater-wall'. Once you manage to rise all five walls, go to the
middle of the corridor at far N end and examine N wall. It will move away,
revealing your grand prize. You also score HIGHER POWER GG.

There's four more GG you can obtain:
- send any level choc whose Heart stat ISN'T 100 to any area and go fight
  seven random battles; when such choc returns, there's a small chance you
  might score either MOUNTED ASSAULT GG or STRENGTH OF ONE GG
- you must get either Open Air or Argent to Lv5 publicity before CH5 - when
  you do, visit Calm Lands and get Episode Complete!; if you helped Open Air
  reach Lv5, you'll be able to buy DISASTER IN BLOOM GG; if you helped
  Argent, there's FLASH OF STEEL GG available for buying; getting *both* Open
  Air and Argent to Lv5 publicity before CH5 is hard work and I don't
  recommend it

4. Blizzaga - IATT VS one chr - ice mgd
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
Dark S. will be the toughest of dark bastards you've fought so far. Her
Heavenly Strike poses major threat - halving both target's HP/MP as well as
inducing stop you're gonna have serious problems in handling her. Kick does
about 400 damage to one and Blizzaga 500 damage to one as well, while Diamond
Dust will strike all for 1000 damage (this is not ice based attack!; Diamond
Dust inflicts non-elemental mgd). Bring Stopproof acc with you in the battle,
or change into thieves (thief has Stopproof PASA). Otherwise white mage with
two dark knights is recommended party.

Start by white mage applying shell, then casting Curaga - screw shell's
disadvantage of halving healing effects or switch to Mega-Potions then. Don't
forget to remove stop or you'll be sorry! Dark knights will prolly have
problems hitting Dark S., so you may consider using Darkness instead. Another
option that might seem favorable is breaking Dark S. in STR and MAG to
decrease the damage she's doing with Diamond Dust and Blizzaga, as well as her
'kick'. Keep at it and soon Dark S. will fall too. I'm sure Dark S. doesn't
have any fixed attack pattern, so you will have to rely on your instincts for
this one.

BOSS STRATEGY
Hardest bastards in the regular storyline IMO. I had so many friggin' problems
beating those three, esp cos of high EVA of Dark M. and Dark Sa. Make sure you
have a full supply of Mega-Potions or X-Potions, and that someone is able to
cast Protect and Shell (must equip right acc). Recommended would be to enter
this battle with 3 dark knights, but if you are in need of white mage, switch
one in instead.

I tell you right now, battle will not be easy! As already pointed out, Sa.'s
and M.'s insane EVA, coupled with high AGL stat will make a lot of gray hair
grow on you. Immediately start by having white mage cast Protect and Shell on
all three, while one or both dark knights attack C. Yep, even though she has
highest HP (although not by that much), I consider her most annoying of the
bunch. She'll constantly try to bestow protect and shell statuses on herself
and two sisters, and nothing pisses me off more in this battle. Use *anything*
it takes to clear off C. first... even though you have to throw your most
powerful items (will get to that later).

Now C. will mostly cast protective magic, while M. will be annoying you with
her Passado. Remember, Passado can't kill you, but it does put you in very low
HP, allowing excellent chance for Sa. to use Razzia to finish weakened gal
off. Or M. will follow up with one of her Lv3 element spells, which pack a
punch (about 600 damage per cast). Sa.'s Razzia and normal PATK hit between
120 and 300 damage. If you take too long in clearing one sister off the
battlefield, say hi to Delta Attack, which reduces HP of all girls to 1 measly
HP. HEAL IMMEDIATELY!

You say you have problems hitting sisters? I have two alternatives prepared.
First is to throw attack type items from your stock. Even though they may be
weak, these items hit all enemies with 100% probability and damage will
slowly, but surely pile up. Or resort to using dark knight's Darkness attack,
which also falls into category of attacks sisters cannot avoid. Don't forget
to keep your HP in the clear or else you may find yourself suddenly very weak.

After C. has been dispatched, it's time to go after M. Thanks solely to her
EVA it may take some turns before she falls, but persevere and you will
succeed. Now only Sa. remains, and on her own she's not much of a threat.

One quick way to take Dark M. out is to get samurai learn Spare Change and
throwing aroud 300000 gil against Dark M. to instakill her. This will make the
remainder of this battle a breeze.
*****************************************************************************

Return to SSP from before and save your game. Continue your advance deeper
into the underground, but this time be careful of how far you jump. Before you
reach next circular platform, make sure you're healed up, as next boss is not
easy...

1. 'Stare' - STATT VS one chr - std, induces poison
2. Pain - NATT VS one chr - mgd, induces silence, poison, itchy and
   [decreases STR, MAG, DEF, MDEF, ACCU & EVA by -1 level]
3. Oblivion - NATT VS all chrs - mgd, 16 hits
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
A.'s 'stare' will deal some damage and poison target girl, while Pain is a
class of its own. It won't KO the girl hit, but will put all kinds of nasty
statuses onto her... to name a few: silence, poison, itchy and stat decreases
(if you'll take too long in killing Dark A., effects will stack with every
subsequent Pain and make girl living weakling). Then we have to worry about
Oblivion as well.

So here are damage estimates: 'stare' 300 to one, Pain 250 to one and Oblivion
600 damage to all. Not much, eh? But thanks to statuses you'll be accompanied
with during battle you won't rest even one bit. Did I mention that it has
36000 HP, making the fight last forever?

Okay, two dark knights and white mage. It's my the-usual-tech routine, but
this time protect is fairly useless, while shell is an excellent choice to put
on all girls from start of battle, then just keep attacking until someone is
hit by Pain. Now immediately throw Remedy on affected girl to remove nasty
changes preventing hit girl from even acting. Poison caused by 'stare' I
recommend to be shrugged off - what's the point in healing it, if you'll just
be affected again? If you're using dark knights, that's not even something you
should be worried about, as dark knight has Poisonproof PASA.

Unfortunately I'm sure that Dark A. doesn't have a fixed attack pattern -
there's also no clear indicator as to when she's to use Oblivion (except that
charging animation is longer than usual). Always make sure your HP is above
1500 (just to be on safe side) and take whatever punishment comes flying your
way. When scene is over, continue attacking (don't forget to heal your wounds,
of course!) until A. is defeated.
*****************************************************************************

Finally we've defeated all dark bastards. Your victory over Dark A. yields
IMMORTAL SOUL GG. After a scene Yuna will be in a flower field. Look who's
here... another scene. SSP at last - make sure you save. You've come a long
way and beating the crap out of Dark A. I can't stand again. If you need
healing items, talk to LB. and choose [Can we buy something off you?].

Not so fast in that portal!!! GO BACK TO THE AIRSHIP! Talk to Shinra to start
a scene. Then go anywhere else on the ship, and back to the bridge. Hm, where
are Buddy and Bro? Ride the elevator to 'C - deck' for another scene (this one
can only be viewed if your % completion is 70% or more). AL BHED PRIMER KEY
ITEM is yours. Back to 'C - cabin' for another scene - when you're offered to
make a choice, pick whatever suits you (this scene can only be viewed if your
% completion is 80% or more). Now visit Celsius' areas like this - Bridge,
Cabin, Bridge. This time Rikku will be missing from the bridge. Head for the
Deck and speak with Rikku up here (you'll need 95% or more completion for this
one to be seen).

If you have trouble seeing any of these scenes, go talk to MN so that Mission
Select screen pops up, then immediately cancel so that you return to the
bridge - doing so should cause the effect you want. And of course make sure
first that you have required % completion.

To obtain GG that allows you to cast Ultima, you need to make it to 'Farplane
abyss' using each of the five routes. Besaid, Kilika, Bevelle and Calm lands
are very easy, while Djose route involves a slight puzzle involving stone
pushing. When you come across it, this is what you do - push leftmost stone
towards number 3, rightmost stone towards number 1, and middle stone towards
number 2. As for the items you can nail on these routes - bah! Not worth your
time.

Upon descending into Farplane using the fifth route and upon reaching the
stone platform where you fought Dark A. before, a scene will unfold showing
Yuna obtaining MEGIDDO GG. Go Yuna!

When you think you're ready, head for 'Farplane abyss' and try to enter the
portal - choose [Yes.]. You have two ways of doing this section, slowly or
with your head thru the wall. I prefer the latter, but it's extremely tough
(unless you know the trick), as you'll soon see.

WAY OF THE CALM...

Once scene is finished, notice the piano to your left. There's an electric
barrier to your right that is activated every so often. If you get caught in
current, gals suffer some damage. There's also 1st blue spot on the ground
near the piano - step on it and three notes will be played. Now examine the
piano and punch in these three notes (use the hint at bottom of screen).

With first barrier out of the way, go N - path branches off into two at
1stcross. Take W one and step on 2nd blue spot on your way to hear two notes
(don't get struck by electricity!), while E path's 3rd blue spot gives away
one note. Where paths merge back together (2ndcross), make a jump to the
chest. Nearby is 2nd piano, but before activating it take path to SE of the
piano to reach 4th blue spot. Now you have all the notes you need to play on
2nd piano. Do it and another barrier has been destroyed. Get MEGALIXIR from
nearby chest.

Hop back on main track and go N until you reach 3rdcross - take left path
first and step on 5th blue spot to hear two notes. Now back to 3rdcross and
take right path - immediately after electric current jump down onto another
road. First go up a bit to step on 6th blue spot, which gives away one note.
Hike to other end of this path and step on 7th blue spot for two more notes.
You'll automatically jump back down on left path from 3rdcross. Go N until two
paths merge again at 4thcross. Jump to your right and find 3rd piano (loot a
chest near it for 3x TURBO ETHER). Third barrier is deactivated, so proceed N
for more scenes. You get PAINE'S SPHERE KEY ITEM.

Make use of SSP here. This next puzzle is so friggin' annoyin'... I don't feel
like explaining it, so just follow these directions, okay? Let's begin...

There are two starting stones, one to the left of SSP, one to the right of
SSP. Jump on stone to the left of SSP to be transported a bit up. When it
stops, jump to the right - three notes are played. Jump right to be
transported a bit up. Jump up, and up again to hear two more notes. Now jump
all the way back to SSP. Now take stone to the right of SSP, which will
transport you up again. Jump on the block that is more N to transport yourself
to another big block - this one plays one note. Back to SSP again, and again
jump on block to the left of SSP.

When it stops, jump left, then up. When this block stops, jump right to hear
one note. Jump left and block you previously used will float even higher. Jump
right, loot the chest with 2x MEGA PHOENIX, then jump up to hear two notes.
Jump down, left and you'll be transported down. Jump down, then immediately
back up. As block stops, jump left and left again to hear one note. Jump back
to SSP. Take block to the right of SSP yet again. When it stops, jump left on
the block that is more S - you will reach a block that plays two notes.
Finally, jump left and stand on circular shape which will play the notes in
order you stepped on. Beware, if you screwed up, you will fight very strong
boss (but you can escape from it and try to do the puzzle again). If you were
successful in clearing the puzzle, door deactivates and access is granted.

WAY OF THE HEAD THRU THE WALL...

After the scene make your way N and N only - to pass electric barriers, wait
for them until they detract, and as for lasers, press Circle to jump over them
just as security orb is about to shoot you. Approach the first circular... er,
'door' or whatever...

BOSS STRATEGY
Hey look, a challenging boss! But they made a tiny mistake... fortunately it
can be ejected, this making one of quickest vistories ever (you will have to
keep trying lots of times to eject it, anyway). Or how about Spare Change by
samurai? I'll try to assist you in nailing it with whatever you have at your
disposal.

Azi doesn't kid around and from the attacks it's using you'll soon realize
that as well. 'Swipe' does about 1000 to one (it also has drain effect,
meaning whatever HP damage your girl took, same amount of HP will be recovered
by Azi), Bated Breath around 4000 to one. Before battle begins, concentrate on
beefing up HP, DEF and STR as high as you can. Less damage boss does with its
PATK, better for you. As for your team, they'll be dealing biggest damage to
Azi using PATK, so that's why you want to have high STR. Don't bother with
EVA, for even with 255 EVA Azi will still hit you.

Team of choice? White mage for sure, while I'll leave other two girls to have
the job you think has greatest relation between HP, DEF and STR (most likely
warrior, samurai or dark knight). Also go to main menu and choose ATB speed to
be the lowest - you'll need the time to make right decisions. Azi doesn't
follow any fixed attacks patterns, unfortunately for us.

Battle commences - white mage immediately applies protect, and is then put on
standby to aid girls in need. If you have any items lying around such as Light
Curtains or Chocobo Wings, use them - whatever POSSE you're under, it's always
a good one to have. Whatever jobs you chose for other two girls, have them use
their strongest attacks: dark knight Black Sky, samurai Sparkler, and warrior
whatever (Excalibur might be strongest of them all). Always maintain your HP
above 50%, as Damocles Photon deals damage based on MAX HP, and if your HP is
below 50%, girl is KO-ed. If Bated Breath is used and it's not white mage that
got KO-ed, have white mage use Full-Life, otherwise you'll have to rely on
Phoenix Down + X-Potion combo. If none got KO-ed, heal the team with either
Mega-Potion or Megalixir.

If Azi recovers HP faster than you can damage it, I suggest giving up on it
for now as you may be too weak to kill it. Unlike most boss battles, it is
possible to escape from this one.

OSF battle is quite easier IMO. Azi starts by using 'Eyeing' move against a
randomly picked girl. There's no paramater that prompts Azi to select a girl,
it's random. Anyway, once girl is selected, Azi will launch four PATK or three
PATK followed by Curse or Bated Breath. After taking three hits and finishing
current 'Eyeing' attack flurry, it'll use Photon against your team and reduce
your HP by 50% MAX HP. Luckily Azi no longer recovers HP each time he
successfully connects with PATK, and it can frequently miss.

WAY OF THE CALM... & WAY OF THE HEAD THRU THE WALL... NOW JOIN FORCES!

This is almost it... just another stroll up the linear path, which involves a
lot of jumping. One more scene will be triggered. When it's finished, head
back down and save your progress. Also, if you finally managed to oversoul
every oversoulable enemy in the game, talk to Shinra to receive fabulous THE
END GG.

Finally make all preparations you need then head on over to Farplane's final
area, where the place of last encounter awaits - head on up and keep going
until you make it to your first final target.

1. Noli Me Tangere - VS all chrs - 1250 of fixed phd
2. 'Laser' - FRATT VS one chr - fractional std, tears off 31,25% MAX HP
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
Before start of battle make sure girls' HP is 1250 or higher. Why? When tail
gets first attack, it'll use 'sweep', which deals 1250 of fixed phd to all
three girls (can be halved with protect). After you survive that attack,
you'll be seeing 'laser' mostly, which reduces one girl's HP by 31,25% MAX HP.
So, the strategy?

Bring in two dark knights and white mage. Protect on all girls at start of
battle, then keep the health up with Curaga on all girls (if hit by 'sweep')
or one girl (if hit by 'laser'). Dark knights attack Tail relentlessly. It is
highly unlikely that white mage would by any chance become unable to keep up
with HP lost due to Tail's attacks - but in the event of this happening
anyway, assign one dark knight on temporary healing duty with help of Mega-
Potions. First ignition has been fired, time for second!
*****************************************************************************

After kicking its tail, path forward is free. You're also free to return to
the SSP and save your progress. When you feel like continuing, return and
proceed deeper into enemy territory...

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
Bring in two dark knights and white mage and have an ample supply of Mega-
Potions handy. Cast only Shell on all girls at start of battle, then keep
healing with Mega-Potions *each* and every turn. Many attacks that are
launched in your direction can be reflected back to caster, so setting up
reflect POSSE is not a bad idea. Dark knights attack Arm relentlessly. It's
very likely that white mage will be unable to keep up with HP lost due to huge
amount of attacks thrown your way, so help out occassionally by assigning one
dark knight on healing duty with Mega-Potions. Don't forget to recast Shell
once the effect wears off. It's also very helpful if you equip acc that absorb
element damage as HP recovered.

If Arm gets accustomed to too many POSSE at once (ie regen, shell, protect),
be sure to dispel it ASAP. But don't bother with it if only one POSSE has been
bestowed - not worth the effort. And you prolly wonder how I got EXP and gil
counts for orbs? I needed to throw several millions of gil before I've killed
single orb. Imagine how long would it take with normal PATK or MATK (a very
long time, for orbs pack insane DEF and MDEF). Killing the orbs is not
recommended anyway - 300000 HP for 8K of EXP and 3K of gil. No thanks.
*****************************************************************************

After kicking its arm, path further forward is free. Return once again to save
your game at last SSP. This really is the last time you can do so. Back up
engage in third battle...

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
In first playthru I thought this boss battle was hard. But looking at it with
my powerpuff girls which can withstand just about anything, I can say it's not
hard at all. Before you enter the battle, equip acc that guard against
petrification and poison (or enter battle as dark knights who have relevant
PASA skills). As you can see from attacks of both Bulwarks, many of them don't
inflict direct damage, except occassional 'slam' from right Bulwark. Break and
Bio will be rendered useless, and doom NEGSE followed from same magic can
easily be countered with quick Phoenix Down. And finally Core needs at least
four turns to charge enough before it can release its super attack.

So let's do battle - bring in three dark knights (and just in case keep white
mage DSP in one of nearby nodes on GG - we may need it). I wouldn't bother
casting protective POSSE on yourself as one Bulwark knows Dispel and will
successfully waste your effort. Also don't bother using magic in this battle -
I find it a waste of time and MP. Left Bulwark's role is to make your life
difficult by trying to inflict NEGSE on your girls, while right Bulwark's job
is to provide support for its allies. In order to prevent that, it's
recommended that right Bulwark dies first. When either Bulwark is dead, this
stops Core from charging its attack and prompts it to start charging Full-Life
instead. Core will only forfeit that if it has already charged for three
times. So in order to never see Core's Memento Mori, clear off both Bulwarks
ASAP. As soon as one gets revived, kill it again. As long as you keep KO-ed
Bulwarks... well, KO-ed, I guarantee you'll never see Memento Mori. You
wouldn't even need to heal ever if you follow these suggestions. Keeping
Bulwarks KO-ed also prevents them from launching 'detected' type attacks.

If inspite all the protection you have it still happens that Core enters post-
third-charge phase, you have a problem and we need to counter it. Quickly
change one girl into white mage and have her cast Shell to halve the damage
from Memento Mori. Or if you have any Lunar Curtains handy, use one! After you
take damage, heal your girls immediately. One more tip concerning right
Bulwark - only bother dispeling protect if it's been induced on either of
enemies in this battle. Shell and regen can safely be shrugged off.
*****************************************************************************

After defeating the core, girls' HP/MP is fully restored. When scene is
finished, girls engage in fourth battle...

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
I thought I was to fight that huge cannon you see in the sequence, heh.
Anyway, you're almost there. For this battle Head must fall, but where the
heck is the target entry for it? You must kill both Redoubts off at least once
before you're able to target Head. As soon as Head is legit target, Redoubts
get revived at same time... I advise to keep them away by killing them again -
attacks they chuck your way are fairly annoying.

Three dark knights will do the job successfully yet again. During first half
of battle (when you can't target Head yet) girls will be attacked by frequent
Pallida Mors, which inflicts moderate mgd to one girl. As Redoubts are able to
revive each other, I recommend using multihit attacks, such as Darkness. What
you should aim for is that both Redoubts are KO-ed at same time. As soon as
this is met, Head will appear for targeting. And soon your headaches will
begin as well.

For second phase of battle I wouldn't worry about having too much POSSE on you
- one of Redoubts knows Dispel, so why bother anyway? Dark knights have
Poisonproof and Stoneproof PASA, thus successfully shrugging off two NEGSE
that are frequently used in this battle. Pallida Mors is no longer used, and
the other HP reducing attacks that are left are Demi, Flare, Mors Certa and
Nemo Ante Mortem Beatus - latter is extremely rare and I've only been able to
get it to be used twice. I dunno what exactly triggers it, but be advised -
damage it does is indeed great, so either have full HP or equip acc that have
Auto-Shell AAB. There's still Lacrimosa attacks, but both are laughable.

Did you know that Redoubts have fixed attack pattern in 2nd half? Here it is:
Right: Lacrimosa, Blind, Flare, Break, Full-Life anywhere inbetween (if other
Redoubt KO-ed)
Left: Lacrimosa, Slow, Dispel, Demi, Full-Life anywhere inbetween (if other
Redoubt KO-ed)

Darkness and silence NEGSE you might also get? Curing silence is useless
(unless you're relying on white mages, but I don't find them exactly useful
for this battle), and if darkness bothers you, use dark knight's Darkness
attack instead - it hits everything on battlefield with 100% accuracy.
Anything else you might wish to know? Tag along to final battle then...

CHAPTER 5 COMPLETE!

Do not discard your controller just yet! There's still more to be done. As
soon as you see a scene with Yuna walking thru field of flowers, give your X
button a mash of the lifetime. If all of the requirements for perfect ending
were met, and you followed my guide by the letter (which means you just
attained 100% in one playthru), you will be asked a question. Choose [Yes!]
and perfect ending is yours to view. Or choose [It's better this way.] if you
don't wish to view it - but you've come this far, so I don't see a reason why
would you want to select this one.

Anyway, after your selection is done, you'll view a CGI sequence, after which
game's ending credits will roll. Do not turn PS2 off yet! After credits are
finished, one more CGI sequence is initiated. Believe it or not, there's
*still* more. One final scene at Zanarkand will be shown - *this* is the
perfect ending scene only attainable thru 100% and meeting few prerequisites.

Finally, your current game's % completion, number of times you've beaten the
game, and levels your gals finished the game at, are shown. Press X to advance
to New Game Plus data creation screen. Choose [Yes.] to create New Game Plus
save - I recommend creating extra save.

-------------------- A - DRESSPHERE INTRODUCTION - G1301 --------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

So what exactly is a a DSP (dressphere)? Long story short, it is classified
as a job, or class. By finding various DSP (14 DSP are usable by all girls,
and 1 SDSP unique to each girl, total of 17 DSP) and inserting them into GG
girls have the opportunity at the end of your fingertips to almost freely
change classes in the heat of battle by a simple press of L1. After selecting
DSP you wish to change into girl undergoes the change and after animation is
finished, it's ass kicking time!


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
----------------------- B - HOW TO EQUIP DSP? - G1302 -----------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

1. First step is to press Triangle to enter main menu, then select Garment
   Grid heading to be taken to the submenu, where all of GG you've obtained
   so far are piled up.

2. Why would you need GG, you ask? Well, without GG equipped you wouldn't be
   able to switch jobs in battle. Or put down in blunt way: Having GG with at
   least one DSP inserted into it is a necessity. You can't even leave the
   menu if this requirement is not met.

3. Move thru the list with up/down, or press L2/R2 to scroll thru the list.
   Note how there are varying amount of empty slots and strange symbols on
   every GG you view? Empty slots are called NODES, whereas strange symbols
   are referred to as GATES. You use nodes to insert DSP into them. Gates
   grant special properties to the girl when girl passes thru the gate as a
   result of dresschange.

4. Once you select GG you wish to rearrange, press X and DSP list will
   appear, containing all DSP you've found so far (if GG in question is
   already being equipped on one of the girls, you'll get a warning asking
   you if you really wish to continue - select yes to proceed or no to
   cancel).

5. Move thru DSP list with up/down, or press L2/R2 to scroll thru the list.
   Press Circle at desired DSP you wish to insert into GG - now cursor jumps
   at one of the available nodes. Set DSP with X, cancel selection with
   Circle, or remove already inserted DSP with Triangle.

6. At the bottom of DSP list three commands are displayed. For their
   explanation refer to this section - press CTRL + F and type in this
   phrase, without the asterisks: *ALPHA1001*.

7. Once you're done inserting DSP, press Circle to leave this submenu. Now
   continue inserting DSP into other GG or press Circle again to return to
   main menu.


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
----------------------- C - HOW TO CHANGE DSP? - G1303 ----------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

You can do so in two ways - outside of battle in main menu (way A), or inside
battle by accessing GG menu on girl's turn by pressing L1 button (way B).

1. MAIN MENU - First gain access to main menu by pressing Triangle - from
   (WAY A)     here select Equipment heading, followed by Dressphere entry.
               It is used to change jobs for the girl. You'll be taken to an
               overview of GG currently equipped - it will also display all
               DSP inserted into that GG. Move the cursor about and press
               X to change the job or Circle to cancel.
             - Pay attention to girl's stats and MCW. Many of the jobs
               drastically change stats and may add new commands to girl's
               MCW - of course, it may also delete or replace them, so be
               careful. Various explanations of MCW commands are found in
               section 14, Dressphere abilities.

2. IN BATTLE - On any of girl's turns press L1 to be taken to that girl's
   (WAY B)     equipped GG. It will be displayed on most of the screen, while
               in upper right corner you will be able to view flow of battle
               in a minimized window. Choose one of DSP (which *isn't* DSP
               currently equipped) and press X to have the girl change into
               new job. You can only select DSP that are one link away from
               currently equipped DSP (gates aren't included in this
               equation).
             - If the job change causes the girl to take a pass thru one of
               the gates on GG, then she may be bestowed with a special
               effect, like gaining new spell, gaining element properties to
               her PATK or increasing certain statistics. Detailed info on
               special effects granted are discussed in Garment Grid section
               of this guide.


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
---------------------- D - INFO ON SPECIAL DSP - G1304 ----------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

SDSP cannot be placed on GG; you can change into them only when a girl has
been in every DSP on her GG. Let's say you have Protection Halo GG equipped
for Yuna with gunner, warrior, thief, black mage, and white mage on it, and
she starts off as gunner in battle. In order to change into Floral Fallal,
she must change into warrior, thief, black mage, and white mage DSP. After
that, bring up the GG and press R1 for her SDSP. When you use SDSP, the other
two girls disappear. You lose Rikku & Paine, and now you have a party of Yuna
along with two other 'parts'. SDSP are not given to you in the beginning of
the game; you must find them before you can use them.

Note: You can easily see what path you took on specific GG by distinguishing
the connecting lines - ones you've already taken are displayed in blue.

There is a small SDSP trick involved. The more nodes GG you're using has, the
higher the main unit's HP, MP, Strength, Magic, Defense, and Magic Defense
will be after the girl transfors into SDSP. Note that only *main* unit is
affected.


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
------------------- E - MASTERING DSP? - G1305 - ALPHA1002 ------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

DSP is mastered once you learn all of the abilities particular DSP has to
offer. You'll know so when 'MASTER' sign appears next to DSP name once you
examine Ability heading in main menu.

Three DSP have special requirements that must be met before being mastered.
SONGSTRESS DSP - Max amount of abilities you can learn the hard way is 14.
                 For remaining two you must find two key items that allow
                 Songstress to learn two special dances.
GUN MAGE DSP   - Max amount of abilities you can learn the hard way is 16.
                 Then you prolly still wonder why the heck you have 84%
                 completion there? Access command Blue Bullet when in battle
                 and you'll see it's empty. That's cos you haven't learned
                 any of blue magic yet. For each of 16 blue magics you learn,
                 1% is added to mastering gun mage. Once you have them all,
                 this DSP is mastered.
SPECIAL DSP    - Max amount of abilities you can learn for all three parts
                 the hard way is 14. Like with songstress, here you'll be
                 missing two as well. And again you must find two key items
                 that allow SDSP to have BDL and BHL. Take note, you must
                 find two key items for Rikku, two for Yuna, two for Paine!

                 consider this stat to be stat con
                 - Amount of '!' signs following the stat denotes how
                 seriously should you consider upping that particular stat -
                 more '!' there are, higher the importance of upping it
                 - If no '!' is following a certain stat, that means that
                 stat in question is close to pro value

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

No, this isn't a poll on which girl looks the hottest in certain job (my
votes go to Rikku as Lady Luck and Yuna as Floral Fallal), but more an
overlook into different DSP and to give you my opinion on how useful these
DSP may be. Let's begin the dance (can't choose between Rikku or Yuna)!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gunner - G1308          | Available to? - Yuna, Rikku, Paine
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview?  - As this is Yuna's job she begins with, it's pretty basic in many
             aspects. I wouldn't recommend relying too heavily on it, as it
             isn't that hot and useful IMO - gunner's abilities aren't up to
             par, and Darkproof & Sleepproof PASA also don't cut it. There's
             one occassion where this job shines - if you have Cat Nip acc,
             equip it and select Trigger Happy command when girl is in
             critical condition for a bunch of 9999 shots.
Stat pros  - STR, AGL, ACCU
Stat cons  - HP, MP!, DEF!!, MAG!, MDEF!!, EVA!!!, LUCK!
Obtain how?- Yuna starts with this DSP.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Warrior - G1309         | Available to? - Yuna, Rikku, Paine
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview?  - Really useful class for beginning stages of the game. Packs all
             six types of elemental attacks, has break skills and can delay
             enemy's actions as well, this job will serve you well. Is there
             a particular enemy or enemy party you don't wish to be bothered
             with? Cast Assault and they'll go down the crapper faster than
             you can say... erm, whatever. Later on, this job's usefulness is
             outmatched by dark knight.
Stat pros  - HP, STR, DEF, AGL
Stat cons  - MP!, MAG!!, MDEF!!!, ACCU, EVA!!!, LUCK!!!
Obtain how?- Paine starts with this DSP.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thief - G1310           | Available to? - Yuna, Rikku, Paine
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview?  - One of the ways to get ahold of really rare and useful items is
             thru thief's abilities. But not only that, thief can also steal
             enemy's HP and MP, as well as cash - she may even force the
             enemy to escape from battle. Thief is the only job that attacks
             twice for each PATK you select to use, plus she excels in AGL
             and barrage of attacks she can use really often.
Stat pros  - HP, STR, AGL, LUCK
Stat cons  - MP!, DEF!!, MAG!, MDEF!!, ACCU, EVA!
Obtain how?- Rikku starts with this DSP.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Songstress - G1311      | Available to? - Yuna, Rikku, Paine
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview?  - After some more playing I've come to realize just how useful
             this job can be. Keeping enemies asleep for as long as she
             dances, and physical attacks won't wake them up! Being
             invulnerable to any magic attack (kicks Black Elemental in the
             nuts)! However, pain is great - low HP and extraordinarily low
             defensive stats makes her fall easily to just about everything.
             Plus effects of dances and songs aren't all that useful - this
             can be corrected by equipping her with Adamantite and Shmooth
             Shailing for super long dance effects (Shailing tip submitted by
             NGEVA).
Stat pros  - MP, MAG, AGL
Stat cons  - HP!, STR (can't attack), DEF!!!, MDEF!!, ACCU (can't attack),
             EVA!!!, LUCK!!!
Obtain how?- Gained as battle spoils from main boss of Storyline Mission 1

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
White Mage - G1312      | Available to? - Yuna, Rikku, Paine
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview?  - Yay, one of my favorite jobs. Comes fully equipped with healing
             magic, revival magic, Esuna, Protect, Shell and always evil
             Reflect - all of these are useful abilities for just about any
             battle in the game. Downside? Low HP, DEF and EVA. You also
             don't get to use Haste/ga, Holy and Auto-Life, for which you
             must fulfill certain requirements - even so never underestimate
             white mage. She can save your rear more than once, if you play
             her wisely.
Stat pros  - MP, MAG, MDEF, AGL
Stat cons  - HP!!, STR (can't attack), DEF!!!, ACCU (can't attack), EVA!!!,
             LUCK!!!
Obtain how?- CH1 - defeat Flame Dragon boss in storyline mission 3 in Besaid

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Black Mage - G1313      | Available to? - Yuna, Rikku, Paine
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview?  - Black mage is another job I find very disappointing. Besides
             some crappy abilities all magics she has to offer are of
             elemental type. Where's Flare, Ultima, Demi and the rest of
             crusade? You have to work for those, nyah nyah *shakes fist*.
Stat pros  - MP, MAG, MDEF, AGL
Stat cons  - HP!!, STR (can't attack), DEF!!!, ACCU (can't attack), EVA!!!,
             LUCK!!!
Obtain how?- CH1 - after defeating Boris, consult with Shinra aboard Celsius

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gun Mage - G1314        | Available to? - Yuna, Rikku, Paine
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview?  - Or blue mage, if you prefer. What she does is: get hit by one of
             enemy's special attacks and if you're lucky, gun mage will learn
             it for later use. Yay! Blue magic has IMO always been the most
             useful of all magic classes. White Wind finally after long pause
             removes NEGSE as well! Mighty Guard still bites tho'. There's
             still more she's good at: her shot techs can deal quadruple
             damage to most enemy species and she has Scan, with which you
             can view your enemy's stats, strengths and weaknesses. BTW, do
             you also find it *extremely* naughty that only 3rd level of Scan
             allows you to scan your own girls?
Stat pros  - MP, STR, MAG, AGL, ACCU
Stat cons  - HP!, DEF!!, MDEF!, EVA!!!, LUCK!!!
Obtain how?- CH1 - attempt 'Shave the Hypello' mission in Moonflow, you can
             lose all luggage, simply make it to the river
             CH2 - attempt 'YRP, the scalpers three' mission in Moonflow, and
             sell more than six tickets with profit (or breaking even) to
             ensure getting it

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alchemist - G1315       | Available to? - Yuna, Rikku, Paine
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview?  - Alchemists rule! Her ability to produce items outta the blue
             without decreasing your item stock is priceless (sniff, no
             Megalixir this way). Once you get all of her abilities, effects
             of almost all items are doubled. Couple that with Mix command
             and you got yourself a job you won't wish to part with - Mix
             allows for all kinds of weird situations, all of which are
             described in my separate 'Mix List' guide, also available at
             GameFAQs.
Stat pros  - STR, AGL, ACCU
Stat cons  - HP!, MP!!, DEF!!!, MAG!!, MDEF!!!, EVA!!!, LUCK!!!
Obtain how?- CH2 - meet Clasko in CH1 during 'Foggy Fiend Frenzy' mission in
             Mushroom; after completing it, return to SSP found at the
             entrance to 'Mushroom rock' screen - he'll be located on the
             right; talk to him and say [The more, the merrier!]; then
             participate in 'Cuckoo for Chocobos' mission on Mi'ihen in CH2
             and Clasko will help you; after wasting the boss enter 'M -
             agency, f' screen and invite both Clasko and Calli onboard
             (Calli will come onboard only if you were able to get a chocobo
             for her); finally go to Calm lands, enter the 'Facility ruins'
             and complete 'Clean Sweep' mission
             CH3, CH5 - if you did not participate in 'Foggy Fiend Frenzy'
             mission or didn't invite Clasko on Celsius, then find him in CH2
             on 'Mushroom rock' screen just before you enter 'M - ravine
             path' - he'll run off to Calm lands and you'll find him there in
             CH3 (or CH5) - complete 'Clean Sweep' mission and ranch is open
             CH3, CH5 - if you invite Clasko onboard, but fail to stop by
             Calm lands in CH2, he'll appear there automatically in CH3 (or
             CH5 - ranch is open after 'Clean sweep' is taken care of

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lady Luck - G1316       | Available to? - Yuna, Rikku, Paine
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview?  - Can I write in big fat letters? SEXY!!! Not only that, her
             abilities with slots allow you to cast Ultima for free, heal
             your girls for free and much much more. Slot possibilities are
             almost endless. Lady Luck is the master of chaining - get her to
             throw four sixes and watch that chain count up. She also has
             Bribe ability, granting you an opportunity to bribe the enemies
             and hopefully get sth in return. When mastered fully, Lady Luck
             offers double EXP, gil and items when battle is won. Don't you
             just love being lucky? But beware - mess up on slots one time
             too many and it may be game over for you... you'll know what I
             mean when you experience it. This makes her double-edged sword.
             If you're in possession of Cat Nip, combine it with Four Dice
             and you may get in 24 hits for 9999 damage, even higher than
             famous Trigger Happy.
Stat pros  - MP, STR, AGL, ACCU, LUCK
Stat cons  - HP!, DEF!!!, MAG, MDEF!!, EVA!!!
Obtain how?- CH3 - win three games of Sphere Break in Luca so that you're
             able to enter the finals against Shinra; outplay Shinra to
             obtain this DSP; I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU GET IT NOW!
             CH5 - if you lose or didn't participate in Sphere Break in CH3,
             you can try playing Shinra in Luca - he can be found in
             'Basement A' screen for second chance of obtaining this DSP, but
             beware, this time he's much tougher!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Berserker - G1317       | Available to? - Yuna, Rikku, Paine
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview?  - One of more powerful classes, this one relies solely on raw
             power of PATK and ability to counter almost anything. Whether or
             not you wish to have her berserked is your choice - once she has
             Auto-Regen PASA, she's almost unstoppable if you couple that
             with Magic Counter and Evade&Counter PASA. Berserker is very
             vulnerable to most status changes, so if you get one and girl is
             berserked cos of you commanding so, you may be screwed...
Stat pros  - HP, STR, AGL
Stat cons  - MP!!, DEF!!!, MAG!!!, MDEF!!!, ACCU, EVA!!, LUCK!!
Obtain how?- CH3 - complete 'Protect the Agency' mission in Macalania

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dark Knight - G1318     | Available to? - Yuna, Rikku, Paine
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview?  - Yesss, another powerhouse. ACTA suck (who needs status magic
             anyway?), but many PASA she can obtain make up for it. I love
             Darkness MCWc - at expense of some user's HP it hits every enemy
             on the field 100% and ignores special defenses. Never use
             Charon ACTA... having one girl less to be able to battle is too
             high of a price to be paid for massive damage.
Stat pros  - HP, MP, STR, DEF
Stat cons  - MAG, MDEF, AGL, ACCU, EVA!!!, LUCK!!!
Obtain how?- CH2 - get in in 'Bevelle - labyrinth 2' screen - ahead you see
             three lifts; use left one first - on upper level climb both
             elevations to get access to final lift up here; now go S all the
             way until you fall down - use N lift now to be transported to
             elevated switch - climb onto it and two pillars will rise
             somewhere; go back down, and now ride right lift to upper level;
             take left lift back down to lower level - use N lift again and
             you get access to another elevated switch - climb onto it and
             you have now complete access to this DSP; use the lift to ride
             back down, then use left lift to go back up to upper level -
             finally use top lift here to get even higher; up here use the
             pillars you've been rising to collect this DSP
             CH3 - if you sided with New Yevon, you have the ability of
             entering Bevelle dungeon thru whole chapter; if you sided with
             Youth League, there's only one chance - AFTER completing both
             Kilika and Besaid HS, but BEFORE attempting Djose HS; follow
             instructions a bit above
             CH5 - same as for CH2

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Samurai - G1319         | Available to? - Yuna, Rikku, Paine
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview?  - Go, samurai! Spare Change, now! I love using cash for dealing
             damage to enemies. And in FFX-2, max damage when throwing gil
             has been upped to 99999! That and many other useful abilities
             (too bad they only work on user and you can't target other two
             girls) may prompt you to use samurai job often. Insta-kill move
             for all enemies is absolutely the king. And Zantetsu can kill
             *anything* in the game - this includes Trema, if you're lucky.
Stat pros  - HP, STR, AGL
Stat cons  - MP, DEF!!!, MAG, MDEF!!, ACCU, EVA!!!, LUCK!!
Obtain how?- CH3 - when attempting storyline mission 10 in Kilika temple,
             kill two Daevas in fixed battle, then look carefully at the
             floor for circular shape - pick it up
             CH5 - if you did not collect it in CH3, you can find this DSP
             inside one of the chests in Kilika temple

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trainer - G1320         | Available to? - Yuna, Rikku, Paine*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview?  - Trainer is a fun job, but I don't find myself using it very
             often, for I think other jobs may do same thing better. Yuna's
             abilities are meant more for dealing element type damage, while
             Rikku's specialize more in giving enemies headaches with various
             statuses. Paine's is half enemy-annoyance-attacks, half helping
             the party with protect, shell and haste. All three classes
             possess abilities to heal whole party at once.
Stat pros  - HP, STR, AGL
Stat cons  - MP, DEF!!, MAG!!, MDEF!!!, ACCU, EVA!!!, LUCK!!!
Obtain how?- CH3 - meet Kimahri in CH2, talk to him twice and pick middle
             option; meet Kimahri in CH3 and this DSP is yours
* note     - Each girl uses different animal and has different set of
             abilities she can choose from.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mascot - G1321          | Available to? - Yuna, Rikku, Paine*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview?  - Most powerful job IMO. In addition to primary set of abilities
             each of two girls has access to two more set of abilities for
             other jobs...
             Yuna  - as mascot she specializes in aiding, healing and
                     reviving, but to wipe that smirk off your face, she also
                     has access to abilities of warrior and dark knight
             Rikku - as mascot she loves to deal element damage and annoy
                     enemies with status changes, and she also has access to
                     abilities of berserker and white mage
             Paine - damage and status changes on enemies as a mascot, and
                     access to samurai and black mage abilities
             All of this mayhem will easily convince you that mascot is the
             definitive DSP. In addition mascot can learn Ribbon PASA.
Stat pros  - HP, MP, STR, DEF, MAG, MDEF, AGL, ACCU
Stat cons  - EVA!!!, LUCK!!
Obtain how?- CH5 - get Episode Complete! in all 15 areas of Spira**
* note     - Each girl uses different outfit and has different set of
             abilities she can choose from.
** note    - follow this guide for directions on getting mascot

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Floral Fallal - G1322   | Available to? - Yuna
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview?  - When a tough enemy just won't go down, and you're on brink of
             extinction - bring in fallen angel! Yuna's sexyness will easily
             avert enemy's attention and help you kill them more easily...
             just kidding, there's more to do than look at the body. Floral
             Fallal offers a wide variety of abilities: ranging from element
             attacks over healing to status annoyance. Combine that with
             Ribbon, BHL, BDL, Double HP and Triple HP and you have a
             definitive killermachine, even stronger than fabled mascot.
MAIN PART    Stat pros - HP, MP, STR, MAG, MDEF
             Stat cons - DEF!, AGL, ACCU, EVA!!!, LUCK!!!
LEFT PART    Stat pros - HP, MP, STR, MAG

RIGHT PART   Stat pros - HP, MP, STR, MAG
             Stat cons - DEF!!, MDEF, AGL, ACCU, EVA!!!, LUCK!!!
Obtain how?- CH2 - find on Djose highroad when looking for Syndicate uniforms

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Machina Maw - G1323     | Available to? - Rikku
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview?  - When a tough enemy just won't go down, summon a machina and
             watch that hapless enemy be trampled into oblivion. Like Floral
             Fallal, Machina Maw is also a force to be reckoned with: it
             offers attacks that inflict status changes, skills that aid
             girl's status (or machina's in this particular example), as well
             as good ol' fashioned PATK. Combine that with Ribbon, BHL, BDL,
             Double HP and Triple HP and you have a definitive killermachine,
             and I do mean literally.
MAIN PART    Stat pros - HP, MP, STR, DEF, MAG, ACCU
             Stat cons - MDEF!!, AGL, EVA!!!, LUCK!!!
LEFT PART    Stat pros - HP, MP, STR, MAG, ACCU

RIGHT PART   Stat pros - HP, MP, STR, MAG, ACCU

Obtain how?- CH2 - find in Bikanel Oasis when looking for Syndicate uniforms

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Full Throttle - G1324   | Available to? - Paine
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview?  - Final DSP and weirdest of them all IMO. Just what the heck is
             this thing? Those things aside, I'm more interested on what's
             inside of... I mean, which abilities are at your disposal -
             after taking a closer look, nothing really stands out. You have
             usual element based attacks, then attacks that induce status
             changes as well as healing abilities. Ribbon, BHL, BDL, Double
             HP and Triple HP mustn't be forgotten as well.
MAIN PART    Stat pros - HP, STR, DEF, MAG, AGL, ACCU
             Stat cons - MP!!, MDEF, EVA!!!, LUCK!!
LEFT PART    Stat pros - HP, MP, STR, MAG, ACCU

RIGHT PART   Stat pros - HP, MP, STR, MAG, ACCU
             Stat cons - DEF, MDEF!!, AGL, EVA!!!, LUCK!!!
Obtain how?- CH1 - visit 'Macalania Spring' and find Tromell here - talk to
             him four times and he spits out this SDSP
             CH2 - you must complete musicians subquest first - it doesn't
             matter if you beam to Celsius - return to 'MW - spring 1' and
             Tromell can be found there again, so talk to him four times and
             this SDSP is yours

---------------------- A - BASICS OF ABILITIES - G14001 ---------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Abilities have and always will be one of my favorite parts of guides. To make
short story even shorter, abilities are one of most important aspects of this
game. Do not confuse them with auto-abilities of acc! Auto-abilities are
discussed in section 16.

Abilities come on each and every of 17 DSP you can obtain. Single DSP allows
you to learn a maximum of 16 abilities that are tied to that particular DSP.
Once all 16 abilities of DSP are learned, DSP gains 'MASTER' sign - this
means that DSP is mastered and nothing else can be learned. Three exceptions
apply - press CTRL + F and type in this phrase, without the asterisks:
*ALPHA1002*.

What do abilities do? Well, they help you in various ways, either by nailing
enemies with powerful attacks, healing/aiding your girls (casting Curaga to
heal them or casting Protect to make them halve phd they take) or plain ol'
escaping from battle. There's over 400 abilities to choose from and all of
them will be covered here.

---------------------- B - LEARNING ABILITIES? - G14002 ---------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

In order to learn abilities for particular DSP, you must equip that DSP and
do battle. Each action taken while girl is in DSP awards some AP to ability
being learned. By 'each action' I mean - you either use Item command, or one
of already learned abilities for that DSP. Note that killed enemies award AP
to all girls, not just the one who killed it.

Different abilities require different amount/s of AP before they're learned -
please note that some DSP are already learned when you gain possession of new
DSP (like for example Attack). Basic abilities require less, while some of
most powerful require insane amount of AP before you can use them (999 AP for
Ribbon, for example).

Besides the case in which you need to find certain key item before ability is
enabled for learning (described just a little bit above) or being hit by
specific enemy attacks in case of gun mage, most abilities will require you
to learn 'prerequisite abilities'. I'll give you few examples of what I mean.

Trigger Happy Lv3 - will only appear after Trigger Happy Lv2 is learned
Blizzaga          - will only appear after Blizzara is learned
Delay Buster      - will only appear after Delay Attack is learned

---------------------- C - ABILITY 'CLASSES'? - G14003 ----------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

To sort abilities in their proper 'class' (this has nothing to do with jobs),
I'll sort them under three main categories.

1. 'Main Command Window' command (MCW command)
These will be abilities that enable girl to have a new command available in
MCW, whenever girl is doing battle. A clear example is 'Attack' command of
warrior.

2. Active type ability (ACTA)
These will be abilities that girl can actively choose from whenever she's
doing battle - ACTA help the girls to change the flow of battle in their
favor or simply to have fun (for me it's more of the latter, hehe). I know
this sounds complicated... how can I put this simply? Let's say that girl
chooses one of MCW commands she has at her disposal, for example 'White
Magic'. A sublist will appear, containing all white magics girl has learned
so far - in other words, active type abilities.

3. Passive type ability (PASA)
These are all abilities that work passively and are always in effect, as soon
as appropriate DSP is worn. In other words, there's no way for girls to
choose which PASA they would like to use, simply cos they're already in
effect. Examples, you say? Slowproof PASA of thief, Deathproof PASA of dark
knight and Ribbon PASA of mascot are some examples.


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
--------------------------- D - MP ISSUE - G14004 ---------------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Many ACTA require girls to have sufficient MP at disposal. If you'd like to
have Yuna cast Fire, she must have at least 4 MP left. If MP is 3 or less,
Fire cannot be cast. In addition to that, Fire ACTA will also be greyed out
and you'll get a warning sound whenever you press X on it.

In short, all ACTA that can be used with whatever MP amount you currently
have, will be displayed in white. If you don't have sufficient amount of MP
to cast/use certain/all ACTA, then such ACTA will be greyed out.

PASA do not require MP in order to be used - they're always in effect, as
soon as appropriate DSP is worn, remember?


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
----------------- E - HOW WILL I PRESENT THE INFO? - G14005 -----------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

As mentioned, there's 17 DSP in total. Taking into account that mascot and
trainer have different ability sets for each girl, and that each SDSP
consists of three parts, total amount of listed ability sets will be 27.

An entry for say warrior will be made, followed by a detailed list of all
abilities this job can learn. In that list you will be able to find what is
important to know, ie how much AP is needed before ability is learned, how
much MP (if any) needs to be consumed at time of execution etc.

There will be six extra entries listed, for which I will arrange the
presentation a little differently:
- gun mage's Blue Bullet abilities
- lady luck's Attack Reels abilities
- lady luck's Magic Reels abilities
- lady luck's Item Reels abilities
- lady luck's Random Reels abilities
- alchemist's Mix abilities

----------------- F - CHART EXAMPLE AND EXPLANATION - G14006 ----------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Use this section as a reference when you don't know or forget how to read my
chart. There will be a lot to cover, so let's begin.

Example:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Ability name            | 2. MP?  | 3. TRG?       | 4. Type?    | 5. AP?
6. What it does?
7. Prerequisites?
8. Add. info?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation:

1. Ability name  : name of the ability in question

2. MP?           : how much MP is needed to execute ability in question; in
                   here one of two numbers will appear...
                   'na' - means that ability in question doesn't require MP
                          in order to be cast/used
                   '50' - means that ability in question requires certain
                          amount of MP before it is cast/used; amount of MP
                          needed ranges from 2 to 99

3. TRG? (target) : many of the abilities can be used only on enemies, on
                   girls or both - this part will tell you that piece of
                   information; here are 'marks' I'll be using...
                   '1 G'     - denotes that ability in question can only be
                               used on one of three girls
                   '1 E'     - denotes that ability in question can only be
                               used on one of the enemies
                   '1 ANY'   - denotes that ability in question can be used
                               either on one of three girls or one of the
                               enemies
                   'SELF'    - denotes that ability in question can only be
                               used on user (ie self), or ability is question
                               is of PASA type
                   'ALL G'   - denotes that ability in question can only be
                               used on your own party
                   'ALL E'   - denotes that ability in question can only be
                               used on enemy party
                   'ANY GRP' - denotes that ability in question can be used
                               either on your own party or enemy party
                   'none'    - denotes that ability in question doesn't
                               target anything, instead it leads to a submenu
                               with more choices (for example Gunplay ability
                               of gunner)
                   '1 / ALL' - denotes that ability in question can affect
                               either: 1 girl, all girls, 1 enemy, all
                               enemies

4. Type?         : will tell you if ability in question is ACTA, PASA or MCW
                   command type
                   'ACTA' - ability in question is active type command
                   'PASA' - ability in question is passive type command
                   'MCWc' - ability in question adds new command to MCW

5. AP?           : how much AP do you need to accrue before ability in
                   question is learned; in here one of two numbers will
                   appear...
                   'na' - means that ability in question is already learned
                   '50' - means that ability in question needs to accumulate
                          50 AP before it is learned; amount of AP needed
                          ranges from 10 to 999

6. What it does? : detailed explanation of what exactly does ability in
                   question do, followed by damage formulas for some of
                   special abilities (if I'll be able to figure it out)
                   'NON-E' - denotes that mgd is of non-elemental type
                   'light' - denotes that damage is of lightning type (be it
                             physical or magical)
                   Be advised that if attack carries some POSSE or NEGSE and
                   if target is resistant to those status changes, status
                   change may not occur or will fail.

7. Prerequisites?: some abilities require other abilities to be learned first
                   or you must find correspondig item first - use this part
                   to find out what's needed before ability can be learned

8. Add. info?    : This will cover the rest of info I can't fit anywhere
                   else, these being...
                     <R>  - if ability is white magic or black magic, this
                            sign denotes that such ability can be reflected
                            back to the caster (some magics can't be
                            reflected!)
                     <S>  - if ability is of magical nature, this sign
                            denotes that such ability's effects can be
                            lessened by 50% if target is under shell POSSE
                     <P>  - if ability is of physical nature, this sign
                            denotes that such ability's effects can be
                            lessened by 50% if target is under protect POSSE
                     <M+> - if ability is of magical nature, this sign
                            denotes that such ability's effects can be
                            increased by raising user's MAG stat or inducing
                            MDEF down NEGSE on target
                     <S+> - if ability is of physical nature, this sign
                            denotes that such ability's effects can be
                            increased by raising user's STR stat or inducing
                            DEF down NEGSE on target
                     <E>  - if ability is of elemental nature, this sign
                            denotes that such ability's effects will be
                            affected by target's element affinities, ie
                            effects can be halved (target is strong VS that
                            element), nulled (target is immune against that
                            element), absorbed (target absorbs that element),
                            or they will do critical damage (target is weak
                            against that element)
                     <CT> - if ability in question requires charging before
                            it can be used, this mark will denote that fact
                     <RT> - ability in question is executed immediately, but
                            then requires the girl to enter recovery phase
                            before her next turn is up; this mark will denote
                            that fact
                   <2xRT> - same as <RT> class abilities, only difference is
                            that after ability is executed, recovery time
                            before girl's next turn is twice as long
                   <CRIT> - ability in question can do double (critical)
                            damage
                   If there are no marks found by specific ability, it means
                   that such effect doesn't exist for that ability. For
                   example, it's useless and silly to make <S+> mark by
                   Firaga ability.

Here's the Bribe formula, contributed by DiabolicAngel 

([Gil Used] x 256 / [fiend's Max HP] x 5 ) - 64 = Bribe #
success ratio = Bribe # / 256

e.g.:
Gil Used: 15,000
Fiend Max HP: 3324

(15,000 x 256 / 3324 x 5 ) - 64
Bribe #= 167
success ratio = 167 / 256

Few notes you must know:
- to get BB skill, your girl must be in gun mage DSP, *must* be hit with BB
skill in question, and it *must* be the enemy using the skill on you
- you will *not* learn the skill if the above requirements aren't met
- it doesn't matter if girl is KO-ed when BB skill is used, it is enough that
your girl is hit with it
- to get White Wind and Mighty Guard to be used on your girls, you must
*confuse* the enemy; eventually the enemy will use the skill on you

CONGRATS! - G14523                                            | TRG - ALL E
What it does?  - enemies hand over items (as if they were bribed) and leave
                 the battle, girls win extra gil*, girls also gain EXP and
                 cash enemies would've 'dropped' if defeated
                 * note - highest fiend's LV x640 (or up to x1275) = gil
Add. info?     - CT, doesn't work on enemies immune to bribing

- Here's the indepth CONGRATS! gil formula contributed by DiabolicAngel:

[Monster Lvl] x 5 x [Random # 128 - 256]

- And here's the indepth CONGRATS! item gain formula sent by DiabolicAngel:

([Item #*] x (Sq.Root of [Bribe #*]) x [Rdm Nr 20-30] / 400) + [Rdm Nr 0 - 1]

* Bribe # for Congrats! is ALWAYS 128
* Random numbers are always whole numbers
* Round down for decimals at end
* Item gain minimum is 1 - round to 1 if # smaller than 1
* Item gain cannot exceed 99

e.g.:
item # = 6
Bribe # = 256

(6 x Square Root of 256 x [Random Number 20-30] / 400) + [Random Number 0-1]
= (6 x 16 x [Random Number 20 -30] / 400) + [Random Number 0-1]
= (1920 ~ 2880) / 400 + [Random Number 0-1]
= (4~ 7) + [Random Number 0-1]
= (4~ 8) Items gained

--------------------------- A - OVERVIEW - G15129 ---------------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

1. Accessories (acc for short) are, besides GG and DSP, only pieces of
   equipment you'll lay your hands on. There's a grand total of 128 different
   acc you can find in whole game.

2. Taking into aspect rarity (ie how often you can obtain acc) acc can be
   classified in three different categories. These are:
   - COMMON ACC:   These are acc you'll find the most of. You'll recognize
                   them straight away by bronze colored wrist, preceeding
                   acc's name.
   - UNCOMMON ACC: These acc are bit rarer than common, but still not that
                   rare. You'll recognize them straight away by silver
                   colored wrist, preceeding acc's name.
   - RARE ACC:     These acc are rarest of them all. They cannot be obtained
                   so easily and you must often work hard to achieve them.
                   You'll recognize them straight away by gold colored wrist,
                   preceeding acc's name.

3. All acc grant special effects when equipped on girls. Effects range from
   boosting certain stats over granting new abilities to bestowing various
   other effects. Do take care - not all special effects are beneficial,
   sometimes you will be penalized for having acc equipped.

4. Taking into aspect special effects acc grants when equipped acc can be
   classified in five different categories. These are:
   - STATISTIC ACC: These type of acc boost one or more of girl's stats when
                    equipped. All acc that fall in this category bestow
                    beneficial effects when equipped.
   - ELEMENTAL ACC: These type of acc boost both one or more of girl's stats
                    as well as grant element properties (either to girl's
                    PATK or girl's element affinities) when equipped. All acc
                    that fall in this category bestow beneficial effects when
                    equipped.
   - STATUS ACC:    There's many different effects that come into play.
                    You'll learn about them in respective section, so no
                    fret. Beware! Some acc that fall in this category will
                    penalize you for having them equipped.
   - ABILITY ACC:   These type of acc boost one or more of girl's stats when
                    equipped and at same time grant the ability for girl to
                    perform actions which are otherwise not available to her.
                    All acc that fall in this category bestow beneficial
                    effects when equipped.
   - SPECIAL ACC:   There's many different effects that come into mind.
                    You'll learn about them in respective section, so no
                    fret. Beware! Some acc that fall in this category will
                    penalize you for having them equipped.

5. Acc can be obtained in variety of ways - you can steal them from enemies,
   receive them as battle spoils, bribe enemies to hand them over, find them
   in treasure chests, receive them as gifts from people, buy them in one of
   many shops or receive them as prizes in many minigames.

6. Finally, you can equip up to two acc to a single girl. There's no way in
   hell to equip more than two acc. Two is the max you can gave equipped.
   When in doubt, reread this point again.

7. Take note that first time around I've taken names of acc as translated on
   Seph's unofficial translation site (link is in credits section), so he
   gets kudos for making this section possible. Now that US version is within
   my grasp, I've made necessary changes.

------------------------ B - CHART OVERVIEW - G15130 ------------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

- Sample acc chart which will apply to most accessories:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Acc's name                | 2. Stat effects?  | 3. Sell/Buy?   | 4. Rarity
5. Auto-abilities?
6. Obtained?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Explanation of the chart sections:
1. Listed here be name of acc you're wondering about.
2. If acc in question is equipped, what are effects of it being equipped?
   Stat followed by '+' sign means that relevant stat is increased, stat
   followed by '-' sign means that relevant stat is decreased. Stats are
   raised either by a predermined amount, or by a certain percentage (such
   stat increases will be followed by '%' sign).
3. Sell cost and buying price of acc in question.
4. Rarity of acc in question, which will be represented by one of three
   letters: 'C' for common, 'U' for uncommon and 'R' for rare.
5. Sometimes AAB is/are present on acc - names of those AAB will be here.
6. Here I will typical whereabouts of acc locations.

--------------------- C - STATISTIC ACCESSORIES - G15131 --------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Note: None of these acc have AAB on them, therefore that part of chart isn't
needed. Same applies for 'Add. info' part of chart - it isn't needed cos
there's nothing special to be told.

--------------------- A - WHAT IS GARMENT GRID? - G1601 ---------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Garment Grid (GG for short) is an essential piece of equipment for each of the
three girls, for it allows them to be granted with special effects (not all GG
grant benefits!). I think that GG can best be described as a piece of armor,
if you wish. Each girl must be equipped with one of many GG you will come
across in the game.

Just equipping GG on girls won't do much good - you must also insert at least
one of already obtained DSP in one of the nodes present of GG. Unless at least
one DSP is inserted, you cannot leave GG menu (for more explanation on GG menu
refer to section 8). In other words - EACH GIRL MUST BE EQUIPPED WITH GG THAT
HAS AT LEAST ONE DSP INSERTED INTO THAT PARTICULAR GG. Only then will you be
let out of the GG menu.


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
------------ B - UNDERSTANDING GARMENT GRID MENU SCREEN? - G1602 ------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I will describe how to read GG menu screen very quickly.

1. Help line on the top is always there.

2. On the left a list of all GG you obtained so far is displayed. Move thru
   the list with up/down, or press L2/R2 to scroll thru the list.

3. Right half of the screen shows how does particular GG look like.

4. Below information about particular GG is displayed - this info tells you
   what are the effects of GG when it is equipped and what benefits do girls
   gain if during Spherechange Up they pass thru one of the gates.


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
----------- C - SPECIAL EFFECTS OF EQUIPPED GARMENT GRID? - G1603 -----------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Special effects gained when equipping particular GG range greatly. They can be
classified in three categories (abbreviations found below will help you
quickly determine what type of effect is being granted to you):

1. STAT INCREASE -   When equipping GG which grants this type of special
   (P-STAT+)         effect/s, one or more of girl's stats is permanently
                     increased for as long as GG isn't removed.
                     Examples: DEF+15, MDEF+20, STR+20

2. ACTIVE ABILITY -  When equipping GG which grants this type of special
   (P-ACTA)          effect/s, girl gains permanent access to one or more
                     abilities to be used/cast during battle for as long as
                     GG isn't removed. In other words, you as the player will
                     have the option to choose when, how and why you wish to
                     use/cast the ability you've been granted access to.
                     Examples: Holy, Waterga, Flare, Ultima

3. PASSIVE ABILITY - When equipping GG which grants this type of special
   (P-PASA)          effect/s, girl gains permanent access to one or more
                     auto-abilities which are then in effect for as long as
                     GG isn't removed (effects of auto-abilities may show on
                     field screen or inside of battle. In other words, you as
                     the player will have no control over such abilities -
                     they will always be in effect regardless of your past or
                     future actions.
                     Examples: Break HP Limit, MP Stroll, HP Stroll


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
------------------------- D - WHAT IS A NODE? - G1604 -----------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

You've probably noticed some empty slots on GG, which lie scattered around and
are connected to another slot with a line. These slots are otherwise known as
NODES. Number of nodes on single GG ranges from 2 nodes up to 6 nodes. Sole
purpose of the nodes is to provide a place for your DSP to be put in. Nodes
are present on every GG available in FFX-2.

For more information on how to equip/insert DSP, please refer to section 8.


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
------------------------ E - WHAT IS A GATE? - G1605 ------------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Besides nodes you've also noticed that some GG have colored orbs, which come
in variety of four colors: red, green, blue and yellow. These orbs are called
GATES.

As you already know, two adjacent nodes are connected by a single line - but
sometimes one of the four orbs mentioned above is placed on that connecting
line. If girl enters GG menu during battle by pressing L1, and selects to
transform into DSP adjacent to the DSP she's currently wearing AND passes thru
the gate, this often results in some special effects being granted to the
girl.


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
------- F - SPECIAL EFFECTS AS A RESULT OF PASSING THRU GATES? - G1606 ------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Special effects gained when passing thru the gate range greatly. They can be
classified in three categories (abbreviations found below will help you
quickly determine what type of effect is being granted to you):

1. STAT INCREASE -   When passing thru the gate which grants this type of
   (T-STAT+)         special effect/s, one or more of girl's stats is
                     increased for duration of the battle. Effects can stack.
                     Examples: DEF+15, MDEF+20, STR+20

2. ACTIVE ABILITY -  When passing thru the gate which grants this type of
   (T-ACTA)          special effect/s, girl gains one or more abilities
                     to be used/cast for duration of the battle. In other
                     words, you as the player will have the option to choose
                     when, how and why you wish to use/cast the ability
                     you've been granted access to.
                     Examples: Holy, Waterga, Flare, Ultima

3. PASSIVE ABILITY - When passing thru the gate which grants this type of
   (T-PASA)          special effect/s, girl gains one or more auto-
                     abilities which are then in effect until the end of
                     battle. In other words, you as the player will have no
                     control over such abilities - they will always be in
                     effect regardless of your past or future actions.
                     Examples: Auto-Shell, Confusetouch, Holy Eater
                               Use Swordplay abilities, Use Arcana abilities


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
------- G - ONE GATE - ONE EFFECT? VS MORE GATES - ONE EFFECT? - G1607 ------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

You prolly wonder what does the title of this sub-section mean... Simple. When
you're examining GG in the menu, throw a look at bottom right corner where you
will see information on what special effects are bestowed by passing thru
specific gates. Note how some effects are preceeded by single colored orb,
while other effects may be preceeded by up to four colored orbs? Here's an
example of what does that mean.

For the example I shall use Heart of Flame GG, which has 3 nodes along with
yellow, green and red gates. GG's info in lower right corner says:
- Equip: Fire Eater, Use Fire
- Yellow gate: Firestrike
- Green + Red gate: Use Fira
- Green + Red + Yellow gate: Use Firaga

So, what does this tell you? When in battle and you choose to perform
dresschange with say Yuna, have her change so that she will have to pass thru
yellow gate. When job change is complete, Yuna's PATK will be imbued by
Firestrike, meaning she can deal fire phd to her targets when attacking
physically.

Getting Yuna to be able to cast Fira takes a bit longer, for she must pass
thru BOTH green and red gates before she's able to get access to Fira. The
order of passing thru mentioned gates is not fixed - you can do green first,
then red, or vice versa. It only matters that you pass thru both gates.

Same requirements apply for getting Yuna to be able to cast Firaga. You must
pass thru all three gates on GG before she's granted access to Firaga. Again,
the order of passing thru mentioned gates is not fixed - you can do green
first, then red, and finally yellow, or whichever combo falls onto your mind.
It only matters that you pass thru all gates.

-- H - DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EFFECTS OF EQUIPPED GG / ACTIVATED GATES? - G1608 -
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Although many of special effects granted when GG is equipped are the same as
those that are bestowed when gates are passed and activated, please take into
consideration this important difference.

SPECIAL EFFECTS GRANTED WHEN GG IS EQUIPPED ARE PERMANENT, IE FOR AS LONG AS
GG ISN'T REMOVED FROM THE GIRL. HOWEVER, SPECIAL EFFECTS GRANTED BY ACTIVATED
GATES ARE ONLY TEMPORARY, IE ONCE THE BATTLE IS OVER, ALL BENEFICIAL FACTORS
GAINED THAT WAY ARE LOST.

A simple abbreviation will let you know about nature of special effect.
P-STAT+ - Permanent stat increase
P-ACTA  - Permanent active ability
P-PASA  - Permanent passive ability
T-STAT+ - Temporary stat increase
T-ACTA  - Temporary active ability
T-PASA  - Temporary passive ability

----------- I - CAN ALL THREE GIRLS HAVE SAME GG EQUIPPED? - G1609 ----------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

YRP can all equip the same GG or different ones, or two can have the same GG
and the other a different one. For example, have YRP all equip First Steps,
or have Yuna and Paine equip Protection Halo while Rikku has First Steps, or
have Yuna equip Protection Halo, Rikku First Steps, and Paine Hour of Need.
As long as you have at least one copy of the DSP, you can place it on a GG.
For example, in the last setup with YRP each having a different GG equipped,
you can have gunner DSP on each of them, or just on Paine's if you want. This
is another example of how you can customize your characters. Equip a GG that
gives First Strike to one and have another ready to cast white magic no
matter what the dress, etc.

Here's the example of how a single GG will be presented like:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME?                           | NODES? | RED?   | GREEN? | BLUE?  | YELLOW?
DESCRIPTION?

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
---------------- K - GARMENT GRID CHART EXPLANATION? - G1611 ----------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Is the chart too confusing? Fear not, here's also an explanation:

1. NAME?             : Name of GG in question.

2. DESCRIPTION?      : Short description of GG in question.

3. OBTAIN WHERE?     : How can you claim possession of GG in question?

4. NODES?            : Amount of empty slots on GG in question. There will be
                       a single number here, ranging from 2 to 6.
                       Example: If number entered will be 3, that means that
                                GG has 3 nodes, if number entered will be 6,
                                it means that GG has 6 nodes.

5. GATES?            : Info found here will let you know which gates are
   (red, green, blue   present on GG in question. Single GG may have one,
    and yellow gates)  two, three or four gates integrated (note *). Of
                       course, there are GG which have no gates (note **).
                       *  - R stands for RED gate, G stands for GREEN gate, B
                            stands for BLUE gate and Y is for YELLOW gate.
                       ** - 'y' means that gate in question is integrated
                            into specific GG, while 'n' means that gate is
                            not on GG

6. GG EQUIP EFFECTS? : If GG in question is equipped on the girl, what are
                       the permanent* special effects granted? Find out here.
                       * - special effects are active for as long as GG is
                           equipped; as soon as you remove it, special
                           effects are gone

7. A-GATE/S EFFECTS? : If girl has equipped GG in question and passes thru
                       any gate*/combination of gates** which are integrated
                       onto this GG, what are the temporary*** special
                       effects granted? Find out here.
                       *   - most of the time it is enough for a girl to pass
                             thru single gate in order to gain special
                             effect; in these cases info on what gate must be
                             passed will be presented like this
                             R - must pass thru red gate
                             G - must pass thru green gate
                             B - must pass thru blue gate
                             Y - must pass thru yellow gate
                       **  - in cases where girl has to pass thru combination
                             of the gates before gaining special effect
                             (combo can be made up of passing thru two, three
                             or four gates), then info on which gates must be
                             passed will be presented like this (example):
                             GB - must pass thru green and blue gate
                             RBY - must pass thru red, blue & yellow gates
                             Please note that it isn't necessary for you to
                             pass green first and then blue; you can pass
                             thru blue first and then green - you'd still get
                             special effects in this case
                       *** - special effects are active only until the end of
                             current battle; even if girl is KO-ed, effects
                             aren't gone when she's revived

------------------- A - WHAT ARE AUTO-ABILITIES? - G17001 -------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Exactly as the name tells. AAB are types of abilities that are put into effect
as soon as either of two requirements is met:
- equipping acc or GG
- passing thru colored gate/s on equipped GG


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-------------- B - WHAT ARE PERMANENT AUTO-ABILITIES? - G17002 --------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Permanent AAB are abilities, that are granted and put into effect as soon as
girl equips proper acc/GG. Permanent AAB are classified in three categories:

1. STAT INCREASE -   When equipping acc/GG which grants this type of special
   (P-STA+)          effect/s, one or more of girl's stats is permanently
                     increased for as long as acc/GG isn't removed.
                     Examples: DEF+15, MDEF+20, STR+20

2. ACTIVE ABILITY -  When equipping acc/GG which grants this type of special
   (P-ACTA)          effect/s, girl gains permanent access to one or more
                     abilities to be used/cast during battle for as long as
                     acc/GG isn't removed. In other words, you as the player
                     will have the option to choose when, how and why you
                     wish to use/cast the ability you've been granted access
                     to.
                     Examples: Mug, Nab Gil, Water

3. PASSIVE ABILITY - When equipping acc/GG which grants this type of special
   (P-PASA)          effect/s, girl gains permanent access to one or more
                     auto-abilities which are then in effect for as long as
                     acc/GG isn't removed (effects of auto-abilities may show
                     on field screen or inside of battle. In other words, you
                     as the player will have no control over such abilities -
                     they will always be in effect regardless of your past or
                     future actions.
                     Examples: Break HP Limit, MP Stroll, HP Stroll


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-------------- C - WHAT ARE TEMPORARY AUTO-ABILITIES? - G17003 --------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Temporary AAB are abilities, that are granted and put into effect as soon as
girl passes thru one or more gates on equipped GG. Temporary AAB are
classified in three categories:

1. STAT INCREASE -   When passing thru the gate which grants this type of
   (T-STA+)          special effect/s, one or more of girl's stats is
                     increased for duration of the battle. Effects can stack.
                     Examples: DEF+15, MDEF+20, STR+20

2. ACTIVE ABILITY -  When passing thru the gate which grants this type of
   (T-ACTA)          special effect/s, girl gains one or more abilities
                     to be used/cast for duration of the battle. In other
                     words, you as the player will have the option to choose
                     when, how and why you wish to use/cast the ability
                     you've been granted access to.
                     Examples: Holy, Waterga, Flare, Ultima

3. PASSIVE ABILITY - When passing thru the gate which grants this type of
   (T-PASA)          special effect/s, girl gains one or more auto-
                     abilities which are then in effect until the end of
                     battle. In other words, you as the player will have no
                     control over such abilities - they will always be in
                     effect regardless of your past or future actions.
                     Examples: Auto-Shell, Confusetouch, Holy Eater
                               Use Swordplay abilities, Use Arcana abilities

Note: For info on which gates must be passed to gain access to specific
passive AAB, please refer to section 16.

------- D - SAMPLE CHART OVERVIEW (will apply to all charts)? - G17004 ------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Ability name                      | 2. MP?  | 3. TRG?       | 4. Type?
5. What it does?
6. Add. info?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation:

1. Ability name  : name of the AAB

2. MP?           : how much MP is needed to execute AAB; in here one of two
                   numbers will appear...
                   'na' - means that AAB doesn't require MP in order to be
                          cast/used
                   '50' - means that AAB requires certain amount of MP before
                          it is cast/used; amount of MP needed ranges from 2
                          to 99

3. TRG? (target) : many AAB can be used only on enemies, on girls or both -
                   this part will tell you that piece of info; here are
                   'marks' I'll be using...
                   '1 G'     - AAB can only be used on one of three girls
                   '1 E'     - AAB can only be used on one of the enemies
                   '1 ANY'   - AAB can be used either on one of three girls
                               or one of the enemies
                   'SELF'    - AAB can only be used on user (ie self), or
                               ability is question is of passive type
                   'ALL G'   - AAB can only be used on your own party
                   'ALL E'   - AAB can only be used on enemy party
                   'ANY GRP' - AAB can be used either on your own party or
                               enemy party
                   'none'    - AAB doesn't target anything, instead it leads
                               to a submenu with more choices (for example
                               Swordplay ability of gunner)
                   '1 / ALL' - AAB can affect either: 1 girl, all girls, 1
                               enemy, all enemies

4. Type?*        : to what type does AAB belong?
                   'P-ACTA' - AAB belongs to permanent active type
                   'T-ACTA' - AAB belongs to temporary active type
                   'P-PASA' - AAB belongs to permanent passive type
                   'T-PASA' - AAB belongs to temporary passive type
                   'P-STAT' - AAB belongs to permanent stat increase type
                   'T-STAT' - AAB belongs to temporary stat increase type

* - Some AAB belong to more than one type. For example, girl can cast Firaga
if she equips Crimson Ring - in this case Firaga will be of P-ACTA type. Of
course, she can also get access to casting Firaga by passing thru specific
colored gates on Heart of Flame GG - in this case Firaga will be of T-ACTA
type. Instead of marking down both entries, I'll simply make it like this:
Firaga ... blah blah... Type - 'P/T-ACTA'

5. What it does? : detailed explanation of what exactly does AAB do, followed
                   by damage formulas for some of special AAB (if I'll be
                   able to figure it out)
                   'NON-E' - denotes that mgd is of non-elemental type
                   'light' - denotes that damage is of lightning type (be it
                             physical or magical)
                   Be advised that if attack carries some POSSE or NEGSE and
                   if target is resistant to those status changes, status
                   change may not occur or will fail.

6. Add. info?    : This will cover the rest of info I can't fit anywhere
                   else, these being...
                     <R>  - if AAB is white magic or black magic, this sign
                            denotes that such ability can be reflected back
                            to the caster (some magics can't be reflected!)
                     <S>  - if AAB is of magical nature, this sign denotes
                            that such ability's effects can be lessened by
                            50% if target is under shell POSSE
                     <P>  - if AAB is of physical nature, this sign denotes
                            that such ability's effects can be lessened by
                            50% if target is under protect POSSE
                     <M+> - if AAB is of magical nature, this sign denotes
                            that such ability's effects can be increased by
                            raising user's MAG stat or inducing MDEF down
                            NEGSE on target
                     <S+> - if AAB is of physical nature, this sign denotes
                            that such ability's effects can be increased by
                            raising user's STR stat or inducing DEF down
                            NEGSE on target
                     <E>  - if AAB is of elemental nature, this sign denotes
                            that such ability's effects will be affected by
                            target's element affinities, ie effects can be
                            halved (target is strong VS that element), nulled
                            (target is immune against that element), absorbed
                            (target absorbs that element), or they will do
                            critical damage (target is weak against that
                            element)
                     <CT> - if AAB requires charging before it can be used,
                            this mark will denote that fact
                     <RT> - AAB is executed immediately, but then requires
                            the girl to enter recovery phase before her next
                            turn is up; this mark will denote that fact
                   <2xRT> - same as <RT> class abilities, only difference is
                            that after ability is executed, recovery time
                            before girl's next turn is twice as long
                   <CRIT> - AAB in question can do double (critical) damage
                   If there are no marks found by specific ability, it means
                   that such effect doesn't exist for that ability. For
                   example, it's useless and silly to make <S+> mark by
                   Firaga ability.

=============================================================================
=============================================================================

As you enter the master teleporter, you will appear in a huge room - advance N
for a scene - afterwards pick up CRIMSON SPHERE 6 *KEY ITEM* lying in plain
sight. What you're just uncovered is Bevelle's secret dungeon, long 100
floors! This could be considered longest sidequest in the game. Here are few
notes to be taken into account:

- Charm Bangle acc doesn't work in here (damn)
- there's a boss on 20th, 40th, 60th, 80th and 100th floor
- once the bosses of those floors are defeated, you gain access to the lift
  which can transport you to other boss floors you've cleared so far; this is
  a pretty handy feature in case you wish to fight a particular enemy 10
  floors back, but can't be arsed starting going from scratch
- on every floor there's a blue insignia marked on the floor which when
  examined restores HP&MP to all girls, as well as remove any status ailments
- same insignia also has the power to teleport you out of the dungeon, where
  you can save your game (choose top option to use the teleport, or bottom
  choice to decline)
- after you've been to floors 1 and below and you're about to use the master
  teleporter, you'll be presented with few options: first option will make
  Yuna start from the top floor again, second option allows Yuna to continue
  exploring from same floor she left off, and last option cancels the menu
- each time you enter same floor number anew, the outside appearance of that
  particular floor may change
- your objective on each floor is to find a hole hidden somewhere that leads
  to the floor below (often you will have to kill some enemies or complete a
  simplistic puzzle before the exit is uncovered)
- enemies will get progressively harder, ie the lower dungeon floor you're
  on, harder the opposition you'll be encountering
- you can escape from all random encounters, but you cannot escape from boss
  battles or enemies which you will see wandering around on the floors
- not all of wandering enemies are your enemies - sometimes you will receive
  an item if you address medium sized Tonberry with tiny Tonberry beside it
- also, all Elders and Megas can be avoided - you never need to fight any

With this, let us begin! On same screen where the scene unwinded, press on
further N and you'll find a hole. Jump in it and say hi to 1st floor of this
humongous dungeon. As you make your way deeper in the dungeon and if you
encounter any Borises, flee from them. I know they're easy, but 20th floor
boss is of same species and you wouldn't want it to be oversouled, would you?

Once you're on floor 20, do not advance yet! Instead examine the blue insignia
just behind you and use it. Save your game, then check master teleporter again
and pick middle option. Now advance further...

7. [Dual Catalyst] - on self - the longer the battle, the higher the STR&MAG
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
A replica of earlier bosses, huh? It has an attack pattern as well. Prior to
battle change all your girls into two thieves (make sure they have Stopproof
PASA learned) and white mage. Also equip acc that guard against poison. Or if
you're in love with dark knight - she has Poisonproof PASA, so you'll need acc
that guard against stop. If you can guard against these two statuses, battle
is as good as won. White mage is there only for beginning point of battle,
where she will apply protect and shell, and then change back into either thief
or dark knight.

Attack pattern of boss is: 'double swipe' or 'chew' for four turns, with Gooey
End (500 damage to all) always being used on every 5th turn - latter inflicts
some magic damage in addition to inducing poison and stop. Please note that
damage done by 'chew' (1000 damage to one) cannot be reduced. Count number of
turns boss has used - before each of boss' 5th turn make sure you're not
creepingly low when it comes to HP - heal in time!

Got stopped and poisoned anyway? There's not much you can do until stop wears
off - when you have a chance, heal your girls first, then worry about poison.
You're advised to waste the boss quickly, for each time you see 'burst', your
STR and MAG are reduced by -1 level - difference in damage inflicted shows
greatly, believe me. Throw a look at boss status properties - no eject
immunity tells you what? Fastest way possible to kill the boss! If you feel
lucky, try thief's Steal Will ACTA - it works, but probability of connecting
is low. Strategic briefing over!

OSF Aranea is a funny fiend to toy around with. Battle begins by Aranea using
Dual Catalyst on itself, and then releasing Tempus Laxit. All girls will
suffer phd and be put under stop status. Have Dragonfly Orbs or Kinesis Badges
to be immune (thief DSP helps too). If girls are affected, nothing you can do
about it - just wait fot stop to wear off. Don't take too long in nailing
Aranea or both its STR and MAG (thanks to Power Catalyst) will grow at steady
rate. It's 'chew' attack inflicts huge damage, which cannot be reduced, but
applying protect to reduce 'double swipe' damage is a good idea. Aranea also
has access to lv3 element magic, which can be bounced byck by applying reflect
(don't worry, it won't get dispeled, as Aranea is too stupid to have been
granted Dispel). For the end Aranea also has an ability with which it'll
reduce your gil stock by 10000 gil - wave those smooshing gil sayonara. No big
deal, though - if lady luck is with you, CONGRATS! Aranea out of your way and
you'll gain back more gil you spent.
*****************************************************************************

After the battle go few steps back and recover CRIMSON SPHERE 8 *KEY ITEM*.
This is the last Crimson Sphere of the game and you should now be in
possession of 10 Crimson Spheres, meaning you have access to another optional
dungeon! You may wish to consider saving - after you've done so, continue your
descent to 40th floor (don't forget to go save by examining blue teleporter
behind you!), where...

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
Hah, this guy is so easy it could cry. Of course, if you use one of these
cheesy ways to defeat it.
- gunner + Tableturner = high damage (use two or three times to defeat it)
- samurai + Spare Change + Invincible + millions of gil = up to 99999 damage
- lady luck + Bribe + 60000 gil = victory
- lady luck + 777 on Random Reels = victory
- berserker's Eject, trainer's Carrier Flurry or Kogoro Strike, thief's Steal
Will = eject effect (of course, if it connects)
- draining all of its MP (three Soul Springs will do it, or two if you use
mastered alchemist)
- dark knight with 5000+ MAX HP + Charon = 9999 damage

That is for RGF - but what about OSF? I consider it easier. No Flare, Berserk,
Magic Up and Absorb - instead you'll see lv3 element magic, Full-Cure, Regen
and Ultima (of course). Set yourself up for the battle by casting Reflect on
both your girls and Element. Doing so ensures you'll be getting Full-Cures and
Regens Element would otherwise cast on itself. Also no worries - Element's AI
isn't advanced enough to distinguish from who's under reflect - it'll always
cast element magic on you and damage itself with it. But there's still fear
from Ultima, its most powerful MATK. Having high MDEF and shell may just be
enough to survive it - otherwise Magical Masque from songstress ensures no
damage taken.

Let me address some of common misconceptions players are having.
- Ultima cannot be reflected, never has been, never will be
- Flare can be reflected, as well as Berserk
- fortunately Black Elemental is stupid enough to cast offensive magics on
your girls instead of being smart and reflect it off itself (as it has innate
Auto-Reflect ability)
*****************************************************************************

After you dismantle this easy so-called-ex-boss, you'll find a chest with all
sorts of goodies: MOON BRACER ACC, SHINING BRACER ACC, SPEED BRACER ACC,
RECOVERY BRACER ACC and CAT NIP ACC. Cat Nip is awarded if you're playing US
version - those with japanese version will receive Enterprise instead. Go save
your game, then brave next 20 floors. On floor 60 (don't forget to go save by
examining blue teleporter behind you!)...

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
You may have seen its cousin Shell Shocker? It roams the areas of Moonflow and
you've prolly kicked its ass so hard it kissed the moons, yes? Well, be
prepared for same to happen to you, for this is *the* defensive sucker of the
game (if I don't count Mr T.). Big DEF and MDEF, and to top it off it also has
Auto-Wall properties. Tough cookie indeed. Take note that boss can only attack
one girl at a time, meaning that unless you really screw up, you'll always
have two girls to be able to act at any given time.

For this battle you'll want to have your girls to have high STR in order to
penetrate Conch's high defenses. Forget about DEF stat, it isn't needed -
Megaton Press does up to 99999 damage on single girl anyway, so why bother?
Equipping Rabite's Foot is also an option to consider - girls will inflict
critical damage, and have pretty good chances at evading Conch's 'lick'
attack. Press will hit regardless of stats, so just take the punishment and
use Phoenix Down afterwards to revive fallen girl. All that's left is Gunk -
what it does is drain all MP of girl that has been hit as well as adding
poison - but a swift Antidote will fix the situation before any serious harm
can be done. Still it may take you a lot of time to bust it up.

Yet another OSF battle, which is easier IMO in this form. Conch loses Megaton
Press and Gunk, and instead gains four new MATK, and another form of PATK
(which is used very rarely). Conch usually begins the battle by using Slurp on
one of the girls - beside taking mgd it inflicts itchy, but a quick
spherechange is all that's needed. Still, if you don't wanna bother, use
Remedy or Holy Water. Set up reflect to have Thundaga and Flare (which is also
capable of hitting all three girls at once!) bounce back to Conch and damage
it instead. Demi's damage can be shrugged off easily by having Gravity Eater
(Downtrodder GG).

As for RGF, have high STR for OSF as well. Inflicting phd is far more
efficient than charging up for MATK - anyway, Conch will take care of damaging
itself with mgd, remember? Conch's Thundaga and Flare will hit single girl
from start, but will be used against whole team when Conch gets quite low on
HP. At this time Conch gains access to Radular Grudge, quite dangerous move -
girl hit becomes confused, silenced, darknessed and poisoned (Rikku uses Dark
Matter on them girls - nooooo!). Do be aware of this danger and react
accordingly before it becomes too late. When OSF Conch is finally KO-ed,
there'll be an animation where its shell becomes destroyed, and then Conch
itself pyreflies its way into better existence. Worth the effort? You be the
judge.

You still have problems cracking its hide? Then you may want to consider
following cheesy options.
- gunner in critical HP + Trigger Happy Lv3 + Cat Nip = 9999 barrage
- samurai + Spare Change + Invincible + millions of gil = up to 99999 damage
- lady luck + Bribe + 2000000 gil = victory
- lady luck + 777 on Random Reels = victory
*****************************************************************************

Wooot? No rewards? A crappy Blessed Gem??? Or Crystal Gloves if you were
lucky... Them bastards! Ahem, I'm straying off the path... anyway, do save
your game, as next 20 floors of Via Infinito are hell to be taken. When you
finally reach floor 80 (don't forget to go save by examining blue teleporter
behind you!)...

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
Anyone remember her? I dunno what Square is thinking, but they seem to want to
make hot babes to be conquered as hard as possible. Chac is no exception -
unless you know what you're doing, you'll be sent to Farplane faster than you
can say 'Heaven's Cat'.

First and most obvious toughie players have is Stony Glare. It will petrify
your girl regardless of what she's wearing. Take note of that, REGARDLESS! So
you'll need to have Softs and Remedies handy - counteract immediately, before
Chac moves in with 'bash', which will shatter petrified girl. While I'm
mentioning 'bash' - Chac possesses high STR stat, so you better have high DEF
and Auto-Protect whipped up.

And then there's Heaven's Cataract, a sweet attack which really messes you up
- aside from dealing big mgd it also lowers 5 attributes by -10 (TEN!) levels.
Geez, thanks a lot, how can I survive that? MDEF of 255 and shell reduce the
damage from Heaven's Cat to around 1000 damage.

Okay, jokes aside, here's the strategy I've pulled together after considering
my fighting options. Optimum party is three samurai girls with Dismissal ACTA
learned, Ray of Hope GG, Bushido Tome acc and Rabite's Foot acc. What good
will this do? For one, Chac's 'bash' will MISS if girl's LUCK stat is high,
which is ensured by equipping Ray of Hope GG and Rabite's Foot. And, unlike
most other bosses, Chac *isn't* immune to delay effect and action-cancel.
Prior to battle turn battle speed in Config menu to medium or slow.

So what do you do? Simply enter the battle with three howling samurais and
start launching Dismissal on Chac's ass. Thanks to Bushido Tome acc charge
time for Dismissal is cut by 40% and you could simply tape down X button and
go watch TV or something. It helps if girls are in critical HP with SOS
Critical PASA mastered - twice the damage, twice the fun.

Of course, there are two slight things that might go wrong. One is that you
might run out of MP for casting Dismissal, in which case you'll need to have
that girl use Ether or Turbo Ether on herself. And in rare occassion where
Chac's 'bash' might connect, to revive fallen girl as soon as you can.

Additional hot party to consider is three warriors with Delay Buster ACTA
learned, Ray of Hope GG, Sword Tome acc and Rabite's Foot acc. What good will
this do? For one, Chac's 'bash' will MISS if girl's LUCK stat is high, which
is ensured by equipping Ray of Hope GG and Rabite's Foot. And, unlike most
other bosses, Chac *isn't* immune to delay effect and action-cancel. Enter the
battle and start using Delay Busters VS Chac - unless her first attack is
'bash', she will never get her attack off cos you'll keep delaying it forever
and ever.

OSF battle for a change of pace, you say? While this battle is considered
easier by some (Chac doesn't use Heaven's Cat), but still Chac will make sure
to keep you on your toes. Her Stony Glare still petrifies regardless of
protection, and she has the ability to shatter your Softs and Remedies, as
well as cause MP damage and poison with her regular PATK. Hunter's Gaze is
nothing to be feared of, as it merely denotes that girl targeted will be
attacked next turn. Even in OSF, Chac has retained her weakness to delay and
action-cancel attacks, which is once again one of highly recommended ways of
taking her out. With a bang. Take care of lifting petrification status
promptly and you'll have no problems beating her.

You still have problems spanking Chac? Then you may want to try these cheesy
options.
- gunner in critical HP + Trigger Happy Lv3 + Cat Nip = 9999 barrage
- samurai + Spare Change + Invincible + millions of gil = up to 99999 damage
- lady luck + Bribe + 2000000 gil = victory
- lady luck + 777 on Random Reels = victory
- berserker's Eject, trainer's Carrier Flurry or Kogoro Strike, thief's Steal
Will = eject effect (of course, if it connects)
- if Chac is oversouled, she won't be using Heaven's Cat
*****************************************************************************

Woohoo, we've won! *checks inventory* Shining Gem? Pixie Dust? Gimme back my
money!!! Okay, with her out of the way there's just 20 more floors to go.
Again, go save your progress and continue. Beware, from floor 81 onward you'll
be meeting Aranea, Black Elemental, Concherer and Chac as regular enemies,
with Elder Drake as an added bonus. Remaining fiends worth mentioning -
Lacerta, Mushroom Cloud, Insect Matriarch and Critical Bug are also to be met
on these floors. Aranea, Black, Mushroom Cloud and perhaps Elder can be
dispatched easy, but Conchy and Chac ain't worth time lost, so just escape
from them. Floor 100, here we come! Heyheyhey, don't forget to go save by
examining blue teleporter behind you before you approach the sinister figure
waiting silently for you...

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
Maybe it's just me, but it seems to me that Paragon and Mr T. combo has been
souped up way too much to be taken on with regular attacks. Not counting
Paragon, who's class of its own, Mr T. packs 255 stats in STR, MAG, DEF and
MDEF. Hell, my dark knight with 255 STR and 241 LUCK hit Mr T. for measly 500
damage. I suggest meeting following requirements before taking on Paragon.

- Make sure you oversoul Paragon! This is important! Look why - regular
Paragon is able to connect with all of his physical attacks. If Paragon is
oversouled, his physical attacks will MISS. Which is funny, since its ACC is
higher in oversoul state. Anyway, causing it to oversoul should be quite easy.
Just fight Omega Weapon on Farplane and kill ten of them before one oversouls.
Now run away and Paragon is all set for oversouling.
- Girls all Lv99.
- Party was two dark knights with Darkness and mastered alchemist.
- Garment Grid Valiant Lustre (in right slot insert Berserker, in top slot
Warrior, in left slot Dark Knight, in bottom slot Alchemist - you'll see why
later).
- Dark knights were equipped with Defense Bracer (or Shining Bracer) and
Rabite's Foot (rare drop from Jumbo Cactuar). Why? Once you drain Mr T.'s MP,
all that he has left are physical attacks - three of them hit targets
regardless of EVA and LUCK. Mr T. has three other punching attacks - one
drains MP, one induces stop and one poisons. This is where Rabite's Foot comes
in - it helps you AVOID all of latter three attacks I mentioned.
- Alchemist was equipped with Adamantite and Rabite's Foot.
- Items I've used were: Soul Spring (Bribe Wight or Lich), Stamina Tonic, 99
Mega-Potions and 99 Megalixirs (Bribe Earth Worm) after being struck with
Meteor

Now that you're set, go to Config and change ATB speed to medium or slow, and
Spherechange to 'short'. Engage!

This battle will be played by a bit of real-life luck. If Paragon manages to
pull off Big Bang, reset and reload. Your objective is to defeat Paragon
before it uses Big Bang - even at maximum  MDEF this attack causes around
25000 damage. As battle starts, have one girl toss Star Curtain. Now pay
attention. Paragon doesn't attack at all as battle starts, but will counter
any physical attacks when attacked.

MAKE SURE ALL THREE GIRLS ATTACK AT THE SAME TIME! Doing so will give you
chain effect, increasing the damage for second and third hit. DO NOT ATTACK
PARAGON WHILE IT'S IN THE ATTACK MOTION, as chain effects aren't registered.
After reducing Paragon's HP by 75%, it'll Dispel reflect you have on - now be
careful! Immediately toss Star Curtain again to force it to cast Dispel again
- other two girls always keep attacking! Paragon will either Dispel your
reflect or cast one of Lv3 element magics for about four or five of its turns,
and will then release either Genesis or Final Impact.

If Genesis was used, too bad. Retry. If Final Impact was used, all is not lost
yet. Chances are high all girls are still operational - use Megalixir FIRST,
while other two girls keep attacking. If Paragon falls now, Megalixir is still
used at end of battle thanks to a funny glitch.

You still have problems nailing Paragon? Then you may want to try these cheesy
options.
- gunner in critical HP + Trigger Happy Lv3 + Cat Nip = 9999 barrage
- samurai + Spare Change + Invincible + millions of gil = up to 99999 damage
- lady luck + Bribe + 1000000 gil = victory
- lady luck + 777 on Random Reels = victory
- if Paragon is oversouled, and your LUCK is so-so, most of its physicals
won't connect

Did you know that after wasting Mr T., which comes immediately after Paragon,
you can fight the latter as much as you want? Simply revisit floor 100, and
approach the Tonberry in the back and examine it. Paragon will now fight you.
Here's some more tips and tricks you can use against it:
- if you're fighting regular Paragon, *never* use any attacks on it which
cannot be reduced by shell or protect - some example are Darkness, Absorb or
1000 Needles; if you do that anyway, it will counter by launching Big Bang
- RGF Paragon doesn't have much of a variety of attacks as it does were you to
duel it in OSF - nonetheless, you shouldn't underestimate it; Genesis will
annoy you by removing temporary POSSE you've set up, while its 'punch' takes
care of the suspension... will it be poison, itchy or confusion status? Better
yet, will Paragon drain girls' HP and add it to own HP? You better hope latter
doesn't happen, in which case it may recover up to 9999 HP
- having DEF and MDEF near the peak is almost a must in this duel

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BOSS STRATEGY
Start of battle is important. As soon as first girl is up, spherechange from
berserker to warrior. Thanks to 'short' setting for spherechange we set up in
Config, Mr T. is not able to attack during these scenes - BUT YOU CAN SELECT
SPHERECHANGES FOR OTHER TWO GIRLS DURING THIS TIME, ADDING +40 TO DEF STAT.
After warrior spherechange to dark knight for all three girls, and finally
have the girl with Adamantite on change into alchemist. Now one dark knight
uses Stamina Tonic, other dark knight uses Megalixir and alchemist uses Soul
Spring on Mr T. Woosh - all his MP are gone. No more Demi, Flare and Ultima
(Ultima becomes available to Mr T. after he loses 75% of HP, but he'll cast it
only once).

Now it's just the matter of dark knights using Darkness (it will take off
about 5000 HP of Mr T.'s health) and alchemist tossing Mega-Potions or
Megalixirs, whatever is needed more. For all it's worth, you can simply tape
down X button and go watch a movie.

As far as Mr T.'s physicals go, he will always chain Dying Star, Falling Leaf
and Thundering Wave together. He may use all three attacks against same girl,
or use first part of the chain against Yuna, second against Paine and third
against Rikku. As I advised before, high LUCK you have cos of Rabite's Foot
will keep Moon, Mire and Mist at bay.

Last worry you prolly have is Mr T.'s Meteor? Well, I'm here to tell you
*exactly* when to expect it to strike! It will be used twice throughout the
battle - first time after Mr T. loses 50% HP, and second time after Mr T.
loses 75% of HP. Meteor is PHYSICAL ATTACK, and damage it does can be reduced
with Protect, which is already set in place with Defense Bracer - what's more,
it can be reduced to laughable 1 HP per hit by warrior's Sentinel. To make
sure you're not wiped out, ALWAYS KEEP GIRLS' HP ABOVE 75%, which shouldn't be
a problem with your alchemist.

What is bad about my strategy is that it takes a long time - battle lasted
around 30 minutes using these setup. The good part is that you don't need to
ever worry about dying. Following attacks are very recommended to be used
against Trema: gunner's Tableturner or Cheap Shot, samurai's Sparkler or
Fireworks, gun mage's Annihilator or Mortar, mascot's Cactling Gun or Moogle
Beam - all of these attacks ignore DEF or MDEF, or deal higher damage to
enemies with big DEF.
*****************************************************************************

After this grueling battle is won, you nab IRON DUKE ACC, the best in the
game. With this you've conquered and mastered Via Infinito. Also, Paragon can
now be fought infinitely on floor 100. Simply go to that floor and check the
far north end of the room. Examine Tonberry standing there and fight to your
heart's content.

What you see below are all minigames I will cover. I will not cover the basics
on how to play Sphere Break or blitzball. Too much stuff to take into account,
and I certainly don't wanna do blitzball again (not after doing it for FFX).
Anyway, FFX-2 game itself has a pretty extensive tutorials on how to play both

GUNNER'S GAUNTLET RULES AND REGULATIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
AVAILABLE?: Besaid, CH2, CH3, CH5
START?    : Talk to Beclem on 'B - village slope', or address one of Aurochs,
            if playing in CH5
OBJECTIVE?: Make it to the beach within alloted time limit and score higher
            than Beclem's record to win the prize
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Left stick - move Yuna
Circle     - lock on nearest target
X          - fire gun
Square     - change between current target and last fiend targeted
R1, L1     - scroll thru different types of available ammo
Triangle   - upgrades selected ammo

As you wander from 'B - village slope' to 'B - beach', you'll encounter
fiends. Notice Yuna's HP in upper right corner - each time fiend manages to
take a bite off Yuna, her HP will decrease. If it's reduced to zero, current
session of Gunner's Gauntlet is over.

Press Circle to lock onto nearest target (if target is out of range, you may
need to get closer in order to get a lock on it). Target's HP will be
displayed to the right. Press X to fire onto locked target. Rounds fired will
*always* connect. However, you may need time to reload every now and then.

Keep firing until fiend's HP is reduced to zero. Don't forget to regularly
check up on your ammo count, which is displayed just below Yuna's HP - you
don't wanna run out of it. Luckily defeated fiends drop behind chests which
contain extra ammo for Yuna to take. So always make sure to pick up chests
after killing your target.

In case you encounter more fiends together (let's say two), pressing Circle
will lock onto nearest one (let's call it fiend A). Be careful - if fiend B
tries to attack Yuna, you won't be able to defend against fiend B for as long
as you're locked onto the fiend A. You will need to press Circle quickly -
doing so will shift lock on onto fiend B, since it is closer than fiend A.

Sometimes you will find special types of ammo in chests, Dual Shot being first
one you'll come across. Box displaying amount of Dual Shot ammo will appear
beneath regular ammo box. Press Circle to lock on two closest targets. Select
Dual Shot ammo using L1 or R1 button. Now you can fire at both targets at once
with X. In case one of two fiends falls sooner, it's a waste to keep shooting
with Dual Shot ammo, so remember to switch back to regular ammo.

Death ammo is second most potent ammo with the ability to kill target fiend
with a single shot. Death ammo box appears below Dual Shot ammo box. Press
Circle to select a target and then X to gun it down. Once you've acquired
multiple types of ammo, use L1 and R1 to choose the most effective one.

Volley ammo is the most powerful ammo you can find. It has the ability to kill
all on-screen enemies at once. Volley ammo box appears below Death ammo box.
Just select Volley ammo and press X for some major ownage.

Once you reach Lv6 challenge of Gunner's Gauntlet, you will have the ability
of getting upgrades by defeating certain fiends. The number of upgrades you
have is shown in blue to the left of your ammo counter. Select an ammo and
press Triangle to convert two rounds of that ammo to one round of the next
grade of ammo.

Once you reach Lv7 challenge of Gunner's Gauntlet, you will have the ability
of getting Quick Shot item from defeated fiends. Quick Shot enables rapid-fire
attacks for a short periods of time. An additional bar showing time remaining
will appear below Chain gauge.

As you topple fiends, a Chain Gauge at the bottom of the screen gradually
fills. Reaching set locations on the gauge greatly increases the number of
points you receive for killing fiends. When gauge reads 'Chain 1', you receive
fixed amount of points for each defeated fiend. When it reads 'Chain 2', you
receive double amount of points. When it reads 'Chain 3', amount of points
awarded is tripled! That's your chance to score big. Be warned: the gauge
resets if you're hit. Each hit also causes points to be decreased by one.

Now I'll take care of filling you in on how many difficulty levels there are,
what is the score needed to advance to next level and what are the rewards.

LEVEL | SCORE | REWARD                | LEVEL | SCORE | REWARD
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lv1   | 500   | Enigma Plate GG       | Lv2   | 750   | Power Wrist
Lv3   | 900   | Silver Bracer         | Lv4   | 1000  | Titanium Bangle
Lv5   | 1150  | Mortal Coil GG        | Lv6   | 1300  | Beaded Brooch
Lv7   | 1400  | Diamond Gloves        | Lv8   | 2000  | Faerie Earrings
Lv9   | 2800  | Adamantite            | LvMAX | -     | nothing

BESAID CLOISTER GUNNER'S GAUNTLET RULES AND REGULATIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
AVAILABLE?: Besaid, CH3, CH5
START?    : Talk to the monk at the entrance to the cloister
OBJECTIVE?: Make it to the end within alloted time limit and score big
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Left stick - move Yuna's view around
Circle     - lock on nearest target
X          - fire gun
Square     - change between current target and last fiend targeted
R1, L1     - scroll thru different types of available ammo
Triangle   - upgrades selected ammo

As you wander from start of the cloister to the end, you will notice a big
difference - first person view! Notice Yuna's HP in upper right corner - each
time fiend manages to take a bite off Yuna, her HP will decrease. If it's
reduced to zero, current session of Gunner's Gauntlet is over.

Press Circle to lock onto nearest target (if target is out of range, you may
need to get closer in order to get a lock on it). Target's HP will be
displayed to the right. Press X to fire onto locked target. Rounds fired will
*always* connect. However, you may need time to reload every now and then.

Keep firing until fiend's HP is reduced to zero. Don't forget to regularly
check up on your ammo count, which is displayed just below Yuna's HP - you
don't wanna run out of it. Luckily defeated fiends drop behind extra ammo,
which is automatically added to Yuna's ammo counters.

In case you encounter more fiends together (let's say two), pressing Circle
will lock onto nearest one (let's call it fiend A). Be careful - if fiend B
tries to attack Yuna, you won't be able to defend against fiend B for as long
as you're locked onto the fiend A. You will need to press Circle quickly -
doing so will shift lock on onto fiend B, since it is closer than fiend A.

Dual Shot is the first special ammo type you'll come across. Box displaying
amount of Dual Shot ammo will appear beneath regular ammo box. Press Circle to
lock on two closest targets. Select Dual Shot ammo using L1 or R1 button. Now
you can fire at both targets at once with X. In case one of two fiends falls
sooner, it's a waste to keep shooting with Dual Shot ammo, so remember to
switch back to regular ammo.

Death ammo is second most potent ammo with the ability to kill target fiend
with a single shot. Death ammo box appears below Dual Shot ammo box. Press
Circle to select a target and then X to gun it down. Once you've acquired
multiple types of ammo, use L1 and R1 to choose the most effective one.

Volley ammo is the most powerful ammo you can find. It has the ability to kill
all on-screen enemies at once. Volley ammo box appears below Death ammo box.
Just select Volley ammo and press X for some major ownage.

Upgrades you get from certain killed fiends allows you to upgrade your lower
ammo class into higher ammo class. The number of upgrades you have is shown in
blue to the left of your ammo counter. Select an ammo and press Triangle to
convert two rounds of that ammo to one round of the next grade of ammo.

Quick Shot item from certain defeated fiends enables rapid-fire attacks for a
short periods of time. An additional bar showing time remaining will appear
below Chain gauge.

As you topple fiends, a Chain Gauge at the bottom of the screen gradually
fills. Reaching set locations on the gauge greatly increases the number of
points you receive for killing fiends. When gauge reads 'Chain 1', you receive
fixed amount of points for each defeated fiend. When it reads 'Chain 2', you
receive double amount of points. When it reads 'Chain 3', amount of points
awarded is tripled! That's your chance to score big. Be warned: the gauge
resets if you're hit.

How about revealing what you can receive from killed fiends?

Ahriman       | 7   | 15  | Quick Shot
Tomb          | 80  | 20  | 1x-2x Death
Flan Azul     | 4   | 2   | 2x-3x HP recovery
Tonberry      | 15  | 20  | 30x-99x Ammo
Mega Tonberry | 20  | 30  | nothing

Here's a short recap of how to navigate this minigame (sent by Vincent V.:

- Start: 1x Coyote
- Downstairs: 1x Coyote
- Moving along until stop, look left and you see a Haunt, kill it for Duals
- Continue on, you must look up left (D-pad press top left) to see a Death
  Dauber kill it get an upgrade - hope for a Dual Shot upgrade to get Death
- Along the way there will be many Creepers - just keep pressing Circle and X
  rapidly and they will be dead
- Next would be Ahriman and Tomb, but ignore Tomb you can't target it for
  now, just blast Ahriman away and you will face front with Tomb
- This is the crucial part
- You will not be moving BUT you can turn to 4 directions
  -> Front - Tomb and occassional Flan
  -> Right - treasure room, Death Dauber randomly appears
  -> Back - Coyotes, they come rather fast, and sometimes in pairs
  -> Left - Haunt, not to worry it's too far.
- Generally, Tomb does NOT attack... but with a health of 80 it is there just
  to block the path, the time given is 12 mins but the actual journey is less
  than 5 mins. You must always look around to make sure no enemies are
  attacking you. I realise most damage comes from Coyotes, they come in pairs
  and the Death Dauber which is quite camouflaged. Haunt comes from very far
  so you will have enough time to kill it.
- If you're lucky to get a Death Shot (2x Dual Shot -> 1x Death Shot) from
  the earlier Death Dauber, we'll use it to kill the Tomb and continue to the
  Tonberry hall later on.
- Generally, when you are fighting Tomb, constantly look behind and left to
  make sure there are no fiends attacking you, anyway u need around 200+ Ammo
  to kill all those Tonberries. Take note it is NOT Tomb attackin it's the
  other fiends.
- I recommend wasting the fiends until you get a volley shot, (2x Death Shot
  -> 1x Volley), and some health from Flan.
- On to the Tonberry slaughter, basically its down to skills now.
- Here's a guide, aim the NEAREST TONBERRY, contantly pressing Circle will
  aim the nearest and once you give it 6 normal shots, immediately press
  Square and shoot the next nearest Tonberry, doing this 3 times will kill
  two nearest Tonberries.
- What if there are three? Use the Dual Shot, shoot 6 shots to two nearest
  Tonberries fast, third one will overtake the other two being shot, now
  press Circle and shoot third Tonberry six times with normal Ammo, now press
  Circle again and the other two will come again. Use Dual Shot again, this
  time their HP left would be 3 HP and the third one with 9 HP, depending on
  how near they are. If they're still aprox half screen away just blast the
  third one with normal shots and auto-lock on the other two will simply kill
  them.
- Note when targeting another fiend will immediately allow you to shoot
  without cooldown time.
- What about the Ahriman in the screen? If you have a chance, kill it, it
  gives it Quick Shot. Great advantage to killing Tonberries.
- Once you are able to handle them Tonberries, the screen will move forward -
  ups the difficulty. After slaugthering more karma hunters screen will move
  again, only this is the last time. You will be so close to the Tonberry
  spawn point that you can't kill them fast enough.
- Notice that there is another mystery target! If you can't take them on now,
  use Volley and then AIM the mystery target - this is the GOAL.
- Shoot it, door will open and you win!

THUNDER PLAINS TOWER CALIBRATION RULES AND REGULATIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
AVAILABLE?: Thunder p., CH2, CH3
START?    : Talk to kneeling Al Bhed near S most tower in 'TP - south'
OBJECTIVE?: Calibrate at least five towers to receive Samurai's Honor GG
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In short, you must complete the sequence 30 times, and are allowed to mess up
3 times. Take too long to enter commands and it counts as a mess up. Towers
are marked by green squares on the minimap - examine them by pressing X and
complete the sequence. Button sequences and display patterns vary from tower
to tower.

TOWER | WHO   | WHAT TO DO              | AVAILABLE COMMANDS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1     | Rikku | press buttons displayed | X, Circle, Triangle, Square
2     | Paine | watch falling buttons,  | X, Circle, Triangle, Square
      |       | whichever flashes, must | directionals
      |       | be entered              |
3     | Yuna  | memorize the pattern,   | X, Circle, Triangle, Square
      |       | then when prompted press|
      |       | same buttons            |
4     | Rikku | press buttons displayed | X, Circle, Triangle, Square
      |       |                         | directionals
5     | Paine | watch falling buttons,  | X, Circle, Triangle, Square, L1
      |       | whichever flashes, must | R1, directionals
      |       | be entered              |
6     | Yuna  | memorize the pattern,   | X, Circle, Triangle, Square
      |       | then when prompted press| directionals
      |       | same buttons            |
7     | Rikku | press *BOTH* buttons    | X, Circle, Triangle, Square, L1
      |       | displayed simultaneously| R1, directionals
8     | Paine | watch falling buttons,  | X, Circle, Triangle, Square, L1
      |       | whichever flashes, must | R1, directionals
      |       | be entered              |
9     | Yuna  | memorize the pattern,   | X, Circle, Triangle, Square, L1
      |       | then when prompted press| R1, directionals
      |       | same buttons            |
10*   | Yuna  | memorize the pattern,   | X, Circle, Triangle, Square, L1
      |       | then when prompted press| L2, R1, R2, directionals
      |       | same buttons in REVERSE |
      |       | order                   |
* - Tower 10 is located to the W of tower 8. Walk as far left as you can and
keep mashing X.

Rikku's towers will prompt you to input commands faster as the amount of
successful hits racks up. As you score hits in Paine's towers, her button
sequences will start falling faster and may feature additional commands you
will need to be paying attention to. Finally, Yuna's towers - more hits you
have, faster the button string will be appearing and less time you'll be given
to input the string (of course, expect to see more buttons to be pressed; if
that's still not enough, amount of different buttons increases too).

Contributor wizardzen comments: Actually I have quite a easy way to calibrate
the 10th tower. For 10th tower just keep on using your mind power till around
21st hit (the last 4 blocks). Then for the next 5 blocks, most likely you may
miss but never mind that if you still have misses to spare. The trick will be
to take out a piece of paper and write the buttons down in reverse order, then
press the correct buttons while looking at the paper. It is definitely
possible as the game slows down in the end.

All in all, one of the reasons for this minigame is to score Samurai's Honor
GG in CH2 or CH3. Easiest way to obtain it is to calibrate towers 1, 2, 3, 4
and 6 by entering 30 commands successfully - you must also attempt the
remaining five towers at least once. Then go to 'TP - agency', talk to male Al
Bhed inside and GG is yours. Also, amount of successful calibrations will
dictate the awards you get in CH5 - for example, should you succeed in
entering 30 commands for 10th tower, you'd get Ribbon acc in CH5 from that
tower.

All in all, this minigame isn't worthy of your time in my opinion. Any of the
prizes can be scored in other, easier ways.

EVERYTHING'S COMING UP CACTUARS RULES AND REGULATIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
AVAILABLE?: Spira, CH3, CH5
START?    : Visit Cactuar Nation in CH3 or CH5 in Bikanel; select [That made
            perfect sense!]
OBJECTIVE?: Each time you find a Cactuar, shoot it down!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
X        - fire gun
R1       - evade Cactuar's counterattacks

Be the first to witness the power the Gatekeeper acquired during his travels.
He's teamed up with his newfound friends, and they're coming right for you!
Conserve your ammo, time your shots carefully, and show that prickly punk how
it's done!

Once the game starts, your screen will split in two parts - the left half will
keep switching between target Cactuar and two sidekicks (higher Cactuar's AGL
is, faster the screen will switch), while Yuna occupies the right half.

Your task is to anticipate when the Cactuar will appear in left half and pull
the trigger by pressing X. If you are lucky enough to capture Cactuar
offguard, you will score a hit and reduce Cactuar's HP by one. Now you can
either keep shooting and hoping that more hits will connect, or give up and
wait for next opportunity.

Be careful, for sometimes Cactuar will retaliate by shooting needles at you.
Be prepared for these events and make use of that R1 button. If needling
connects, you lose ammo equal to Cactuar's STR.

Your cact-war game will end if you run out of bullets, either by getting
needled too much or shooting off one time too many.

CACTUAR NUMERO 01: Lobivia,     HP 10, STR 3, AGL 2
CACTUAR NUMERO 02: Toumeya,     HP 10, STR 3, AGL 3
CACTUAR NUMERO 03: Lobeira,     HP 12, STR 7, AGL 2
CACTUAR NUMERO 04: Areq,        HP 16, STR 6, AGL 4
CACTUAR NUMERO 05: Arroja (appears together with Areq)
CACTUAR NUMERO 06: Islaya,      HP 12, STR 6, AGL 5
CACTUAR NUMERO 07: Chiapa,      HP 9,  STR 6, AGL 4
CACTUAR NUMERO 08: Erio,        HP 15, STR 8, AGL 4
CACTUAR NUMERO 09: Bartschella, HP 12, STR 8, AGL 5
CACTUAR NUMERO 1O: Frailea      HP 10, STR 6, AGL 3

After each cact-war you're given an evaluation of your performance. Score
awarded is based on following factors: win bonus, remaining ammo bonus, dodge
penalty, needle penalty and miss penalty. Your high score will be assessed and
displayed when all bonuses and penalties are deducted.

So, what really is main objective to this minigame? It must be completed to be
able to face Angra Mainyu in mortal battle in CH5. Additionally, should you
manage to conquer Frailea in cact-war, you receive Covenant of Growth GG (once
you defeat Angra, you can go back to Cactuar Nation - you'll see all 10
Cactuars standing in a circle; seek out Frailea and challenge it again, if you
missed getting GG first time around).

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
------------ A - EXPLANATION OF SPECIFIC FIEND ENTRIES? - G20001 ------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

1. NAME ENTRY
   This will contain fiend's name, and info on which species it belongs to.

2. STATISTICS ENTRY*
   HP  - Amount of HP fiend has. When it's depleted to 0 (zero), fiend is
         defeated and disappears from battlefield.
   MP  - Amount of MP fiend has. When it's depleted to 0 (zero), fiend can no
         longer use attacks, which require MP. If fiend is oversouled, it has
         innate Spellspring status, meaning it can use MP-consuming abilities
         even if fiend's MP is zero.
   EXP - Amount of EXP fiend drops when defeated.
   AP  - Amount of AP fiend drops when defeated.
   GIL - Amount of gil fiend drops when defeated.
   FIR - Fiend's fire affinities. It can be WKN (fiend takes double damage
         from fire attacks), NTH (normal damage), HLV (damage is halved), IMM
         (fiend takes no damage from fire attacks), ABS (fire damage is
         converted into HP recovery).
   ICE - Fiend's ice affinities. For more info see FIR sub-entry.
   LIG - Fiend's lightning affinities. For more info see FIR sub-entry.
   WAT - Fiend's water affinities. For more info see FIR sub-entry.
   GRA - Fiend's gravity affinities. For more info see FIR sub-entry.
   HOL - Fiend's holy affinities. For more info see FIR sub-entry.
* note - Second line of statistics apply to fiend's oversouled form.

3. STATUS IMMUNITY ENTRY
   Here I will list all statuses fiend is immune to. Statuses marked in []
   parenthesis are statuses fiend is immune to when in oversouled form.
   NOTE: Most fiends also sport resistance to some statuses. Let's say Test
   Subject here would have 50% resistance to KO - this means that you have
   50% chance of successfully inducing KO when attacking with such skills.
   However, as this information is not available thru Scan screen, I won't
   put it down. ALL fiends have resistance to Zantetsuken status, which can
   only be induced by samurai's Zantetsu MCWc. Also, Zantetsuken =/= KO! They
   are two different statuses.
   Finally, ALL fiends are immune to Auto-Life status.

4. DROP, STEAL, BRIBE ENTRY
   Contains information on which items you can obtain by:
   DROP, OS-DROP   - info on items gained from the fiend after battle; items
                     in [] parenthesis can be gained from oversouled fiend
   STEAL, OS-STEAL - info on items stolen from the fiend during battle; items
                     in [] parenthesis can be stolen from oversouled fiend
   BRIBE, OS-BRIBE - info on items bribed from the fiend during battle; items
                     in [] parenthesis can be bribed from oversouled fiend;
                     amount of bribed items varies greatly and is based on
                     amount of gil you used for Bribe - therefore only name
                     of item will be noted, NOT the amount
   First line of items listed is common drop/steal/bribe, ie items you'll get
   most of the time. Second line of items listed is rare drop/steal/bribe, ie
   items you're less likely to receive.

5. ATTACKS ENTRY
   Information on fiend's attacks it has to offer. Listed will be information
   on what is the type of the attack used, who it targets and much more.
   Attack name   - attacks used by fiend in regular form only
   <Attack name> - attacks used by fiend in both regular and oversouled form
   [Attack name] - attacks used by fiend in oversouled form only
   'Attack name' - attacks used by fiend, but are given no name, so I made it

6. FIGHTING TIPS ENTRY
   This will include some cheesy tips and tricks to make your life in battle
   vs this specific fiend easier.

--------------- C - UNDERSTANDING SAMPLE FIEND ENTRY? - G20003 --------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I've tried to come up with a compact way of showing as much info as I can
within as little space as possible. I believe I've done a pretty good job.
Still, there are few things you may get confused at, so allow me to assist you
in explaining how to read the chart. Let's get to it!

1. NAME ENTRY
   Nothing too scary here, right? Just the name and species it belongs to.

2. STATISTICS ENTRY
   Okay, you see two lines of stats? First applies to fiend's regular form,
   while second applies to oversouled form. Usually the enemy is harder to
   defeat in oversouled form, but it's not always so. Anyway...
   First line  - fiend has 100000 HP and 170 MP, and drops 6000 EXP, 1 AP and
                 1200 gil when defeated. As for elemental affinities, nothing
                 interesting except its immunity to gravity.
   Second line - now you'll see some major changes - fiend has 200000 HP and
                 340 MP, and drops 9000 EXP, 2 AP and 2400 gil when defeated.
                 As for elemental affinities, they have changed too. It is no
                 longer immune to gravity, instead it absorbs fire and ice.

3. STATUS IMMUNITY ENTRY
   Listed here are many statuses fiend is immune to. To name a few: sleep,
   silence, slow, stop, curse... But what's that - [DOOM]? If doom status
   will be boxed in like this, it means that fiend is susceptible to doom
   while in regular form, but IMMUNE to doom if it's oversouled. Same thing
   applies for delay-effect and action-cancel statuses in this example.
   Statuses boxed in <> are POSSE always present on the fiend, like Black
   Elemental's Auto-Reflect, for example.

4. DROP, STEAL, BRIBE ENTRY
   Fiend drops Blessed Gem as common item, and Crystal Gloves as rare item.
   If oversouled, common drop is Crystal Gloves, and rare Fire Gem.
   You can commonly steal Ether, or rarely 2x Ether.
   If oversouled, fiend has nothing to be stolen.
   You can commonly bribe for White Lore acc, or rarely for Bushido Tome acc.
   If oversouled, both common & rare bribe yield Bushido Tome acc!
   Got the hang of it? Good! Also note that fiends which cannot be oversouled
   will not have OS part subentries.

5. ATTACKS ENTRY
   Of three attacks fiend is capable of using...
   <'Bash'> - this one is used in both regular and oversoul form
   Thunder - used in regular form only
   [Infinity Ray] - used in oversoul form only

---------------- D - LAST MINUTE CHANGES AND NOTES? - G20004 ----------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

1. Fiends that appear only once or are tied to storyline will not appear
   here, as I've covered them to death in relevant boss entries found in main
   walkthru. Some example: Mr T., Dark B., Fatso etc.
2. Nagging cos you can't find item you're searching for in fiend entry? Short
   name given should clue you in enough to figure out with ease what's that
   Chocobo Fthr or Faerie Earns you're looking for.
3. Nothing else to add, except have fun killing anything that comes your way.
4. Fiends that are NOT mentioned here (Cactuar for example) can be found in
   the walkthru part of the document, because they are encountered as the
   part of some other major boss battle.

1. [Sharpened Needle] - VS one chr - phd, dmg slowly increases with each hit
2. 'Sting' - VS one chr - phd
3. W.I.M.P. - VS one chr - phd, induces itchy
4. Sleep Needle - VS one chr - phd, induces sleep
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
RGF battle is often a drag, for Aculeate appears with other fiends and
inflicting itchy at the moment when it's not needed is quite annoying. Also
count in Sleep Needle and you have one annoyance victor - being guarded
against sleep and itchy is a good choice, as is simply having high EVA or
getting Aculeate to suffer from darkness. If you wanna have a laugh, confuse
it and see what happens when fiends get inflicted with itchy. They won't be
able to move at all. Fear the power of spherechange!

OSF Aculeate is easier - Sharpened Needle attack doesn't carry any negative
statuses, but it grows progressively stronger each time Aculeate manages to
land a successful hit. Again high EVA or darkness on Aculeate help rectify the
situation. Both RGF and OSF are susceptible to many NEGSE, so be sure to
exploit them to their fullest advantage.

   MAX HP
5. Defense Up - on self - [increases DEF by +3 levels]
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
One of the tank-fiends you'll encounter. Being extremely resistant to PATK,
this turtle fiend will give you nightmares. Luckily, two of its actions can be
predicted - you can't predict 'bash' and Defense Up, which are used randomly,
but same isn't true for Breath and Tremor. Both of them are used on every 10th
turn turtle gets, but Breath is more common. Probabilities for Tremor to be
used are increased if fiend is low on HP. Still, Tremor can't kill you, while
Breath can - so make sure your HP is shooting thru the roof to survive the
attack. Or have fire guarding stuff equipped to completely null the damage. I
recommend using attacks that ignore target's stats, such as 1000 Needles,
Darkness or Storm Cannon. Gunner's Tableturner is also a good choice.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
One of the tank-fiends you'll encounter. Being extremely resistant to PATK,
this turtle fiend will give you nightmares. Luckily, some of its actions can
be predicted - you can't predict 'bash', Defense and Strength Up, which are
used randomly, but same isn't true for Breath and Tremor. Both of them are used 
on every 10th turn turtle gets, but Breath is more common. Probabilities for
Tremor to be used are increased if fiend is low on HP. Still, Tremor can't
kill you, while Breath can - so make sure your HP is shooting thru the roof to
survive the attack. I recommend using attacks that ignore target's stats, such
as 1000 Needles, Darkness or Storm Cannon. Gunner's Tableturner is also a good
choice.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Tough bastard to defeat cos of Null Physical it has. From start of battle it
likes to bombard you with Flares (will target the girl with highest HP), so
remedy that with reflect. Once its HP is halved, it'll knock Ultima your way,
so be prepared for it. When HP is low, it uses Drain, and Osmose in case MP is
low. Emblem of Thanatos is its biggest threat - used on every 10th turn, it
reduces HP of girls by 62,5% of MAX HP and lessens six attributes! On top of
it you can't reduce it in any way. Enchanted Ammo, 1000 Needles and Darkness
are three of more recommended ways of taking down Aeshma, or simply use any
MATK you have.

3. Poison Fang - VS one chr - phd, induces poison
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Smallest of reptile fiends, but just as annoying, esp with its Poison Fang.
Entering battles against reptiles is recommended with Star Pendants equipped -
or reducing the chances of attack connecting by inflicting darkness and sleep
on Agama, not to mention there's a slew of other statuses you can help
yourself with. Superior EVA is also recommended.

In OSF form Agama loses Poison Fang, but its 'bite' gains the bonus of adding
silence on girl attacked. As PATK are almost always superior in dealing damage
than MATK, you can ignore this status. In addition, whatever damage you
inflicted so far, will be returned to the girl attacked with Desperate Strike.
In this case, maximum damage you can expect to receive is 2124 damage (back
attack bonus, critical bonus). So if you wanna live, have all three gals
concentrate their attacks at Agama in one swift combo. There's no way it can
possibly survive that. Or in more proffesional way - stone it. That way we'll
see just how desperate it really is, hehe.

4. <Lv2 element magic> - VS all chrs - respective type of mgd
5. Barrier Shift - changes elemental properties (except gravity and holy)
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Stars you see in elemental section denote that element weaknesses will change
during battle, depending on actions you take. You have an extremely hard task
at hand here. Pay attention which element magic is used - it means that boss
absorbs that element and is weak to its opposing element. So if Fira is used,
Gel absorbs fire magic, but is weak to ice. Get it? If bastard takes HP or MP
damage in RGF, it will use Barrier Shift, which will change its elemental
affinities. Shift can be used even without you ever attacking it - it does so
to make sure you're always on your toes. What makes gel even more dangerous is
its 'bash', which reduces HP of hit girl to 1.

OSF - 'bash' properties are retained, but Barrier Shift is lost. Gel will,
each time it takes HP or MP damage, change one of element attributes - either
it will become immune to one or will disable already activated immunity.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Poison Fang reptile again - just how many are there? Entering battles against
reptiles is recommended with Star Pendants equipped - or reducing the chances
of attack connecting by inflicting darkness and sleep on Anole, not to mention
there's a slew of other statuses you can help yourself with. Superior EVA is

4. Mind Pecker - VS one chr - std, inflicts MP damage
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
RGF battle is still a piece of cake - like Peregrine, Aquila can cause MP
damage with Mind Pecker as well. Its EVA is superb, making it hard to connect
for physical attacks - in this case you may want to consider using magic
instead? Aquila has no fixed attack pattern.

In OSF battle Aquila loses Mind Pecker, but gains Wild and Muddle Wings, moves
which carry two of most annoying statuses - berserk and confusion. If you get
confused, hit the girl ASAP. You do *not* want her to accidentally use say
Dark Matter against your team. Berserked girl will at least try to attack
right target. As Aquila's EVA is even greater in this state, option to use
magic is even more alluring. Both RGF and OSF have absolutely no status
immunity, so lots of status changes can be abused, mainly darkness and sleep.

enough to reflect the cast off of itself to hit your girl - have Tetra Band or

3. Poison Fang - VS one chr - phd, induces poison
4. Stone Fang - VS one chr - phd, induces petrify
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Be on your toes! Archaethyris (what's with the name?) has Poison Fang, true,
but it also has Stone Fang, which petrifies girl hit. You do NOT want to be a
girl short of success - do you have Gold Anklets or Stoneproof ability (dark
knight has it)? Ideally, also have Star Pendants handy. Reducing the chances
of attack connecting by inflicting darkness and sleep on Arch is yet another
way to conquering this bozo, and superior EVA is also recommended. Arch almost
exclusively uses Stone Fang only - it's a rare treat to see it use regular
'bite' or Poison Fang.

In OSF form Arch loses both Fang attacks, but its 'bite' gains the bonus of
adding darkness on girl attacked - thus making OSF battle much easier than
RGF. In addition, whatever damage you inflicted so far, will be returned to

4. [Shatter Ether] - VS one chr - phd, reduces Ether stock by 1
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Fiend of the fiend class I find very annoying. This guy will alternate between
'bash' and Defense Up moves, which decreases damage it takes from PATK. Using
magic on it is double-edged sword - it is vulnerable to it, but will counter
using Helm Counter, so be prepared for it.

OSF is easier, but more annoying. For starters, it has lost its stupid Defense
Up and Helm Counter moves, but instead gained an attack with which it can
destroy your Ethers. Bust it up with darkness NEGSE, then proceed wailing on
it. As it has so little status immunities, knock yourself out and choose
appropriate means of disposing it. Armet's DEF stat may be high, but its MDEF
stat sucks - so using MATK against it is not a bad idea at all.

2. W.I.M.P. - VS one chr - phd, induces itchy
3. Sleep Needle - VS one chr - phd, induces sleep
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
RGF battle is often a drag, for Bee appears with other fiends and inflicting
itchy at the moment when it's not needed is quite annoying. Also count in
Sleep Needle and you have one annoyance victor - being guarded against sleep
and itchy is a good choice, as is simply having high EVA or getting Bee to
suffer from darkness. If you wanna have a laugh, confuse it and see what
happens when fiends get inflicted with itchy. They won't be able to move at
all. Fear the power of spherechange!

OSF Bee is easier - Sharpened Needle attack doesn't carry any negative
statuses, but it grows progressively stronger each time Bee manages to land a
successful hit. Again high EVA or darkness on Bee help rectify the situation.
Both RGF and OSF are susceptible to many NEGSE, so be sure to exploit them to

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Strongest of ruminant fiends. Besides being strong physical-wise, it possesses
the ability to make your girls hot. Protect for former, and Fireproof or
better for latter. I wonder why Bali has one status less it can be guarded
against - anyway, put it to sleep or inflict darkness on Bali, making it hard
for it to connect with PATK. Let's not forget your favorite slow or stop
statuses.

In OSF Bali has access to few more attacks, namely Berserk and Stampede. It
loses Skewer, BTW. Stampede can only be performed after Bali berserks itself.
Prior to that move you'll have to make due with 'bash' and Fire Breath
attacks. Once Bali has less than 33% HP remaining, it's berserk time. Still,
darkness in effect will prevent it from becoming a serious threat (slow or
stop can be applied as well).

4. [Bio] - VS one chr - induces poison
5. [Confuse] - VS one chr - induces confusion
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Barong of the blades will make your battles against it quite frantic. Unless
you have Poisonproof tucked away somewhere, you'll spend most of the time
curing poison status its regular PATK carries. Blade Rondo, used on each
fourth turn, is very strong and always hits. To reduce damage you'll be
taking, consider these options: Power Break on Barong, or darkness it.
Interesting bit is that it is immune to slow, but not to stop. Then there's
fire attacks to be considered as well.

OSF - You hit it, but it hits back. Heh, Frenzied Edge is the name of the move
that will make your hair grow white pretty soon. Each time Barong takes damage
will be each time Barong counters - and if you're hit four times without
healing inbetween... there goes the KO, for Edge belongs to fractional type
attacks. Blade Rondo is used as 8th move, regardless of past actions it took.
There's still more - Barong gained the ability to cast Bio and Confuse as
well. Be afraid of Confuse and make absolutely sure you can guard against this
status.

'swipe'-s, followed by Thundara - all at the girl with highest current HP.
Employ Sentinel if you can bother enough. For extra challenge berserk it and
see the power of Uppercuts which will send you flying into next Sunday.
Slowing the guy down isn't a shabby idea.

OSF is interesting as well, as its AI is once again pinned on the girl with
highest current HP. Against her it will use [Eyeing (girl)...], followed by
three 'swipe'-s, or three Thundaras. Slow it down or feel the KO.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Fungus corps commander... that's it? Omigosh, sooo dangerous. A lousy Nausea
Powder... let's see, Mycotoxin had same stuff. Biggie also has less HP than
Cloud - helloooo? So, as we established, Biggie doesn't have any elemental
magic to be throwing around in RGF, but instead only used Nausea Powder.
Atchoo! Star Pendants, where are you? Just bust a cap in its ass and it's
defeated - faster disposal can be achieved by using fire attacks.

In OSF things become more interesting. Besides Nausea Powder is has access to
water and fire magic. Reflect, anyone? It can also berserk itself once it has
lost 75% of HP. This berserk state is different though - it doesn't make
Biggie attack physically but instead grants it the ability to cast Flare
(reflect it).

6. [Regen] - on self - induces regen
7. [Magic Down] - on self - MAG power decreases as this fiend's HP drops by
   each 20% you shave off
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
This fiend is not to be joked with. Sporting very high resistance to PATK, it
can easily silence you, unless you pack Silenceproof. Light MATK will make
mincemeat out of Blue, just make sure you don't take too long in destroying it
before its Magic Up (used on every 3rd turn Blue gets) builds up to becoming
too powerful for you to handle. Reflecting its Silence magic will effectively
shut it up.

That is for RGF - but what about OSF? I consider it easier. It loses Watera,
but gains Waterga and Regen. Set yourself up for the battle by casting Reflect
on Element. Doing so ensures you'll be getting Regens Element would otherwise
cast on itself. Also no worries - Element's AI isn't advanced enough to
distinguish from who's under reflect - it'll always cast Regen on itself. To
reduce Waterga's damage, have Waterproof or better. Each time Blue loses 20%
of HP, its MAG stat will decrease, making its MATK less powerful. Effects can
be reversed by raising its HP, but why would you want to do that? Shutting it
up is quite easy - silence it. Draining its MP will not work, cos all OSF
fiends have Spellspring ability, remember?

5. [Strength Down] - on self - STR power decreases as this fiend's HP drops by

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
RGF, with some preparation, isn't annoying. It follows attack pattern of using
three 'bash'-es, followed by its breath attack, then repeat. It's immune to
sleep, but not darkness, which can help you tremendously in evading its
'bash' attacks. Using ice attacks against it is a fast way of racking up
damage and dispatching it to Farplane.

In OSF all drake fiends follow analogy, similar to elemental fiends. Lower
drake's HP gets, lower its strength gets. On the other hand, all drake fiends
are capable of restoring HP with curative magic (set reflect on them to get
the curing instead). When OSF, Bolt Drake gets immunity to confusion and
berserk, but many others can still be applied, most notably darkness. Or
petrifying it for a quickie fight.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
An interesting enemy. Attack it two times, it grows. Attack it twice more, it
grows again. Two more attacks and there goes the bomb. Occassional 'bash' and
weak Fire magic can be shrugged off, and you can add many statuses onto poor
Bomb. If it manages to somehow suicide, girl hit won't be killed, but will
merely have HP reduced to 1. Secret? Have fire absorbing stuff equipped.

OSF is not much different, except that Fire now hits all girls, and it also
knows Fira. Then there's Double Attack - twice the charm, I guess, hehe. Only
stuff it loses is its 'bash'.

4. [Berserk] - on self - induces berserk and [increases STR by +1 level]
5. [Watera] - WATT VS one chr - water mgd
6. White Highwind - on all allies - recovers 37,5% of MAX HP, removes poison,
   silence, darkness, berserk, confuse, sleep
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Fungus corps - one of the species, whose latter representatives will be an
obstacle you'll itch to pass (specifically Mushroom Cloud). Anyway... Bully
Cap is the easiest of the bunch. All fungus fiends rely heavily on MP in RGF,
and it just so happens that Bully Cap has small MP amount. Steal it, then
confuse the little bastard - it is one of few fiends you can learn White Wind
from. As it is weak to fire, you should consider using that type of attacks.
Beware of Ebon Powder, which is used as a counter attack to girls' PATK.

In OSF things become more interesting. Ebon Powder is no longer counter
exclusivity, but can be used on any turn. Additionally Bully Cap gains ability
to cast fire magic, and it can also berserk itself once it has lost 75% of HP.
This berserk state is different though - it doesn't make Bully Cap attack
physically, but instead grants it the ability to cast Watera. Unfortunately
Bully Cap loses White Highwind in OSF state.

4. Strength Up - on self - [increases STR by +2 levels]
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Lupine fiend - you already know what to expect, right? Strength Up and
possibly a Killer Fang... you're lucky today - Major doesn't have Killer, but
Curse Fang instead. There's also an attack pattern too - 'bite' or Curse Fang
being used for two turns, followed by Strength Up (thus increasing damage
Major can do with its PATK. Although you can't darkness it, other statuses are
not a stranger to Major, so exploit them.

OSF is easier, but more annoying. For starters, it has lost its stupid
Strength Up and Curse Fang moves, but instead gained Quintuple Attack - this
move always hits, regardless of your protection and whatnot. Sequence can be
interrupted by your girls attacking Major and dealing damage to it, but it
won't cancel it completely (unless Major enters pyrefly-mode).

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
RGF - Extremely dangerous when with other fiends. Loves to use Seed Cannon,
which if girls aren't under protect, can KO a girl which has less that 50% MAX
HP at her disposal. Using fire attacks against this bastard is your quick
plant-be-gone solution.

OSF is even more annoying. Cepha loses Seed Cannon, but gains Heavy Seed
Cannon which reduces hit girl's HP to 1 (luckily protect can halve the
damage). MP Crush attack reduces girl's MP, so if you have jobs around which
rely on MP, they won't last long. As far as statuses go, stone it or make it
suffer with slow and stop statuses.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Funny chap, this dragon. 'Swipe', 'swipe', Tail Smash, repeat. Once you change
Claret's HP nine times, Flame Breath is used on first turn Claret gets
following that HP change. Oh, don't use anything element related VS Claret -
it absorbs everything. Also, beware of Tail Smash - get hit with it four times
and girls get KO-ed, if you don't heal in time.

Battling Claret in its OSF is not much different that RGF. It will start the
battle by charging three turns for Megaton Tail. Use the time you're given to
attack it mercilessly - leave no space for being slow. Megaton Tail will shave
off 62,5% of MAX HP when it hits, but damage can be reduced by protect. This
one cannot be darknessed, but attack can miss if your EVA is high enough. At
this point of the game it should be already. If during charge moves Claret
receives enough attacks, it will cancel its Megaton Tail attempt and prompt
it to use Crushing or Bruiser Tail. Like with RGF, it also absorbs all
elements in OSF.

Unlike RGF, Claret's actions in OSF cannot be predicted, which means that its
'swipe' and Flame Breath are a game of chance. Once again, though, high enough
EVA and Fire Eater PASA of your girls make these two attacks a breeze.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
RGF alternates between Blaster and lv1 element magic. Healing after each
Blaster should be your top priority, or you might soon find all of your girls
subdue to element magic it throws at you afterwards. Affect it with silence
and confusion - former shuts it up for good, and latter offers a chance for
you to learn White Wind.

OSF form is far more entertaining. As you whittle its HP down, its MAG will
increase - therefore do not dawdle for too long. Lv1 elements are gone,
instead it gains access to lv2 elements, targeted at all girls. Blaster is
still used, but not so often. If you try to protect this girls with POSSE,
don't bother - Coeurl knows Dispel. Even in OSF you can silence it,
effectively making this a victory move.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
A fiend representing most populated fiend species lupines. Fortunately, this
is the easiest example of Lupines in terms of being quickly KO-ed. It uses
four 'bite' four times in a row, and then Strength Up, which allows it to deal
higher damage with PATK.

OSF is easier, but more annoying. For starters, it has lost its stupid
Strength Up move, but instead gained Triple Attack - this move always hits,
regardless of your protection and whatnot. Sequence can be interrupted by your
girls attacking Coyote and dealing damage to it, but it won't cancel it
completely. As it has so little status immunities, knock yourself out and
choose appropriate means of disposing it.

The lowest of the low, Creeper is the easiest vermin to deal with. Having
water guarding acc equipped and decent EVA assures you won't get hit. When in
critical HP (below 66%) it may try to perform Hug Bomb, suicide move. Solution?
Kill it faster than it can kill itself.

In OSF Hug Bomb is lost, but the vermin has much more HP, and the ability to
use Waterga as well as launch Double Attack. Still, knowing that it can no
longer suicide on you, I consider this form easier, inspite of taking longer
to defeat.

setting up reflect to bounce spells back. That's not all - Bug can poison
girls and even haste itself.

In OSF, you have quite a battle at hand. Bio and Haste are lost, while Bug
retains elemental skills. It also gains wide array of [Ihatethisdressphere]
moves - it becomes angry at gun, sword and mage jobs. After certain [Hater]
move has been used six times, you'll experience [Payback] move, which carries
instant KO (if protected against it, phd will be inflicted). But you know
what's the funny thing? It can be affected with slow and stop, while
petrifying it takes care of it ultra fast.

up reflect - while you'll be doing so, Daeva will haste itself. Put some

go right back to its rightful owner. Mighty Guard, which is used on each sixth

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Like all elementals - rob it of all MP and it becomes a kitten. Unless it
steals the MP back, which is what it'll do for sure. Also, do not take this
fiend lightly - it can easily mess you up in many ways possible, esp by
Confuse. It is extremely resistant to both PATK and MATK, which is why it's
recommended that you use attacks which ignore DEF and MDEF stats. On each 3rd
turn it uses Magic Up, which increases damage it can do by MATK.

That is for RGF - but what about OSF? I consider it easier. It loses Confuse,
but gains Curaga and Regen. Set yourself up for the battle by casting Reflect
on both your girls and Element. Doing so ensures you'll be getting Regens
Element would otherwise cast on itself. Also no worries - Element's AI isn't
advanced enough to distinguish from who's under reflect - it'll always cast
Regen on itself. As for element magic bouncing back from you to it - it's
immune to element damage, ergo it won't gain anything. Each time Dark loses
20% of HP, its MAG stat will decrease, making its MATK less powerful. Effects
can be reversed by raising its HP, but why would you want to do that?

1. [Sharpened Needle] - VS one chr - phd, dmg slowly increases with each hit
2. 'Sting' - VS one chr - phd
3. Sleep Needle - VS one chr - phd, induces sleep
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
RGF battle is often a drag, for Dauber appears with other fiends and
inflicting itchy at the moment when it's not needed is quite annoying. Also
count in Sleep Needle and you have one annoyance victor - being guarded
against sleep and itchy is a good choice, as is simply having high EVA or
getting Dauber to suffer from darkness. If you wanna have a laugh, confuse it
and see what happens when fiends get inflicted with itchy. They won't be able
to move at all. Fear the power of spherechange!

OSF Dauber is easier - Sharpened Needle attack doesn't carry any negative
statuses, but it grows progressively stronger each time Dauber manages to land
a successful hit. Again high EVA or darkness on Dauber help rectify the
situation. Both RGF and OSF are susceptible to many NEGSE, so be sure to
exploit them to their fullest advantage.

6. [Lv3 element magic] - VS all chrs - respective type of mgd
7. Distortion Wave - NATT VS all chrs - mgd, arc attack
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
RGF knows only one attack - Distortion Wave, which hits all girls. I emplore
you to kill Deeps fast - if in pairs, they're exceptionally dangerous due to
high HP they have. Trying to berserk it will prompt it to use PATK, which are
far more manageable. It's weak to lightning, and as for statuses - employ slow
or stop.

OSF is easier by far. Deep starts by reflecting itself, then cycling thru
elemental magic, starting on lv1 and ending on lv3, then repeating. If you
count on simply reflecting all of your girls, think again. It knows Dispel and
it can destroy your effort rather easily. Having Auto-Reflect achieves exactly
the opposite - Deep will spend entire battle trying to dispel it -
unsuccessfully, of course.

6. [Firaga] - FATT VS one chr - fire mgd
7. [Quadruple Attack] - VS one chr - phd, attacks four times, always hits
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
An interesting enemy. Attack it two times, it grows. Attack it twice more, it
grows again. Two more attacks and there goes the bomb. Occassional 'bash' and
weak Fira magic can be shrugged off, and you can add many statuses onto poor
Detonator. If it manages to somehow suicide, girl hit won't be killed, but
will merely have HP reduced to 1. Secret? Have fire absorbing stuff equipped.

OSF is not much different, except that Fira now hits all girls, and it also
knows Firaga. Then there's Quadruple Attack - four times the charm, I guess,
hehe. It concentrates more on using fire magic than PATK, anyway. Only stuff
it loses is its 'bash'.

3. [Quintuple Attack] - VS one chr - phd, attacks five times, always hits
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
RGF has an attack pattern - three 'bite'-s, followed by La Nina, then repeat.
Make sure you defeat Dinictus before its 4th turn, else it'll really mess you
up with the damage La Nina does. Note that damage done by that attacks cannot
be reduced in any way. Tip: confuse or berserk it, and let me not forget stop.

OSF gains one new attack, called Quintuple Attack. Be glad when it decides to
use it, cos it means that you have five turns of nothing to worry about.
Dinictus no longer follows any distinctive attack pattern, meaning it can use
La Nina whenever it wants, so tread carefully. It now becomes immune to
confusion and berserk, but many other statuses can still be applied (like
stop).

RGF battle is a piece of cake. Only possessing simple 'peck' attack, it's the
easiest of bird fiends. But it does excel at EVA, making it hard to connect
for physical attacks - in this case you may want to consider using magic
instead?

OSF battle is a little more annoying, mainly cos of poison status Blight Wing
attacks induces. Divebeak also has improved EVA in this state - magic anyone?
Both RGF and OSF have absolutely no status immunity, so lots of status changes
can be abused, mainly darkness and sleep.

7. Ochu Dance - VS all chrs - induces sleep and causes MP damage, arc attack
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Plants. I hate 'em. Especially Ochus. Be swift, be fiery and strike without
mercy. As it is weak against fire, consider fire attacks. Make sure you're
protected against itchy, else you'll constantly be switching DSP. Then there's
its Dance, which puts all girls to sleep and causes MP damage In RGF this is
all it knows... Put it to sleep yourself, hehe.

But in OSF things get out of hand really quick. For starters, 'bash' can no
longer inflict status changes, but other attacks can. Confusion protection is
still quite a must (thanks to Ochu Jiggle), and in case girl gets berserked,
so much better - at least she hits the designated target. Consider reflect to
be used to bounce occasional lightning spells back to its owner. Last thing to
mention is that once Ochu is close to defeat (75% HP smoked off), it likes to
haste itself - so hurry up and kill it quickly. Both forms show wide status
immunity, but it isn't immune to KO or eject.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Slow and heavy. If your EVA is decent, all of its 'headbutts' will miss.
RGF Worm will use 'headbutt' until it successfully deals damage four times,
and then prepare a charge turn for Earthquake - beware, this attack delays
your girls a bit. If you'd like to evade it, set berserk on Worm.
If Worm is OSF and loses 66% of its HP, it will use Sorrow on first turn it
gets. You don't have to really worry about Sorrow, as it can't kill you. As
long as you can keep up HP lost, there's almost no way you could lose this
battle.

7. [Mage Payback] - VS one chr - phd, attacks white/black mages, induces KO
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
RGF, even with some preparation, is very annoying. Strongest of all drakes,
it's spelled death on its forehead. When its HP is high enough, all you'll be
seeing is Elder's 'bash' - but attack it with MATK and doom is upon you.
Pyroplexy, dubbed flame elemental attack, is so much more than that. It packs
non-elemental attributes and will get you killed. High MDEF and shell are a
must. Status-wise, Elder resists lots of stuff (but not eject), and it has a
weakness to four primary elements. Force of Nature acc is the king in dealing
damage - throw berserker in the mix as well. One more annoying stuff to
mention is innate Auto-Protect Elder is carrying around, which makes it for a
long and gruesome battle.

In OSF all drake fiends follow analogy, similar to elemental fiends. Lower
drake's HP gets, lower its strength gets. On the other hand, all drake fiends
are capable of restoring HP with curative magic (set reflect on them to get
the curing instead). When OSF, Elder becomes bad news for mages. Prepare for
Mage-Hater attack - once it's been used six times, Mage Payback follows -
unless protected against KO, girl goes sayonara. Try using jobs other than
black or white mage. Elder retains Auto-Protect in this state as well.

sayonara to it. You want to steal its MP too? Go ahead, but this guy has

Curse, 'swipe', Stone Breath, repeat. Don't get hit too often, as 'swipe'
lessens attributes and induces berserk and poison. Stoneproof should be a
standard protection by now, but I don't get it why Curse would be a good

RGF is a piece of cake. Thundara? You simply whip on Lightningproof or better

puniest fiend ever (reducing its MP to zero will achieve same effect).
Recommended element in this battle is water, to which Amarillo is weak
against. PATK are not as strong as they could be, but mainly cos of flan
species' trait of having high DEF. Still, you're more than welcome to knock it
around with PATK.

Tide of battle becomes more interesting in OSF. Each time Amarillo loses 20%
of HP, its MAG stat will grow, making its MATK even more powerful. Effects can
be reversed by raising its HP, but why would you want to do that? Shutting it
up is quite easy - silence it. Draining its MP will not work, cos all OSF
fiends have Spellspring ability, remember?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
RGF is quite challenging. Azabache frequently drains girls' HP, poisons them
and resists all elements, not to mention it's extremely versatile against
PATK. For these reasons you may want to use attacks with special properties -
dark knight's Darkness, gun mage's 1000 Needles, Annihilator, Mortar or Storm
Cannon, attack items from your stock and more. There's much options, you
merely need to seek them out.

Tide of battle becomes more interesting in OSF. It gains access to all four
lv3 element magics. Each time Azabache loses 20% of HP, its MAG stat will
grow, making its MATK even more powerful. Effects can be reversed by raising
its HP, but why would you want to do that? Draining its MP will not work, cos
all OSF fiends have Spellspring ability, remember? Azabache has a neat trick
up its sleeve in OSF - to ensure it gets Magic Up bonuses, it will cast Bio on
itself to get poison status. You can tamper with its AI easily in this case -
have Poisonproof on and then cast Reflect on Azabache. It'll spend whole
battle casting on Bio and failing miserably.

1. <'Bite'> - VS one chr - phd, induces poison (OSF)
2. [Desperate Strike] - STATTP VS one chr - universal phd, formula [reptile's

3. Poison Fang - VS one chr - phd, induces poison
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Second smallest of reptile fiends, but just as annoying, esp with its Poison
Fang. Entering battles against reptiles is recommended with Star Pendants
equipped - or reducing the chances of attack connecting by inflicting darkness
on Gecko, not to mention there's a slew of other statuses you can help
yourself with. Superior EVA is also recommended.

In OSF form Gecko loses Poison Fang, but its 'bite' gains the bonus of adding
poison on girl attacked. In addition, whatever damage you inflicted so far,
will be returned to the girl attacked with Desperate Strike. In this case,
maximum damage you can expect to receive is 3640 damage (back attack bonus,
critical bonus). So if you wanna live, have all three gals concentrate their
attacks at Gecko in one swift combo. There's no way it can possibly survive
that. Or in more proffesional way - stone it. That way we'll see just how
desperate it really is, hehe.

7. Skullcracker - FRATTP VS one chr - fractional phd, tears off 62,5% MAX HP
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Another tank fiend you'll encounter. Packing high DEF, you will have trouble
dealing high damage to this joker, so chain attacks are recommended. Let's not
forget magic attacks. You can darkness this fiend to reduce its ACCU. Gemini
alternates between 'sword smash' and Skullcracker (former has delay
properties). Heal immediately after Skull was used. One more such attack and
girl is a goner.

OSF loses Skull, but Gemini is now able to cast lv3 elements, along with
ability to cure itself and dispel POSSE you put on your girls. Don't flash
white mages in this battle for too long. Gemini is very tired of them and will
focus most of its attacks on that poor white mage. It does forfeit casting its
magics, but losing a girl cos of that doesn't cut it.

4. [Secret Hero Drink] - on self - induces invincibility
5. 'Counter-punch' - VS one chr - phd, will raise its hands as a sign to
   counter any physical attacks
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
This guy is fairly interesting - in RGF all it knows is simple PATK. However,
once its HP is reduced below 75%, it'll put up its dukes. At the same time
Gigas gains [DEF up +10] bonus, making girls' physicals less effective.
Luckily the effect can be cleared off by samurai's Fingresnap. If this is not
an option, then consider using MATK, esp gravity based. Gigas is susceptible
to lot of status changes, most notably petrification and poison. It can also
be slowed.

In OSF things get much more hectic. It no longer uses PATK (except Futile, but
I'll cover that later), instead it knows lv3 element magic of four primary
elements - and it hits all gals! Set up reflect to bounce it back. Once Gigas
loses 50% of HP, it'll make itself invincible. Nothing you can do now to
damage it - but it is still susceptible to statuses. Go for KO! Once Gigas
lingers around with less than 90% of HP, expect to see Futile Resistance,
rather dangerous damage and status dealing attack.

4. [Regen] - on self - induces regen
5. <Osmose> - VS one chr - MP stolen is added to Gold's MP
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Like all elementals - rob it of all MP and it becomes a kitten. Unless it
steals the MP back, which is what it'll do for sure. Sporting very high
resistance to PATK, using water magic is the way to go. On each 3rd turn it
uses Magic Up, which increases damage it can do by MATK. Silence on Gold is
effective way of not being worried ever. Lightningproof or better will ensure
you take no damage from its magic.

That is for RGF - but what about OSF? It gains Regen, so set yourself up for
the battle by casting Reflect on Element. Doing so ensures you'll be getting
Regens Element would otherwise cast on itself. Also no worries - Element's AI
isn't advanced enough to distinguish from who's under reflect - it'll always
cast Regen on itself. Each time Gold loses 20% of HP, its MAG stat will
decrease, making its MATK less powerful. Effects can be reversed by raising
its HP, but why would you want to do that?

Haunt will take care of, you can easily inflict superior damage and send it
back where it came from. For having such high HP and judging by its size I

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
One of the fiends you'll love or hate - usually begins the battle with Really
Bad Breath, which can seriously mess you up if you're not packing Ribbons.
Hello confusion, goodbye girls - game over. To avoid this unfortunate event,
perhaps consider using dark knight for many anti-status PASA she offers. When
GreatM is low on health, you'll be seeing Staccato a lot. Don't take too long
in killing it, or else GreatM's 'squirt' and Staccato attacks will reduce your
core stats by too much.

In case GreatM is OSF, your item stock becomes possible target area. Malboro
gains the ability to destroy your Eye Drops, Antidotes, Echo Screens, Holy
Waters and Remedies in a flash. In addition, its Halitosis will force you to
constantly switch DSP (equip Favorite Outfit to be Itchproof), possibly making
you forget to lead the battle at hand. Do not allow that - GreatM may only be
a slightly harder. Okay, so you may no longer predict when Really Bad Breath
will be used, but hey, where'd the challenge be then?

'Chomp' inflicts huge damage, so protect being in place is a wise decision.
BTW, you cannot evade it, for it always hits. Don't worry about your item
stock, though - all of the items that can get possibly destroyed can easily be
bought later. GreatM is still susceptible to all seven status breaks.

6. [Sword-Hater] - VS one chr - phd, attacks samurais/dark knights/warriors
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
RGF, with some preparation, isn't annoying. When its HP is high enough, all
you'll be seeing is Greater's 'bash' - but bring it's HP under 75% and it'll
start using 'firebreath'. Greater unfortunately can't be darknessed, but you
can apply protect to reduce the damage taken. As for fire attacks, equip stuff
that guards against fire.

In OSF all drake fiends follow analogy, similar to elemental fiends. Lower
drake's HP gets, lower its strength gets. On the other hand, all drake fiends
are capable of restoring HP with curative magic (set reflect on them to get
the curing instead). When OSF, Greater's 'bash' has an added bonus of inducing
poison. Furthermore, sword girls will be continuously pelted by Sword-Hater -
either apply protect or use jobs that don't require swords. Petrifying Greater
works amazingly, too.

4. <Halting Gaze> - NATT VS one chr - mgd, induces stop
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
RGF - not-so-easy. Halting gaze does small mgd and inflicts stop sometimes.
That's not all - it also knows Pointless attack (no EXP and AP are gained) and
Supersonic Waves (mgd and poison status).

OSF - semi-hard. Besides Halting and Waves it also gained the ability to cast
lv3 elements, making it more versatile in dishing out mgd. Its HP is also
improved, but status immunity leaves much to desire for.

6. Heaven's Cataract - NATT VS all chrs - mgd, reduces [DEF, MDEF, ACCU, EVA &
   LUCK by -1 level], arc attack
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Second of basilisk fiends you'll run into, and semi-hard. For the RGF I advise
you right off the bat to have Stoneproof handy. Or Softs when the going gets
tough - although not having to worry about being petrified in the first place
is better choice. Then we have Heaven's Cat - aside from mgd it lessens five
attributes (luckily not STR or MAG). And then here's the attack pattern - four
'bash', Stony Glare, four 'bash', Heaven's Cat, repeat. Darkness it to cause
Gucumatz to miss often with its PATK. Applying shell will take care of halving
damage Heaven's Cat does.

OSF battle for a change of pace, you say? Heaven's Cat is lost, but more other
attacks are gained: MP Break destroys girls' MP, Destroy Soft will rid you of
Softs one by one... and Hunter's Gaze? People with Ultimania guides say that
Hunter's Gaze merely points out who will Gucumatz attack in next turn.
Darkness and stop statuses are the most recommended NEGSE for Gucumatz.

4. [Secret Dark Matter] - STATT VS all chrs - around 1500 universal dmg
5. 'Counter-punch' - VS one chr - phd, will raise its hands as a sign to
   counter any physical attacks
6. 'Double-punch' - VS one chr - phd
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
One big punching bag, who thinks your girls are punching bags. There's a neat
trick involving Gug - as soon as battle starts, you'll see its hands lowered
for about 1 second before it raises them. Try to kill it or at least damage it
during lowered-hands state, as this is the time its DEF hasn't gained any
boost yet. As soon as Gug raises its hands, its DEF is raised by +10 levels,
making further PATK less effective. A quick way to get rid of it is to petrify
it - or using samurai's Fingersnap.

In OSF things get much more hectic. It no longer uses PATK, instead it knows
lv3 element magic of four primary elements - and it hits all gals! Let's not
forget Flare. Set up reflect to bounce all that stuff back. Once Gug loses 80%
of HP, it'll use Dark Matter against YRP. You must have over 1500 HP to
survive.

8. Absorb - VS one chr - HP&MP stolen are added to Haizhe's HP&MP
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
RGF knows few attacks - it will use 'smash' four times, and then follow with
Absorb - attack pattern then repeats. I needn't mention that Haizhe and Deep
Haizhe combo is very dangerous. Both have quite high HP at the point of the
game you're meeting them. Fortunately Haizhe can be confused. In this state,
you may be the lucky winner to learn Mighty Guard. It's weak to lightning, and
as for statuses - employ slow or stop.

OSF is easier by far. Haizhe starts by reflecting itself, then cycling thru
elemental magic, starting on lv1 and ending on lv3, then repeating. If you
count on simply reflecting all of your girls, think again. It knows Dispel and
it can destroy your effort rather easily. Having Auto-Reflect achieves exactly
the opposite - Haizhe will spend entire battle trying to dispel it -
unsuccessfully, of course.

In OSF Hug Bomb is lost, but the vermin has much more HP, and the ability to

also be slowed or even stopped.

In OSF things get much more lively. It no longer uses PATK, instead it knows
lv2 element magic of four primary elements - and it hits all gals! Set up
reflect to bounce it back. But before the battle really begins, it'll use
Stamina Tonic and Hi-Potions on itself to bolster its HP. Once that's out of

In OSF, you have quite a battle at hand. Slow and Sleep are lost, while Bug
retains elemental skills. It also gains wide array of [Ilovethisgirl] moves -

One of the first tank fiends you'll encounter. Packing high DEF, you will have
trouble dealing high damage to this joker, so chain attacks are recommended.
Let's not forget magic attacks. You can darkness this fiend to reduce its
ACCU. Once Iron Giant loses 75% HP, you'll be introduced to Reaper attack. Now
Giant follows attack pattern of two 'sword smash'-es, then Reaper, then
repeat. Beware, 'sword smash' has delay properties.

OSF loses Reaper, but Giant is now able to cast lv2 elements, along with
ability to cure itself and dispel POSSE you put on your girls. Don't flash
white mages in this battle for too long. Giant is very tired of them and will
focus most of its attacks on that poor white mage. It does forfeit casting its
magics, but losing a girl cos of that doesn't cut it.

3. [Reflect] - on self - induces reflect

8. [Ultima] - NATT VS all chrs - mgd
9. <Body Splash> - FRATTP VS one chr - fractional phd, tears off 62,5% MAX HP
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
A thick headed bastard, extremely resilient to all types of attacks. Attack
pattern - 'smash', Body Splash, three 'smash'-es, Storm Cannon, repeat. Take
haste to heal after each hit - don't bother attacking Ironside until after it
opens its chestplate, revealing its weak spot. At this time unload everything
you have, but make sure your HP is above 1150 (half less if you're shelled).
Eject, as usually, is one status fiend isn't immune against.

OSF is more formiddable. First it'll reflect itself, then start cycling thru
lv1, lv2 and lv3 elements, finishing the cycle with Ultima. After Ultima the
cycle begins anew. If you throw any POSSE onto your girls, they'll be
dispeled. If you dispel Ironside's reflect, it will counter that action by
using 'smash' once, followed by Storm Cannon.

3. Strength Up - on self - [increases STR by +2 levels]
4. Killer Fang - VS one chr - induces KO
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Lupine fiend - you already know what to expect, right? Strength Up and
possibly a Killer Fang... you're lucky today, for Hound is the winner you've
been looking for. Angel Earrings, Safety Bit or mastered dark knight (although
it's very hard you have the latter at this point of the game) ensure girls
won't subdue to Killer Fang. There's also an attack pattern too - 'bite' or
Killer Fang being used for three turns, followed by Strength Up (thus
increasing damage Major can do with its PATK. Darkness it as well to raise
your survival chances. If they appear in packs and your girls are fairly weak,
fleeing may be better option than getting slaughtered.

OSF is easier, but more annoying. For starters, it has lost its stupid
Strength Up and Killer Fang moves, but instead gained Quadruple Attack - this
move always hits, regardless of your protection and whatnot. Sequence can be
interrupted by your girls attacking Hound and dealing damage to it, but it
won't cancel it completely (unless Hound enters pyrefly-mode).

effect. Almost all machinas rely solely on STR, so having good DEF and decent
EVA is a general setup for these bastards. This machina can stop your girls,
so extra caution in form of Dragonfly Orb is welcome.

6. [Rip to Shreds] - VS one chr - phd, induces itchy
7. [Blind] - VS one chr - induces darkness
8. [Silence] - VS one chr - induces silence
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
King Takouba of the blades will make your battles against it quite frantic.
Unless you have Poisonproof tucked away somewhere, you'll spend most of the
time curing poison status its regular PATK carries. Blade Rondo, used on each
fourth turn, is very strong and always hits. To reduce damage you'll be
taking, consider using Power Break on King. It has become immune to both slow
and stop, but luckily fire attacks are still its weakness.

OSF - You hit it, but it hits back. Heh, Frenzied Edge is the name of the move
that will make your hair grow white pretty soon. Each time King takes damage
will be each time King counters - and if you're hit four times without healing
inbetween... there goes the KO, for Edge belongs to fractional type attacks.
Blade Rondo is used as 8th move, regardless of past actions it took. There's
still more - King gained the ability to cast a handful of status magics,
Confuse being the most annoying one. There's also Rip to Shreds attack, which
induces itchy status, forcing you to spherechange (if no Remedies or Esunas
are present). Be afraid of Confuse and make absolutely sure you can guard
against this status.

4. [MP Break] - VS one chr - causes MP damage
5. <Stony Glare> - VS one chr - induces petrify
6. Heaven's Cataract - NATT VS all chrs - mgd, reduces [DEF, MDEF, ACCU, EVA &
   LUCK by -1 level], arc attack
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
First of basilisk fiends you'll run into, and semi-hard. For the RGF I advise
you right off the bat to have Stoneproof handy. Or Softs when the going gets
tough - although not having to worry about being petrified in the first place
is better choice. Then we have Heaven's Cat - aside from mgd it lessens five
attributes (luckily not STR or MAG). And then here's the attack pattern -
Stony Glare, two 'bash', Heaven's Cat, two 'bash', repeat. Darkness it to
cause Kukulcan to miss often with its PATK. Applying shell will take care of
halving damage Heaven's Cat does.

OSF battle for a change of pace, you say? Heaven's Cat is lost, but more other
attacks are gained: MP Break destroys girls' MP, Destroy Soft will rid you of
Softs one by one... and Hunter's Gaze? People with Ultimania guides say that
Hunter's Gaze merely points out who will Kukulcan attack in next turn.
Darkness and stop statuses are the most recommended NEGSE for Kukulcan.

1. <Rend> - FRATTP VS one chr - fractional phd, tears off 25% MAX HP or 50%

2. [Desperate Strike] - STATTP VS one chr - universal phd, formula [reptile's
   MAX HP - current HP = damage], sometimes used as counter
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Largest of reptile fiends, it shows just what it is made of. Sporting speed,
evasion and accuracy, it is not to be messed with. Rend attack will make you
pull your hair out, cos it deals damage based on MAX HP - yep, you're right,
it's a fractional type attack. Superior EVA is also recommended (songstress
Matador's Song).

In OSF form Lacerta grows more powerful still. Rend now tears 50% MAX HP,
making you wish to end the battle even faster than before. Protect status and
Matador's Song will be immensely helpful, esp if you run into three Lacertas
at once. In addition, whatever damage you inflicted so far, will be returned
to the girl attacked with Desperate Strike. In this case, maximum damage you
can expect to receive is 54220 damage (back attack bonus, critical bonus).
Holy ****! And that's a lot of statuses Lacerta's immune to - luckily it shows
no immunity to being ejected, hehe.

Easy. Decent EVA will assure you're not even hit and he can be affected with
every status in the book. Don't be afraid of physical attacks this enemy uses,
for they aren't very strong.

4. [Strength Up] - STR power increases as this fiend's HP rises for each 20%

5. [Strength Down] - on self - STR power decreases as this fiend's HP drops by
   each 20% you shave off
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
RGF, with some preparation, isn't annoying. Its attacl pattern cannot be
deciphered - it'll alternate between few round of breathing at you or charging
you. I don't understand why it has immunity to silence... anyway, apply sleep
or darkness to have easy time dealing with this drake.

In OSF all drake fiends follow analogy, similar to elemental fiends. Lower
drake's HP gets, lower its strength gets. On the other hand, all drake fiends
are capable of restoring HP with curative magic (set reflect on them to get
the curing instead). Extra immunity to berserk and confuse shouldn't cause you
too much trouble, right? Especially since other bad statuses work.

2. <'Seed Burst'> - VS one chr - phd, 8 hits
3. [MP Crush] - VS one chr - causes MP damage, 8 hits
4. [Heavy Seed Cannon] - FRATTP VS one chr - universal phd, reduces HP to 1
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
RGF - Extremely dangerous when with other fiends. Loves to use Seed Cannon,
which if girls aren't under protect, can KO a girl which has less that 50% MAX
HP at her disposal. Using fire attacks against this bastard is your quick
plant-be-gone solution.

OSF is even more annoying. Leuco loses Seed Cannon, but gains Heavy Seed
Cannon which reduces hit girl's HP to 1 (luckily protect can halve the
damage). MP Crush attack reduces girl's MP, so if you have jobs around which
rely on MP, they won't last long. As far as statuses go, stone it or make it
suffer with slow and stop statuses.

First turn is wasted for dooming one girl - but still allowing you enough time
to send it back where it came from. After Lich uses Doom, it will use magic of
the element it absorbs four times, then again Doom, and repeat. Gravity and
holy properties are always the same, but other four vary (hence the stars
below those properties).

4. Strength Up - on self - [increases STR by +2 levels]
5. Killer Fang - VS one chr - induces KO
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Lupine fiend - you already know what to expect, right? Strength Up and
possibly a Killer Fang... you're lucky today, for Lupus is another winner
you've been looking for. Where are your Angel Earrings and Safety Bit acc? You
have to make sure girls won't subdue to Killer Fang. There's also an attack
pattern too - 'bite' or Killer Fang being used for two turns, followed by
Strength Up (thus increasing damage Major can do with its PATK (beware, it
also carries confusion, which can totally destroy you). Darkness it as well to
raise your survival chances. If they appear in packs and your girls are fairly
weak, fleeing may be better option than getting slaughtered.

OSF is easier, but more annoying. For starters, it has lost its stupid
Strength Up and Killer Fang moves, as well as confusion bonus 'bite' carries.
Instead it gained Quintuple Attack and 1000-Gil-Gnasher - former move always
hits, regardless of your protection and whatnot, while later checks YRP's
pockets to see how much cash they carry (naughty Lupus!). Quintuple Attack's
sequence can be interrupted by your girls attacking Lupus and dealing damage
to it, but it won't cancel it completely (unless Lupus enters pyrefly-mode).

As miniboss, Miss E. proves much tougher than the battle you otherwise have in
CH2. Still, we're in CH5 and equipment's a plenty. You should have couple of
Ribbons already (Bribe OSF Flailing Ochus in Zanarkand), which successfully
takes care of like half her attacks. She can no longer be put to sleep. If
you're gonna try adding POSSE on your girls, be aware that she knows Dispel,
and can thus nullify your efforts rather easily. In case she pulls off Mighty
Guard, dispel it. Her HP is not so high anyway to be much of a challenge.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Awww, ain't it cute? YRP dies of short death... HEY!!! Unlike its small bro,
Mega is verrry dangerous. Chef's Knife does a little over 2000 damage at max
DEF and protect. This isn't funny! Unfortunately, high DEF and protect will be
needed if you wanna survive (well, if you have Cat Nip, use that then).

OSF battle, then. Chef's Knife terror is still around, and it also gained
Firaga and Flare. Its most dangerous skill is Cry, which is used once Mega
loses 75% HP. After being struck 15 times, Mega will use Karma against girl
who last attacked it. Either girl becomes stoned, or she suffers confusion if
Stoneproofed. If you go for confusion, heal her ASAP, for you don't want your
team accidentally wiped out.

Few steps higher than the Tomb, Monolith awaits its appraisal. By being KO-ed,
of course. Monolith has an attack pattern: Demi, 'swipe', Demi, 'swipe', Stone
Breath, then repeat the sequence. 'Swipe' can be quite helpful, as girl
becomes berserk and will take care of the fact who to attack all by herself.
Needless to say, have Stoneproof.

   petrify, [reduces STR & MAG by -10 levels]
4. [Berserk] - on self - induces berserk and [increases STR by +1 level]
5. <Ultima> - NATT VS all chrs - mgd
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Second in command in fungus corps, but the most dangerous bastard of them all.
Pernicious Powder is one of the most devastating moves in the game - aside
from causing girls to catch all sorts of bad statuses, STR and MAG are
seriously bogged down. Ribbon is a must - even so, you'll constantly have to
change DSP, cos of itchy status, which is induced regardless of protection.
Don't bother draining Cloud's MP, as it has Spellspring - infinite Ultimas on
YRP. You must strike decisively and with your strongest attacks. If you cannot
be bothered, then your better choice is to escape. As it is weak to fire, you
should consider using that type of attacks.

In OSF things become more interesting. Waterga and Firaga have joined the
bunch and Ultima is not used so often. Cap off 75% of its HP and it'll berserk
itself. Now the only attack used will be Ultima. At least no more Pernicious
Powder - but is that good enough of a consolation?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Fungus corps - one of the species, whose latter representatives will be an
obstacle you'll itch to pass (specifically Mushroom Cloud). Anyway...
Mycotoxin doesn't have any elemental magic to be throwing around in RGF, but
instead only uses Nausea Powder. Atchoo! Star Pendants, where are you? Just
bust a cap in its ass and it's defeated - faster disposal can be achieved by
using fire attacks. You can also confuse the little bastard - it is one of few
fiends you can learn White Wind from.

In OSF things become more interesting. Besides Nausea Powder is has access to
water and fire magic. Reflect, anyone? It can also berserk itself once it has
lost 75% of HP. This berserk state is different though - it doesn't make
Mycotoxin attack physically but instead grants it the ability to cast Waterga.
Unfortunately Mycotoxin loses White Highwind in OSF state.

4. [Thunder] - LATT VS one chr - light mgd
5. [Touch-and-Go] - VS one chr - phd, induces berserk
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Plants. I hate 'em. Especially Ochus. Be swift, be fiery and strike without
mercy. As it is weak against fire, consider fire attacks. Make sure you're
protected against poison and confusion (esp the latter can really mess you
up). In RGF this is all it knows...

But in OSF things get out of hand really quick. For starters, 'bash' can no
longer inflict status changes, but other attacks can. Confusion protection is
still quite a must (thanks to Ochu Jiggle), and in case girl gets berserked,
so much better - at least she hits the designated target. Consider reflect to
be used to bounce occasional lightning spells back to its owner. Last thing to
mention is that once Ochu is close to defeat (loses more than 75% HP), it
likes to haste itself - so hurry up and kill it quickly. Both forms show wide
status immunity, but it isn't immune to KO or eject.

6. [Dispel] - VS all chrs - shatters most POSSE
7. ['Copycat move'] - OSF Omega responds to following attacks by using the
   move you used against it unless specified otherwise - any black magic; uses
   Flare as counter to any white magic except Holy and Dispel; all Arcanas
   except Black Sky; Supernova and MP Absorb
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
How lucky do you think you are? Judgment and Punishment aren't to be scared
of, provided you have decent MDEF. Omega's 'punch' is the lucky part - will
the girl hit receive itchy, poison or confusion status? In worst case she may
get KO-ed - nothing you can do to prevent that, except reviving her.
Unfortunately there is also no way to predict when Judgment or Punishment will
be used.

OSF is more challenging. Besides Judgment and Punishment, it has also gained
Flare, Osmose, Dispel and ability to copy your moves. Therefore be careful of
what you use against Omega. Its punch now deals only phd with no statuses
attached to it. As battle starts, you'll notice Omega just sits there, doing
nothing. Don't let it fool you - as soon as you make a move against it, it'll
counter. You should consider using your most powerful attacks - don't attack
Omega while it's in moving motion, or else your combos won't register.
Sometimes Omega will act on its own and use one of many attacks it has.
Temporary POSSE are a waste of time, as they'll simply get dispeled.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
RGF battle is still a piece of cake - only difference from Divebeak is that
Peregrine can cause MP damage with Mind Pecker. It also excels at EVA, making
it hard to connect for physical attacks - in this case you may want to
consider using magic instead? Peregrine has no fixed attack pattern.

In OSF battle Peregrine loses Mind Pecker, but gains Blight and Silent Wings,
making it extra hard for your mages to chuck magic in its direction. Still,
this is nothing you couldn't possibly cure with Echo Screen or Antidotes. As
Peregrine has improved EVA in this state, option to use magic is even more
alluring. Both RGF and OSF have absolutely no status immunity, so lots of
status changes can be abused, mainly darkness and sleep.

EVA is a general setup for these bastards. This machina can darkness and
silence your girls, as well as put them to sleep, so extra caution in form of

don't joke with Pop Fry too long. Kick its metallic ass and move on.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Stars you see in elemental section denote that element weaknesses will change
during battle, depending on actions you take. You have an extremely hard task
at hand here. Gel doesn't use any element magic at all in RGF, meaning you'll
have to rely on Scan of your gun mages. If girl gets 'bash'-ed, heal her
immediately, for if she takes another hit, she goes KO. If you can't be
bothered by scanning, use holy attacks instead or nonelemental attacks. If
bastard takes HP or MP damage in RGF, it will use Barrier Shift, which will
change its elemental affinities. Shift can be used even without you ever
attacking it - it does so to make sure you're always on your toes.

OSF - 'bash' properties are retained, but Barrier Shift is lost. Gel will,
each time it takes HP or MP damage, change one of element attributes - either
it will become immune to one or will disable already activated immunity.
Furthermore it can now pelt you with lv3 element magic.

4. [Brute Force] - VS one chr - heavy phd

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
OSF - Proto possesses following attack pattern, 'punch', 'punch', Absorb,
'punch', 'punch', Thundara. Which attack it will begin with, that is
impossible to determine. Now that you know its attack pattern, you should be
well prepared for the upcoming onslaught. If Proto proves to be too fast for
you, slow it down - or stop it completely. Have Poisonproof tucked away to
avoid being poisoned by its PATK.

RGF - its attack pattern becomes irregular and you can no longer predict what
will be used in next turn. Proto loses Absorb, and its Thundara now hits all
girls. Real fun begins once Proto loses 66% of HP - on first turn it gets it
will berserk itself and lose all of the abilities. Instead it gains Brute
Force, a beefed up version of 'punch' - it inflicts moderate damage and always
strikes critical.

RGF - this plant fiend luckily doesn't have Seed Cannon type attacks like its
bigger brethren, but it still proves to be a pest. Using fire attacks against
this bastard is your quick plant-be-gone solution.

OSF is somewhat annoying, cos Purpurea gains MP Crush, an attack which reduces
girl's MP, so if you have jobs around which rely on MP, they won't last long.

1. <Death Blast> - VS one chr - inflicts KO; if girl resists KO, her HP is
   reduced to 1 instead
2. <Lv3 element magic> - VS one chr(RGF)/all chrs(OSF)- respective type of mgd
3. [Magic Up] - MAG power increases as this fiend's HP decreases for each 20%
   you shave off
4. [Magic Down] - MAG power decreases as this fiend's HP increases for each
   20% it recovers
5. [Dispel] - VS all chrs - shatters most POSSE
6. White Highwind - on all allies - recovers 37,5% of MAX HP, removes poison,
   silence, darkness, berserk, confuse, sleep
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
She might prove to be quite a tough cookie. She alternates between Death Blast
and lv3 element magic. Unless girls are wearing Deathproof, they'll get KO-ed.
I would suggest buying Angel Earrings in Guadosalam. To take care of element
magic, have songstress perform Samba of Silence. Confusion is another saviour
- silence shuts it up for good, and latter offers a chance for you to learn
White Wind.

OSF form is far more entertaining. As you whittle its HP down, its MAG will
increase - therefore do not dawdle for too long. Lv3 elements are no longer
targeted as single, but all girls instead. Blast is still used, but not so
often. If you try to protect this girls with POSSE, don't bother - Coeurl
knows Dispel. Even in OSF you can silence it, effectively making this a
victory move.

1. <Fire> - FATT VS all chrs - fire mgd

3. [Magic Down] - on self - MAG power decreases as this fiend's HP drops by
   each 20% you shave off
4. Osmose - VS one chr - MP stolen is added to Red's MP
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Like all elementals - rob it of all MP and it becomes a kitten. Unless it
steals the MP back, which is what it'll do for sure. Sporting very high
resistance to PATK, using ice magic is the way to go. On each 3rd turn it uses
Magic Up, which increases damage it can do by MATK. Silence on Red is
effective way of not being worried ever. Fireproof or better will ensure you
take no damage from its magic.

That is for RGF - but what about OSF? It gains nothing new, only thing worth
mentioning is that each time Red loses 20% of HP, its MAG stat will decrease,
making its MATK less powerful. Effects can be reversed by raising its HP, but
why would you want to do that?

5. <Chaos Flame> - FATT VS one chr - fire mgd
6. <Aqua Breath> - WATT VS all chrs - water mgd, arc attack
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
OSF - attack pattern is Aqua Breath, Chaos Flame, Thundaga and 'punch'. Which
attack it will begin with, that is impossible to determine. Now that you know
its attack pattern, you should be well prepared for the upcoming onslaught. If
Rhyos proves to be too fast for you, slow it down. None of element attacks
prove to be too useful as well.

RGF - its attack pattern becomes irregular and you can no longer predict what
will be used in next turn. Rhyos retains all of the same attacks as in RGF,
with the exception of its 'punch' sometimes reducing hit girl's HP to 1. Real
fun begins once Rhyos loses 66% of HP - on first turn it gets it will berserk
itself and lose all of the abilities. Instead it gains Brute Force, a beefed
up version of 'punch' - it inflicts moderate damage and always strikes
critical.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Zu's bigger brother. Even more HP than Zu, you're in for a lengthy battle. In
RGF you'll be hit by 'bash' and Sonic Storm, with latter being used on each
6th turn Rukh gets. You MUST have Stoneproof, or else Rukh's bash will petrify
you! Also apply protect to survive longer. Rukh's danger level is also
bolstered by the fact that is immune to any magic and against most bad
statuses (eject, here we come!).

OSF is quite an obnoxious one as well. Rukh begins with Chicken Wing, which
can KO your whole team, if bird is lucky enough to gain critical strike on all
girls. Chicken will be followed by Hi-Potion Vortex, crappy attack which wipes
5 Phoenix Downs out of your inventory - is 2500 gil really that much to lose?
Sonic Boom is used afterwards, and then 'bash' forever and ever. Please note
that Rukh can no longer petrify you by its 'bash'.

hit (also possible in OSF). But hey, it only has 60 HP, making that matter to
be laughed at.

In OSF Sahagin is also able to use Scum Spray, moderately annoying move that
carries darkness. In that case switch to using lightning magic. As for
statuses, there's nothing Sahagin is immune to except when in OSF, but that's
nothing to write home about.

Slow and heavy. If your EVA is decent, all of its 'headbutts' will miss.
RGF Worm will use 'headbutt' until it successfully deals damage four times,

your girls a bit. If you'd like to evade it, set berserk on Worm.

Demi and Slurp. Demi can't kill you, but Slurp can (used very frequently on

2. <'Bite'> - VS one chr - phd, induces confusion (OSF) and slow (OSF)
3. [Desperate Strike] - STATTP VS one chr - universal phd, formula [reptile's
   MAX HP - current HP = damage], sometimes used as counter
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Quite the oddball, this chappy. In its regular form, it ain't dangerous, for
it only sports your usual Poison Fang and 'bite' attacks. For former equip
Star Pendants or other acc that guard against poison, and the latter can be
shrugged off by protect.

In OSF form Skink loses Poison Fang, but its 'bite' gains the bonus of adding
confusion and slow on girl attacked - cure confusion immediately! In addition,
whatever damage you inflicted so far, will be returned to the girl attacked
with Desperate Strike. In this case, maximum damage you can expect to receive
is 3640 damage (back attack bonus, critical bonus). So if you wanna live, have
all three gals concentrate their attacks at Gecko in one swift combo. There's
no way it can possibly survive that. Or in more proffesional way - stone it.
That way we'll see just how desperate it really is, hehe.

3. <'Icebreath'> - IATT VS all chrs - ice mgd, arc attack
4. [Gun-Hater] - VS one chr - phd, attacks alchemists/gun mages/gunners
5. [Strength Up] - STR power increases as this fiend's HP rises for each 20%
   it recovers
6. [Strength Down] - on self - STR power decreases as this fiend's HP drops by
   each 20% you shave off
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
RGF, with some preparation, isn't annoying. It follows attack pattern of using
four 'bash'-es, followed by its breath attack, then repeat. It's immune to
both sleep and darkness. A way of stopping it in its tracks would be to apply
stop, petrification or insta-kill means of disposal. Having ice reducing stuff
equipped isn't a bad idea either.

In OSF all drake fiends follow analogy, similar to elemental fiends. Lower
drake's HP gets, lower its strength gets. On the other hand, all drake fiends
are capable of restoring HP with curative magic (set reflect on them to get
the curing instead). Gun girls will be continuously pelted by Gun-Hater -
either apply protect or use jobs that don't require guns.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
A thick headed bastard, extremely resilient to all types of attacks. Attack
pattern consists only of Body Splash. Heal each girl that got hit, for she
can't take second hit without being KO-ed. Eject, as usually, is one status
fiend isn't immune against. You can also confuse it.

OSF is more formiddable. First it'll reflect itself, then start cycling thru
lv1, lv2 and lv3 elements, finishing the cycle with Holy. After Holy the cycle
begins anew. If you throw any POSSE onto your girls, they'll be dispeled. If
you dispel Stalwart's reflect, it will counter that action by using 'smash'
once, followed by Body Splash.

3. [Frenzied Edge] - FRATTP VS one chr - fractional phd, tears off 25% current
   HP, used as counter to any attack
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Takouba of the blades - heh, sounds funny. However, battling this fiend isn't
funny. Blade Rondo, used on each fourth turn, is very strong and always hits.
To reduce damage you'll be taking, consider these options: Power Break on
Takouba, or darkness it. Heck, it's even susceptible to slow and stop, as well
as fire attacks.

OSF is like a yoyo. You hit it, but it hits back. Heh, Frenzied Edge is the
name of the move that will make your hair grow white pretty soon. Each time
Takouba takes damage will be each time Takouba counters - and if you're hit
four times without healing inbetween... there goes the KO, for Edge belongs to
fractional type attacks. Blade Rondo is used as 8th move, regardless of past
actions it took.

1. <'Slap'> - VS one chr - phd, induces darkness and slow
2. [Tentacle Slap] - VS one chr - phd, attacks five times in a row
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
RGF battle is a battle of being slow. Tentacle's 'slap' inflicts both darkness
and slow, making it quite a drag of getting an attack in. If you'll be
considering magic, avoid using gravity and water elements, as it absorbs them.
By taking a look at its status immunities, you'll see there's a wide variety
of NEGSE you can inflict - darkness and slow being worth mentioning.

OSF battle is not much different that RGF. Still possessing 'slap', Tentacles
also gains Tentacle Slap, which allows it to launch five attacks in a row.
Luckily this series of attacks don't carry any funny statuses attached.

4. [Sextuple Attack] - VS one chr - phd, attacks six times, always hits
5. [1000-Gil-Gnasher] - VS one chr - phd, total gil is decreased by 1000
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
This is another one of not-dangerous-suckas when navigating the Farplane.
Luckily it doesn't possess Killer Fang like its buddies, but has Mind Fang
instead, which drains MP. Tindalos will alternate between Strength Up and
'bite' or Mind Fang moves until it builds STR up +10, at which point Strength
Up is no longer used. Darknessing it is recommended. A couple of quick PATK
will send Tindalos rolling.

OSF is easier, but more annoying. For starters, it has lost its stupid
Strength Up and Mind Fang moves. Instead it gained Sextuple Attack and 1000-
Gil-Gnasher - former move always hits, regardless of your protection and
whatnot, while later checks YRP's pockets to see how much cash they carry.
Sextuple Attack's sequence can be interrupted by your girls attacking Lupus
and dealing damage to it, but it won't cancel it completely (unless Tindalos
enters pyrefly-mode). Seeing how it loses immunity to stop in OSF, use it to
your advantage.

chuck Fira at all girls. There is no way to predict what it'll use, sorry.

11. Break - VS one chr - induces petrify
12. ['Copycat move'] - OSF Ultima responds to following attacks by using the
    move you used against it unless specified otherwise - any black magic; any
    white magic except Auto-LifeHoly and Dispel; all Arcanas except Black Sky;
    Supernova and MP Absorb
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
How lucky do you think you are? Judgment and Punishment aren't to be scared
of, provided you have decent MDEF. Ultima's 'punch' is the lucky part - will
the girl hit receive poison or not? Unfortunately there is also no way to
predict when Judgment or Punishment will be used. When getting low on HP,
Ultima has few more aces up its sleeves (really?). First is using White
Highwind to recover heaps of HP. Second is using Mighty Guard G, making it
invincible to MATK and PATK (attacks that bypass protect and shell still work,
for example Darkness). And finally, it will pull off Meteor, whose damage is
based on MAX HP. Dangerous stuff, really.

OSF is more challenging. Besides Judgment and Punishment, it has also gained
Flare, Osmose, Dispel and ability to copy your moves. Therefore be careful of
what you use against Ultima. Its punch now deals only phd with no statuses
attached to it. As battle starts, you'll notice Ultima just sits there, doing
nothing. Don't let it fool you - as soon as you make a move against it, it'll
counter. You should consider using your most powerful attacls - don't attack
Ultima while it's in moving motion, or else your combos won't register.
Sometimes Ultima will act on its own and use one of many attacks it has.
Temporary POSSE are a waste of time, as they'll simply get dispeled.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Tch, nothing really so special about it - you may want to confuse it, so that
it uses W.I.M.P. on its fiend buddies, then watch them as they won't be able
to make a move. Vespa's ACCU is pretty good, so you may want to keep some
Antidotes handy should YRP get poisoned.

OSF Vespa is easier - Sharpened Needle attack doesn't carry any negative
statuses, but it grows progressively stronger each time Vespa manages to land
a successful hit. Again high EVA or darkness on Vespa help rectify the
situation. Both RGF and OSF are susceptible to many NEGSE, so be sure to
exploit them to their fullest advantage.

1. 'Bash' - VS one chr - phd
2. <Kaboom!> - FATT VS one chr - fire universal damage, reduces HP to 1, is
   used after taking damage six times
3. <'Expand2'> - on self - increases in size after taking damage two times
4. <'Expand3'> - on self - increases in size after taking damage four times
5. <Firaga> - FATT VS one chr(RGF)/all chrs(OSF) - fire mgd
6. [Flare] - NATT VS one chr - mgd
7. [Sextuple Attack] - VS one chr - phd, attacks six times, always hits
8. Tick-Tick-BOOM! - VS one chr - phd, induces doom
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
An interesting enemy. Attack it two times, it grows. Attack it twice more, it
grows again. Two more attacks and there goes the bomb. Occassional 'bash' and
weak Fira magic can be shrugged off, and you can add many statuses onto poor
Volcano. If it manages to somehow suicide, girl hit won't be killed, but will
merely have HP reduced to 1. Secret? Have fire absorbing stuff equipped. Also,
be careful of BOOM! - it adds doom status on girl hit.

OSF is not much different, except that Firaga now hits all girls, and it also
knows Flare. Then there's Sextuple Attack - six times the charm, I guess,
hehe. It concentrates more on using magic than PATK, anyway. Only stuff it
loses are its 'bash' and BOOM!

2. W.I.M.P. - VS one chr - phd, induces itchy
3. Triple Shock - VS one chr - phd, induces sleep, darkness and poison
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
RGF Queen is the most dangerous of wasp fiends. Not counting ever so annoying
W.I.M.P. attack its Triple Shock attack will really mess you up in the status
field. Guarding against sleep, darkness and poison is very welcome in fights
against Queen. Else be prepared to use lots of Remedies and spherechange a
lot. You can help yourself heaps if you inflict darkness on Queen, making it
hard for her to connect with her physicals.

OSF Queen is easier - Sharpened Needle attack doesn't carry any negative
statuses, but it grows progressively stronger each time Queen manages to land
a successful hit. Again high EVA or darkness on Queen help rectify the
situation.

2. <Magic Up> - on self - [increases MAG by +2]; MAG power increases as this

3. [Magic Down] - on self - MAG power decreases as this fiend's HP drops by
   each 20% you shave off
4. Osmose - VS one chr - MP stolen is added to White's MP
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Like all elementals - rob it of all MP and it becomes a kitten. Unless it
steals the MP back, which is what it'll do for sure. Sporting very high
resistance to PATK, using fire magic is the way to go. On each 3rd turn it
uses Magic Up, which increases damage it can do by MATK. Silence on White is
effective way of not being worried ever. Iceproof or better will ensure you
take no damage from its magic.

That is for RGF - but what about OSF? It gains nothing new, only thing worth
mentioning is that each time White loses 20% of HP, its MAG stat will
decrease, making its MATK less powerful. Effects can be reversed by raising
its HP, but why would you want to do that?

4. Strength Up - on self - [increases STR by +2 levels]
5. Killer Fang - VS one chr - induces KO
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Yet another lupine fiend with Killer Fang. It also often appears in packs
(fleeing is not cowardly, if it means survival). Where are your Angel Earrings
and Safety Bit acc? You have to make sure girls won't subdue to Killer Fang.
There's also an attack pattern too - 'bite' or Killer Fang being used for two
turns, followed by Strength Up (thus increasing damage Fang can do with its
PATK). Darkness it as well to raise your survival chances.

OSF is easier, but more annoying. For starters, it has lost its stupid
Strength Up and Killer Fang moves. Instead it gained Quadruple Attack and
1000-Gil-Gnasher - former move always hits, regardless of your protection and
whatnot, while later checks YRP's pockets to see how much cash they carry.
Quadruple Attack's sequence can be interrupted by your girls attacking Lupus
and dealing damage to it, but it won't cancel it completely (unless Fang
enters pyrefly-mode).

2. <'Bite'> - VS one chr - phd
3. [Triple Attack] - VS one chr - phd, attacks three times, always hits
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
RGF has no specific attack pattern. 'Bite' is all that Xipha will use, except
when its HP falls below 75%. In this case it'll use El Nino on first turn it
gets. Then we do have an attack pattern - three 'bite'-s, followed by El Nino.
Make sure you defeat Xipha before its 4th turn, else it'll really slow you
down by constantly adding slow on your girls. Tip: confuse or berserk it, and
let me not forget stop and darkness.

OSF gains one new attack, called Triple Attack. Be glad when it decides to use
it, cos it means that you have three turns of nothing to worry about. Xipha no
longer follows any distinctive attack pattern, meaning it can use El Nino
whenever it wants, so tread carefully. It now becomes immune to confusion and
berserk, but many other statuses can still be applied (like stop).

9. [Curse Punch] - STATT VS one chr - universal damage, tears off 12,5% MAX
   HP, induces curse
10. [Silence Punch] - STATT VS one chr - universal damage, tears off 12,5%
    MAX HP, induces silence
11. [Dispel] - VS all chrs - shatters most POSSE
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
YSLS-99 won't hesitate in using Haymaker, which deals big damage. When you see
it charging for an attack, it means it'll use Blast Punch - beware, this
attack is quite dangerous, for it tears off 1/2 of target girl's MAX HP and
damage cannot be reduced by shell or protect - so it's in your best interest
to keep your HP above half at all times. On top it delays hit girl's next turn
a lot.

In OSF state this fiend is far more predictable, esp by letting you know which
attacks it'll use. It gains the ability to inflict curse, poison and silence
on your girls with moves called Curse Mode, Silence Mode and Bio Mode. When it
enters one of the aforementioned modes, your party will be hit with three
punches carrying respective NEGSE. In addition these type of punches will
reduce hit girl's HP by 1/8, meaning you can be hit with it eight times before
being KO-ed. When the punching is used three times, OFF Mode move is issued.

Still, do not get careless, as it still has the ability to use Blast Punch and
Haymaker - keeping HP up should be one priority. Incidentally, you can inflict
curse, silence and poison on YSLS-99 yourself. Silence and curse are useless
(this fiend doesn't use magic and why the heck would you give it curse status,
I wonder), but poison can be quite good - for each HP you tear off, YRP is
closer to victory.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: FIGHTING TIPS ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Shantak's bigger brother. Much more HP than Shantak, you're in for a lengthy
battle. In RGF you'll be hit by 'bash' and Sonic Storm, with latter being used
on each 6th turn Zu gets. Apply protect to survive longer. At this point of
the game you should have some ways of inflicting KO (dark knight's Death
perhaps), which is most beneficial bad status to be used against this
overgrown bird.

OSF is dangerous, when battle's initiating. Zu begins with Chicken Wing, which
can KO your whole team, if bird is lucky enough to gain critical strike on all
girls. Chicken will be followed by Phoenix Down Vortex, crappy attack which
wipes 5 Phoenix Downs out of your inventory - boohoo, even more gil down the
drain. Sonic Boom is used afterwards, and then 'bash' forever and ever. Status
immunity is the same as in RGF.

=============================================================================
                                 THE ANSWERS!
=============================================================================
A001: You have to get Episode Complete for each of the 15 areas that cover
      Spira. If you receive at least one Episode Concluded, you will not get
      mascot this time around. Getting 100% is NOT required for mascot,
      Episode Complete for every area is. Well, why not just view this guide:
      db.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/file/final_fantasy_x_2_mascot_speed.txt

A002: Yes. Den of Woe in Mushroom Rock, Via Infinito in Bevelle, Fiend Colony
      dungeon on Mi'ihen, Ruin Depths dungeon in Calm lands, O'aka's mission
      in Macalania Woods, Gunner's Gauntlet on Besaid in CH2 and bridal
      mission do NOT have to be completed in order to receive mascot.

A003: By all means, no! This game was meant to be played again - that's why
      there's New Game Plus feature. If you're going for mascot, I can
      understand your desire to play again, but think about it. You'll have
      to start from scratch, without items, acc, DSP and abilities you've
      gained so far, you'll have to watch all the scenes again... True, in
      New Game Plus you have to do all the stuff again, but you get to *keep*
      what I mentioned above! And most scenes you've already seen can be
      skipped.

A004: Once you beat the game by defeating final boss, let the game's credits
      roll. In the end a window will appear asking you if you wish to make
      New Game Plus data. Save the data in a different slot!
      New Game Plus allows you to replay the game infinitely. Here's just
      some basic info on what you keep: gil, DSP and abilities you've
      found/mastered, accessories, GG, all items except Gysahl Greens, all
      primers you've found so far, and 8 key items that enable songstress and
      SDSP to learn specific abilities. For more detailed explanation on what
      are all things that carry over, you should consult this guide:
      db.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/file/final_fantasy_x_2_new_game_plus.txt

A005: This in-depth guide of fellow guide writer will answer it best:
      db.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/file/final_fantasy_x_2_ending.txt

A006: You may have completed every mission, but did you do it *perfectly*?
      Most critical example of why people don't receive EPCOM is Moonflow -
      if you lose even one piece of luggage, or don't sell all 10 tickets
      with a profit or breaking even, you can't get EPCOM for Moonflow, no
      matter what you do.
      Second critical mistake players make is in CH3 - you have to visit
      every area of Spira so that Shinra installs his CommSpheres. There's 20
      CommSpheres in total that must be installed. Doing so not only ensures
      that you get EPCOM in the areas, but also ensures you don't fail in
      getting mascot.
      As for the third critical mistake - you may have missed a CommSphere
      event. Believe it or not, but just because you didn't view a scene cos
      it may have been boring... just maybe that might have been the scene
      which screwed you out of the mascot.

A007: That won't work at all. EPCOM in ALL AREAS OF SPIRA is required. You
      didn't get Isaaru to return to Bevelle, so you're screwed for mascot
      this time around. Play with caution next time around.

A008: Yes. You have to side with Youth League and get Episode Complete for
      every area. You must also complete Den of Woe dungeon in Mushroom Rock,
      Ruin Depths dungeon in Calm lands, and defeat Mr T. on floor 100 of Via
      Infinito.

A009: Yes. As I said, make sure you choose Youth League. Follow my guide by
      the letter and you will receive 100% in one playthru. If you're having
      trouble following my guide, then I suggest you check out one of three
      100% guides, made specifically for that purpose:
      db.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/file/final_fantasy_x_2_100_story.txt
      db.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/file/final_fantasy_x_2_100_story_na.txt
      db.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/file/final_fantasy_x2_100_perfect.txt

A010: I have made an in-depth BOSS guide, which includes great details on how
      to defeat any and all bosses in the game (not to mention I find it very
      difficult to believe boss strats in *this* guide can't 'help' you):
      db.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/file/final_fantasy_x_2_boss.txt

A011: Okay, let's try something else. Many bosses that aren't 'unique' can be
      defeated by one of the cheese ways listed below:
      - Bribe - the usual formula is: fiend's MAX HP x6,25 = Bribe; just to
        be on the safe side, have lady luck try her luck with x8
      - Eject - berserker's Eject, thief's Steal Will, trainer's Carrier
        Flurry or Kogoro Strike have a chance of ejecting the enemy
      - Spare Change - samurai uses extra gil to inflict special damage on
        enemies
      - Charon - dark knight with at least 5000 MAX HP will deal 9999 damage
        with this ability - naturally, you'll lose dark knight, but if it
        takes out the boss you're having trouble with...
      - Random Reels - getting 777 on lady luck's Random Reels is thrice the
        charm - you get cash and items from all enemies, enemies leave the
        battle (assuming they aren't immune to Bribe), and you also score
        EXP, cash and AP for 'defeating' them in battle
      - Zantetsu - samurai's ability, which works on any and all enemies; of
        course, expect (some) enemies to have (very) high resistance to it

A012: All this and more is covered in Chocobo Ranch guide I made:
      db.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/file/final_fantasy_x_2_chocobo.txt

A013: All this and more is covered in Blue Bullet guide I made:
      db.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/file/final_fantasy_x_2_blue_bullet.txt

A014: It just so happens that I have an in-depth guide covering that:

A015: It just so happens that I have an in-depth guide covering that:
db.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/file/final_fantasy_x_2_dress_grid_locations.txt

A016: Again, I have written an in-depth guide for this issue:
      db.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/file/final_fantasy_x_2_gunner_gauntlet.txt

A017: In-depth guide here:
      db.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/file/final_fantasy_x_2_reels_and_dice.txt

A018: You should check out my Mix guide here:
      db.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/file/final_fantasy_x_2_mix.txt

A019: Optional Missions guide will be your destiny:
      db.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/file/final_fantasy_x_2_optional.txt

A020: You *must* help Rin in the investigation, which is started in order to
      explain why did machina go haywire in CH3 and why did hover crash in
      CH2. As there's many a choices to be made in Rin's Mi'ihen Mystery, you
      should check out this guide I've made (also, if you're shooting for
      100% in one go, you must get Rikku as the culprit!):
      db.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/file/final_fantasy_x_2_rin_mystery.txt

A021: You prolly didn't had Shinra set up extra CommSphere or didn't attack
      the machina on the ledge in the way I specified. If this is the case,
      do this (save your game first, so that you can retry in case something
      misfires in CH5): in lv1 gather enough VS Rikku evidence, in lv2 gather
      enough evidence for someone else (most likely choice will be Eater) and
      in lv3 gather enough VS Rikku evidence. Voila!

A022: Oh my, a lot of stuff, huh?
      Iron Duke - defeat Mr T. on floor 100 of Via Infinito
      Enterprise - skip Moonflow mission in CH1, then Tobli appears in front
                   of Cabin in CH2; push him in the lift first, followed by
                   other musicians
      Invincible - talk to cameraman on the boat in Kilika in CH1 and 3; when
                   you're in CH5, talk to him again and choose to go across
                   to the island; check the square shape in the minimap
      Cat Nip - defeat Black Elemental on floor 40 of Via Infinito in CH5
      Force of Nature - in CH5 after rescue mission in New Cave on Thunder

                        it again; again solve all 16 riddles and chest with
                        this acc will appear
      Wring - in 'Bevelle - gaol' screen; for details on how to reach the
              chest check Storyline Mission 8 entry
      Bloodlust - same instructions as for Wring
      Minerva's Plate - attempt Moonflow mission in CH1, but DO NOT TALK TO
                        TOBLI; ensure that all five bags are safe; then
                        complete the Macalania mission in CH2 involving the
                        musicians; afterwards return to the Hypello found in
                        'Macalania Woods - south' and speak to it
      Adamantite - reach lv MAX in Beclem's version Gunner's Gauntlet; you
                   can only receive one copy of this accessory ever
      AP Egg - blitz prize; or get one in Calm Lands - Ruin Depths dungeon
      Charm Bangle - steal one from Mr B. first time you fight him, Slim
                     drops one in one of many fights with him, or buy one
                     from Open Air company in Calm lands while they're still
                     at lv1 publicity
      Heady Perfume - massage LB., but fail first time around; any attempt
                      afterwards will award you with Heady Perfume
      Key to Success - do NOT attempt Gagazet mission in CH3; also, at least
                       one of Tobli-related missions must be done perfectly
                       (I got Key to Success by only completing Macalania
                       musicians quest in CH2); in CH5 enter Tobli's office
                       and open the chest
      Ragnarok - Rikku must be the culprit in Rin's Mi'ihen Mystery
      Ribbon - Bribe oversouled Flailing Ochu, Ultima Weapon or Omega Weapon

      Should the above information not prove satisfactory to you, or if you
      need info on where to find other acc, here's a link to Accessory FAQ:
      http://db.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/file/final_fantasy_x_2_accessory.txt

A023: Here's some fast ways to attain these items quickly.
      Mega-Potion - Bribe Elder Drake or Phantom
      Megalixir - a steady income is provided by Bribing Earth Worm
      Soul Spring - bribe Wight or Lich

A024: Most fiends belong to fiend-type. Once you kill predetermined amount of
      fiends that belong to specific fiend-type, next fiend from that fiend-
      type oversouls. Amount of fiends needed to kill for one to oversoul
      will appear below. Also, once a fiend oversouls, you DO NOT have to
      kill it in order to have it registered in Shinra's bestiary. Once the
      fiend oversouls, you can run away and it will still count. This also
      involves neat trick: let's say you're only left with oversouling Spine
      Drake and Greater Drake. Kill enough Drake fiends so that one oversouls
      and run away. Now seek out Spine Drake - it will oversoul! Escape and
      do the same for Greater Drake.

      And as a final note: Oversoul counter and data on fiends oversouled so
      far carries onto New Game Plus.

A026: There would be too much spoilers involved in revealing this info, so I
      will have to kindly ask you to resort to other guides.

A027: You need to find two key items that enable her to learn them.
      - collect all 10 Crimson Spheres and complete Den of Woe dungeon and
        you will receive Magical Dances, Vol. I key item
      - defeat Experiment in Djose temple while all its attributes are at lv5
        and you will receive Magical Dances, Vol. II key item

A028: For each girl you have to find a key item that enables them to learn
      Break HP Limit and Break Damage Limit abilities. And - CH5 ONLY!
      Corpus Invictus: Inside Thunder Plains - New Cave, AFTER you've been on
                       a rescue mission there.
      Victor Primoris: You must be able to ride chocobos - this is possible
                       if you complete Rin's Mi'ihem Mystery and get any
                       suspect but Prophet! Mi'ihen 'Highroad - newroad, N' -
                       look carefully for a chocobo feather. Stand on it a
                       few seconds (be patient!) and then select [Am I
                       ever!], when choices pop up - nab the first chest.
                       Leave this screen and then return to the EXACT SAME
                       SPOT. Again wait - this time it takes some time before
                       choices appear. Select [Am I ever!] again and voila.
      Aurora Rain: Calm lands, cavern of smelly faith. Enter the fayth
                   chamber, check the chest and voila.
      Twilight Rain: Besaid - waterfall way. Southernmost of the bridges
                     (according to minimap) has a spot behind it at which you
                     can drop down to some rocks. Check the chest and voila.
      Machina Booster: Mushroom - Headquarters lift. Look below the lift for
                       a chest - and voila.
      Machina Reactor: Calm lands - Ruins depths dungeon. Open the dungeon by
                       following the steps provided in my Chocobo ranch
                       guide. Then refer to the map I'll give below to find
                       where this item is hiding - voila.
      db.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/file/final_fantasy_x_2_chocobo_dungeon.gif

A029: SDSP cannot be placed on GG; you can change into them only when a girl
      has been in every DSP on her GG. Let's say you have Protection Halo GG
      equipped for Yuna with gunner, warrior, thief, black mage, and white
      mage on it, and she starts off as gunner in battle. In order to change
      into Floral Fallal, she must change into warrior, thief, black mage,
      and white mage DSP. After that, bring up the GG and press R1 for her
      SDSP. When you use SDSP, the other two girls disappear. You lose Rikku
      & Paine, and now you have a party of Yuna along with two other 'parts'.
      SDSP are not given to you in the beginning of the game; you must find
      them before you can use them.
      Note: You can easily see what path you took on specific GG by looking
      at the connecting lines - ones you've already taken are displayed in
      blue. Note that you do NOT have to cross all lines before SDSP is
      available - it matters that you change into each DSP on the GG.

A030: If you've run out of people to promote to, all is not lost. Play Sky
      Slots minigame for THE COMPANY YOU'RE ADVERTISING FOR. Every time you
      *lose* 200 credits in the minigame, you get 1 PR point. Get 400+ points
      for the company, then beam on Celsius. Now talk to MN and Calm lands
      will become HS. There you go.

A031: It is possible, but tiring. What you must do is: select to advertise
      for Argent first. In CH1 or 2 (doesn't really matter, tho') MAKE SURE
      you get at least 802+ points for Argent. Now switch companies -
      Argent's PR rating will go down to 401+ (which is still enough for
      Lv5), while Open Air's starts at 0. Simply accrue over 401+ points for
      Open Air by CH5 and you're good to go. Playing lots of Sky Slots is a
      necessity in this scenario! In CH5 you will then be able to buy
      complete sets of rewards from both companies, as well as open both
      extra minigames.

A032: Er, hard to say. If you're going for GG, then you may consider it. Each
      company sells one GG if it's brought to lv5 publicity - each of these
      GG will cost you 200000 credits. It appears as ?????? on the 'Trade in
      credits' menu. Also, you must get *one* company to lv5 for 100% -
      getting both produces same effect and awards no extra %.

A033: There's a max PR level per CH. In CH1 it is lv2, in CH2 it is lv3, and
      in CH3 it is lv4.

A034: Certainly not. Sky Slots will become your best friend for about one
      hour, hehe. What does this mean? Buy whole bunch of credits from the
      representative of the company you're advertising for. Then address same
      person and choose to play Sky Slots. Make sure you LOSE credits. After
      losing specific amount of credits, you gain 1 PR point. Continue to
      play and lose credits until you gain 400+ points. Once that is done,
      get on Celsius. Now talk to MN and Calm lands will turn into HS.
      Episode Complete!

A035: Your call. For me, all of those five minigames blow. Anything and
      everything you can win are just extra credits. I can easily buy them,
      so why bother in the first place?

A036: In my opinion, it sucks. It isn't important for 100%, EPCOM, doesn't
      add any % and is plain boring. Only two rewards you can receive are: 0
      to 29 points Elixir, and from 30+ onward Speed Bracer. Woot woot? Your
      call.

A037: Gippal's - Pin Rin in Rin's Mi'ihen Mystery. Details are found in my
                 guide by same name.
      Baralai's - Get EPCOM in Guadosalam. Then return to Guadosalam and talk
                  to Tromell, who will unlock the closed door in NW part.
                  Inside you'll find the sphere in one of the chests.
      Nooj's - You must side with Youth League. Get EPCOM for Mushroom. Enter
               Youth League HQ and go to War Room. Now find the long balcony
               and speak to Lucil.

A038: There's 10 towers available for calibration. You MUST attempt all of
      them at least once, and you MUST calibrate five of them perfectly (I
      suggest 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6). Only then will you receive the GG from tech
      in the agency.

A039: It's to the left of tower 8. Keep hugging left end of the area and mash
      X until Yuna spots the tower across the lake.

A040: This one depends. I only do it to get that GG, than I forget about it -
      not worth the frustration (blows up towers 7, 8 and 10). Also, amount
      of successful calibrations affects the rewards you receive in CH5 when
      doing a subquest here. Your call if you wish to bother for them,
      however, know this: all of the items you'll receive can be found
      elsewhere in easier ways. Oh, and it doesn't affect % in any way. Only
      thing it will affect is you being frustrated.

A041: Okay, here's their hideouts...
      1st: Bikanel - Oasis.
      2nd: Besaid - beach.
      3rd: Guadosalam - secret passageway. In the room just ahead from SSP.
      4th: Calm lands - bridge between Gagazet and Calm lands screen.
      5th: Same as 4th Cactuar.
      6th: N-most end of 'TP - north'. There's a shelter-like structure found
           in this area - look for Cactuar stone opposite of it. If you're
           looking for it in CH5, finish Fallen Genius subquest first.
      7th: It's hiding all the way on Kilika. As you enter Kilika forest, go
           like this - N over the bridge, then E. Pay attention now! First
           tree you'll see bending over the water is your cue - a mark to
           press Circle will appear in lower right, so do it. Get all needles
           you need up here.
      8th: Beam to Gagazet. If you already got Episode Complete for Gagazet,
           you'll appear near the top, in which case you need to drop down,
           then go right. Make it to 'G - prominence' - there's a spot of
           greenery to be found here. If you haven't achieved Episode
           Complete yet, you'll appear at the base of Gagazet - in this case
           use teleporter here, then it's just few more steps up until you
           reach the clearing mentioned before.
      9th: Kilika in Dona's house.
      FIN: Once you deliver 9th Cactuar, speak to Cactuar mom of final
           Cactuar, then speak to Marnela. Enter Cactuar Hollow in Cactuar
           Nation and make it to the end.

A042: You're only required to beat Frailea to get the GG. If you fail first
      time around, beat Angra. Now return to Cactuar Nation and challenge
      Frailea for as many times you want (it'll be one of the Cactuars who
      are forming a circle in the middle of Cactuar Nation).

A043: Literally all oversoulable enemies can be found in Via Infinito in CH5
      on various floors (don't ask me which, refer to Monster Guide for that
      info). Only exceptions are:
      - Georapella and Precepts Guard, who can be fought infinitely anyway in
        Bevelle - forbidden area by checking respective tower
      - Chocobo Eater, Anything Eater, Jumbo Cactuar, King VERMIN!, Azi
        Dahaka: these must be killed in their respective subquests first,
        only then will they appear in Via Infinito

A044: Know that any and all Elders and Megas can be avoided. You just need to
      look around and use the environment to your advantage. Also, once you
      engage in battle with Elder or Mega, that was *seen* on the screen, you
      cannot escape - you will have to kill it.
      If you simply cannot back down from a challenge and must kill that
      Elder or Mega that's been laughing at you all this time, mastered
      berserker with Force of Nature will make mincemeat out of Elder in no
      time. As for Mega, having great DEF is a must, for even at 255 DEF with
      protect in place Mega will tear off 1000 HP, not to mention it's quite
      fast in launching Chef's Knife.

A045: Any other ability works, EXCEPT No Encounters (and one other exception
      found below). Sorry.

A046: This is other exception I've mentioned. Regardless of protection you
      have, Chac's Stony Glare will petrify girls. Use Remedy, Soft or Esuna
      ASAP. There's more instances where Ribbon fails: Mushroom Cloud's
      Powder will induce itchy, and Mega Tonberry's Karma will add confusion
      regardless.

A047: A list, huh?
      CS1 : CH3 - Bevelle, limbo - AFTER completing Kilika and Besaid HS, but
            BEFORE defeating boss of Djose HS, return to Bevelle. Make it all
            the way down to where you fought Dark B. After the scene kill
            Malboro in battle, then pick up the sphere.
      CS2 : CH3 - received automatically.
      CS3 : CH3 - received automatically.
      CS4 : CH3, 5 - Guadosalam, hidden passage - proceed thru the hallway
            until you reach SSP. Now turn left and thru the circular door.
            Take a look at minimap - see how there's a shape of 'C' letter
            around the room where you're in? And at the base it seems to be
            connected? That's your clue - directions provided now are based
            on minimap. Have Yuna turn S and climb stack of boxes by holding
            Circle. Climb up higher once more and you'll be on the catwalk.
            Make it all the way around and storm the chest.
      CS5 : CH4 - Celsius, engine room - After Yuna's concert is finished, DO
            NOT TALK to Shinra. Instead go down to engine room.
      CS6 : CH5 - Bevelle, Via Infinito - enter Cloister 0 and you will find
            it in plain sight after initial scene ends.
      CS7 : CH2 - Go to Mushroom rock - ravine. Again drop in the ravine and
            make it all the way N. Enter the cave near the SSP.
      CS8 : CH5 - Bevelle, Via Infinito - enter Cloister 20, defeat the boss
            and you will find it in plain sight.
      CS9 : CH1 - Mushroom - while doing 'Foggy Fiend Frenzy' mission, drop
            in the ravine and make it all the way N. Enter the cave near the
            SSP - when scene ends, it's yours.
      CS10: CH2 - Guadosalam - Once you defeat Fatso, enter Slim's room (just
            follow the red arrow). You'll see the sphere in plain sight.

A048: Sorry, but no. All CS, except CS4, are chapter exclusive. If you missed
      any, you'll have to get it/them in New Game Plus.

A049: Sorry, but no. EPCOMs do not carry over, so you'll have to do everything
      that is required for mascot yet again. Still, the requirement list is
      not big, so it shouldn't take you long to claim mascot.

A050: You have Minerva's Plate acc equipped. Remove it and YRP will be
      rolling in EXP in no time.

A051: You have Lure Bracer acc equipped. Remove it.

A052: First go to following URL (pic provided by GDD):
      http://tinyurl.com/2jln8

      GDD also comments: You need 2 (rubber) bands & 1 piece of anything to
      press X. Left analog stick to left direction because it has no function
      during battles. Prepare for the first battle and then let it run for a
      few hours to become level 99 and rich. Floor 65 of Via Infinito is good
      cos of Earth Worm that appears on this floor.
      Equipment and attack should be Yuna in lady luck DSP, Rikku in lady luck
      DSP and Paine in white mage DSP, all three with Highroad Winds GG. You
      may consider optional Lure Bracer acc.
      Attack sequence goes: Paine Pray, Yuna attacks and Rikku attacks.

A053: The pause trick allows you to get CONGRATS! rather easily:
      To get CONGRATS! easily, repeatedly press Start while the reels are
      spinning and press X when the 7 is near the middle. If you time it
      right, the 7 should land on the bottom. Repeat for remaining reels.
