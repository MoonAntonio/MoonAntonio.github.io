INTRODUCTION

The reason I am writing this quide is very simple. It is to help all of those
people looking to get this game, and to help those that need to know about
something. One thing that is good about this guide is that it is never-ending.
I will always keep updating it.

01-Updates


---This Guide's History---
Version 1.50 (Final)
My Final Effort

Includes: N/A
Expands On: . . .

I'm sorry for my lack of updates. School was more challenging this past year
and I forgot about my guide. However my grades have been top-notch and I'm
content. I wanted to give one final word before I say goodbye to this guide.
Anything that I have said will be coming, will unfortunatly not be coming.

Firstly, let me say that this guide was originally created for the sole purpose
of educating the public about this game. I knew there would be far more
efficient methods used in the future and I would never be on top. But for a
time I would like to think that I gave people information when it was lacking.
I made many friends through this guide and solved many problems various players
had. I have no regrets other then the fact that I never truly pulled this guide
throughout my FFXI lifespan.

Yes, if you desire to know, I still play and I havn't seen the end of the road.
Infact I can still see myself playing for years to come. But I had to make a
word about this to the public. Don't ask me why. I just needed if off my back.

I think the only thing I really ever hated about this guide was when it was
copied and sold for profit on e-bay. I must say, I hate people like that. But
it was and is a natural part of life. Either way, if you buy something like
that, which I might add can easily be found online, you are an idiot.

If you havn't looked by now, there are many sites with great information all
over the internet. Here are some with more information then you could ask for:

http://ffxi.allakhazam.com/
http://www.killingifrit.com/
http://mysterytour.web.infoseek.co.jp/ffxi/us/
http://ffxi.somepage.com/
and last, but most definatly not least...
http://www.ffxi-atlas.com/

Anywho, if you really want to talk to me, you probably have. But either way, I
still talk whenever I'm on AIM (ZalkRagnarok), albeit rarely, to answer
questions. If you /t Altimo ingame on the Ragnarok server, I'll be sure to talk
as long as I'm not in the middle of something. ^^;

My final word... hmm... Have fun with the game. Really, make some good friends
and do your best to become a good player. Just don't buy gil. XD


Oh, and remember my name. Hopefully I'll do something with my life. Write a
book? Maybe. =P

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Version 1.25
Tons And Tons Of Stuff

Includes: N/A
Expands On: Jobs, Equipment, Magic, and Weapon Skills sections

I will say that my armor section is pretty much 85% complete. However, because
of vacations, projects, and school commitments, getting on my e-mail bi-daily
is very hard. Even weekly is hurting my time. If my you dont get a response
right away, I'm very sorry.

I have added in some of the weapon skills and corrected some messups in the
magic section. So all is well there.

Aside from that, I am also sorry for lack of recent updates. It has been ~3
months since last update. Hopefully I will get back on a better scedule when
summer comes. Maybe I can even get an update out soon fnishing up the armors
and weapon skills.

On a lighter note, this is the 1 year aniversary of this FAQ. And that is why I
bothered updating so much in the course of a week. Be glad, as I used valuable
PT hours working on this.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Version 1.20
More Armor Updates And 2 Patches

Inclides: N/A
Expands On: Jobs and Equipment sections

Well, almost all of the armors are in, making my list for armor about 70-80%
complete. The Lv75 Cap was also added in a recent patch. I have also shown max
stats in the Jobs section to reflect lv75. Also other random stuff.

And please, I put a lot of time into it. Check out my armor section. It is
probably the most complete armor section out of any website. The only things it
doesn't show are the jobs that can use it and if it has a (Rare) or (EX) sign
next to it. :p

Sorry about the lack of updates. I havn't had the time to sit and work on this
in the past couple months or so.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Version 1.15
Been Real Busy

Includes: N/A
Expands On: Starting Up, Jobs, Magic, Equipment, Special Thanks sections

I swear I had to copy down 700+ different types of armors. When you look at the
Equipment section now, you may have a much more understanding of how much
equipment is in this game. And I havn't even added more weapons yet. However, I
am not done with armors. I have only done most body armors, head armors, back
armors, and shield armors. I need to do the other sections. If you can
contribute weapons and stuff not found in the auction house, that would be
great. Basically, weapons and armors that you cannot trade. And if someone
wants to contribute a list of all of the swords or any type of weapon, that
would help out a lot.

I also did some minor Magic section changes. Magic things have been changed
from numbers to roman numerals to better reflect how they look in the game. For
instance, Fire 2 will now say Fire II. I also made some summon corrections and
some corrections on Job Abilities and added a few more commands in the Starting
Up section. And...last but not least...I changed some things in the AF section
to make it easier to read.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Version 1.10
Searching Vana'diel

Includes: N/A
Expands On: Mog House and Areas sections

I finally included a new part to my guide...Areas. This is where I explain
about the different areas in the world. While I have explored a lot, I need
some descritions on places. The other thing I added was my thing on the mog
house. It was just a thing (not in the game that I made up) that people were
requesting -- How to go into other moghouses. I wonder if it will ever reach
S-Es doorstep.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Version 1.05
I Have The US Version

Includes: N/A
Expands On: Guilds section

I only have one major change with this guide...I have the US version. And many
others do now. This will make info. gathering easier to say the least.

My character is as follows:
Handle: Altimo
Characters: Altimo (Ragnarok)

My other things I have to add is that I added some info on generally what
guilds are. While it isnt super large...it is some.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Version 1.00
A Lot Of Armor

Includes: N/A
Expands On: Equipment and Starting Up sections

Well, I got more  armor in my guide now including the RSE equip and the
starting rings for each country. I am still waiting to introduce other random
info into my guide. I have a lot of info, but it is either jumbled up in
everything or it is not complete.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Version .95
E-Mails Give Influence

Inlcudes: Areas
Expands On: Besidary and many different areas (cant remember which exactly)

In this I added where you can find NPCs for World Passes. Im also added some
random corrections. As you may notice, this is version .95. Version 1.00 will
not be like a normal guides version 1.00. Instead, it is just like a normal
checkpoint much like any one of my other updates. My guide still is not
complete and I will needed to add a lot more to it. I may actually make an
item guide in the future. If you want to know what that will be ablout, e-mail
me. The Areas section is not yet started.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Version .90
Finishing Up Some Needed Points

Includes: N/A
Expands On: Jobs section.

I finally added the last two advanced job quests (SMN and SAM). And I included
more detail on the main races. There are also a few minor changes here and
there. Mostly things having to relate to the Benchmark 2 program.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Version .85
Some Good Changes

Includes: N/A
Expands On: Weapons+Armor and Magic sections.

This version I added some summon spells in the magic section under summons. I
Also changed where ever it said "LVL" to "Lv" to make it easier to read. The
weapons section has more weapons and some corrections. I also added in Armors!
However, since there is more infromation, it is a bit jumbled, but in its right
place. Check it out if you dont understand what I'm saying. But it was a lot of
additions. Hours of typing...gah.

We also now know that FFXI will be released on the HDD Pre-downloaded for $99.
That only applies to the PS2 version.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Version .80
Im Running Back On Track Again

Includes: N/A
Expands On: Weapons+Armor, FAQ, and Special Thanks sections.

I added in how you can decode your score for the benchmark test in the FAQ
section. I also added all of the AF stats (thanks to RPGdemon and some others).

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Version .75
Some Good News, Some Bad

Includes: N/A
Expands On: Story, Conquest, and Classes sections.

Well, lets start off with the good news. The good news is that the update fills
in the rest of the advanced jobs (besides SUM quest). I also added the "History
of Vana'deil" in the story section and the "History of Conquest" in the
Conquest section.The bad news is that the money needed for the game is a bit up
in price. Now we know that there is a free 30-day trial, which is a good thing.
But now the price is upped from $10 per month, to $12.95. But there is more.
Each extra character is $1 and Tetra Master is now $1. Oh well. If I have to
pay it to play, I most definatly will. But this was somewhat to be expected.
The Japanese monthly fee is around $13. Either way, I think it is worth it. It
isnt much more money. Especially if you have been saving up for the US version
for a while ($329 saved up for me).

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Version .70
For The lv70 Cap

Includes: N/A
Expands On: FAQ, Classes, and Magic sections.(By a lot!)

I added Black Magic and White Magic to this version. I also added the time you
need to use Abilities and so on. Dragoon Job quest is added and Dragoon,
Paladin, Bard, Dark Knight, Ranger, Beastmaster, and Samurai jobs were added. I
also upped the jobs level cap to 70 because of the patch on Thursday. Some new
questions were added in the F.A.Q.s

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Version .65
Character Creation

Includes: N/A
Expands On: Starting Up section.

I just decided to do a Startup of the game sub-section. I had planned on it
before, but I finally decided to go with it after I found out they were the
same for the Japanese version and the US version. It is a very small section
right now, however.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Version .60
Quite a Bit of Changes

Includes: N/A
Expands On: Servers and Magic sections.

The Magic section was expanded a bit. There is lots of info I got from
people/websites. I added songs mostly.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Version .55
Some Changes Made

Includes: N/A
Expands On: Special Thanks, Magic, and Beastidary sections.

Most of the changes were very small. Just spelling/grammer mistakes for the
most part. Other minor changes. That is why it was only upgraded by .05 points.
I just want to say that I need all the help I can get. My spell checker needs
to get fixed. That is one reason I cant send this through a spell-checker.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Version .50
First Version

Includes: How To Use This Guide, Updates, The Story, Starting Up, The Basics,
Conquest, Missions + Quests, Classes, Servers, Linkshells, Guild/Side
Activities, Magic, Weapons + Armor, Weapon Skill, Special Effects, Moghouse,
Tetra Master, Beastidary, FAQ, Special Thanks, and Closing sections.
Expands On: N/A

I am not complete on a few sections of my guide. It is mostly a work in
progress, but atleast it provides some info that is not already posted in the
GameFAQs archive.

02-The Story


---Prologue---

The legend begins as so.
The Beginning of everything was with the stone.

A long long time ago, this beautiful living stone,
with its shining of seven colors banished the darkness,
filled the world with life,
and gave birth to powerful gods.

Happiness and light blessed ages continued,
and soon the gods have gone to their sleep.
The name of the world is Vana'diel.

Sometime after, a great tribulation was about to fill this blessed land of
Vana'diel.
The ancient seal, after resisting dark power for thousands of years,
was broken and awakening the endless nightmare.

Innocent blood will flow through the great land.
The world will be enveloped by fear, sadness, and disparity.

However, this does not mean there is no hope...
There exists one star, shining brightly even through the nights of the
harshest storms.
There exists a powerful song, not being vanished by the howls of any beasts.

That's right.
Proud ones,
filled with wisdom, courage and determination...

Now, awaken from the dark slumber.
Stand now, the legendary heroes.
The Crystal Warriors!

---Story---

It all began with a stone,
Or so the legend says.

In ages past,
The sentient jewel,
Enormous and beautiful,
Banished the darkness.

It's many-colored light filled the world with life
And brought forth-mighty gods.

Bathed in that light,
The world entered an age of bliss,
Until after a time,
The gods fell into slumber.
That world was called Vana'diel.
-
-
-
In the 863rd year of the Crystal Era, Vana'diel was in the midst of a great
war. Faced with the invasion of the Shadow Lord and his hordes of beast men,
the leaders of the enlightened peoples united their forces in desperate
alliance. They were the Kingdom of San d'Oria, the Republic of Bastok, the
Federation of Windurst, and the Grand Duchy of Jeuno. Together they struggled
for survival in battle after battle as chaos engulfed the land.

--------------------------
---History of Vana'deil---
--------------------------

The world of Vana’diel is a crossroads of magic, swords, and technology.
It is also a battlefield where those who believe in light face monsters that
thrive in darkness. The struggle centers on the control of crystals: sacred
stones that are the fundamental source of all creation.

The monsters showed no mercy as they laid waste to beautiful towns, ravaged the
land, and polluted the streams and rivers of Vana’diel. But the people united
to seize victory from the jaws of the beastmen, earning themselves temporary
respite from a life-and-death struggle.

Twenty years have passed since the people’s great victory. But now, even as
the memories of battle have begun to fade, a new evil grows inside Vana’diel...

And it hungers for the power of the crystals.

---Ancient Memories---

Long, long ago, an ancient race, descended from the gods, flourished in
Vana'diel. They traveled through the sky, extracted gold from stones, and gave
birth to grasslands across the world.

But one day, they decided to build a pathway to the divine entrance of
paradise. Enraged by such a brazen display of insolence, the holy gatekeeper
destroyed their path and cast their homes to the bottom of the sea.

Shortly thereafter, the goddess Altana awakened and saw the ruin that had had
once been Vana'diel. Saddened, She wept five divine tears. When the five tears
fell upon the earth, they gave life to the five races of Vana’diel.

But the god Promathia saw this from His place in the shadows. Promathia saw fit
to condemn Her work, cursing the people with eternal conflict amongst
themselves.

He created terrible beasts and spread them across the world, commanding them to
fight the people of Vana'diel and occupy their minds. Never again would they
think to open the door to the gods.

---The Age of Beasts---

The beastmen thrived in the ensuing era of darkness.

But the demihuman Galka and Mithra, blessed with bodies powerful enough to
resist the advances of the beastmen, grew in number as well. They fought tooth
and nail to cast the hordes from their homelands in an age of unending battle
and chaos.

The Tarutaru race grew weary of the never-ending conflict, and wandered the
world in search of peace. After discovering an uncharted continent, they named
the land Windurst and settled down to build a brighter future for their kin.

Several decades after the Tarutaru’s long journey had come to an end, a young
Tarutaru girl lost her way in one of the mysterious towers scattered across the
outskirts of Windurst. It was there that the secrets of magic were revealed to
her, and this knowledge would spread to her entire race. The Tarutaru worked as
one to harness and understand the mysterious power that had been given to them.
So began the Great Age of Magic.

---The Age of Magic---

Empowered by their expanding magical abilities, the Tarutaru united themselves
as the Federation of Windurst, and worked to drive the hordes of Yagudo
beastmen from their lands. The Tarutaru prospered, unified by their knowledge
of magic and the solidarity of a new federation. It was a glorious age for
their people.

But revealed secrets cannot be suppressed, and the knowledge of magic slowly
spread to all the people of Vana'diel. Within a short time, other races - and
even beastmen - began to employ magic techniques for themselves.

Filled with regret, the Tarutaru entered an era of isolation. They closed their
borders to all but their longtime friends, the Mithra. And so, a once-proud
civilization became more and more out of touch with the rest of the world.

---The Age of Power---

The use of magic brought both happiness and conflict to the other races of
Vana’diel. Perhaps the most satisfied were the proud Elvaan, who made their
home in the Kingdom of San d'Oria in the northern reaches of the old continent.
With the Tarutaru monopoly on magic broken, the Elvaan were able to create
powerful orders of knights who feared no adversary.

Beastmen strongholds and Tarutaru villages alike fell before the power of the
knights of San d'Oria. Within a short time, nearly the entire Quon continent
had come under San d’Orian control.

But pride comes before the fall.

The nation of Bastok, founded by the Hume and Galka races, lay on the southern
edge of the Quon continent. Fortified by the growing economic and
intelligence-gathering abilities of the Hume race, Bastokan forces crushed the
elite San d'Orian knights at the Second Battle of Konschtat. Cutting-edge
firearms technology turned the tide of battle and cemented victory for the
people of Bastok. This humiliating defeat sent the Kingdom of San d'Oria into
an age of internal turmoil and civil war. Piece by piece, territories that the
Elvaan had conquered slipped from their grasps.

---The Age of Technology---

The fall of the Kingdom of San d'Oria ushered in an era of prosperity for the
Republic of Bastok.

Hume tradesmen spread across Vana'diel in an unprecedented era of economic
development. Bastok’s fortunes grew as Humes sold products forged from the
precious metals and rare ores extracted from their mines. The trend only
accelerated with the appearance of the engineering genius named Cid. Ever
practical, the Humes set about creating another nation-state: the Grand Duchy
of Jeuno. Jeuno had long been a tiny fishing town on an isolated island between
the two continents. The construction of great bridges transformed the sleepy
village into a teeming metropolis of trade and industry.

---The End of the Age of People---

The one known only as the Shadowlord appeared without warning, and his name
remains synonymous with terror to this day. Consumed by hatred of all living
things, he enslaved the beastmen and employed them in simultaneous attacks
against the nations of Vana'diel. So began the Crystal War.

After years of peace and prosperity, the nations fell one after another,
unable to halt the relentless onslaught. The nightmare spread across the lands
of Vana'diel like hellfire.

In response to the seemingly unstoppable beastmen assault, Grand Duke
Kam'lanaut of Jeuno convinced the people of San d'Oria, Windurst, and Bastok to
unite as the Allied Forces of Altana and defeat the beastmen once and for all.

A stalemate ensued for some time. Finally, at the legendary Battle of Jeuno,
the Allied Forces of Altana were able to gain the upper hand. They claimed
total victory over the beastmen at the merciless Battle of Xarcabard.

Finally, the heroes of the five races cornered the Shadowlord in his stronghold
of Castle Zvahl, where Volker, champion of Bastok, delivered the final coup de
grace.

Thus the Crystal War drew to an end, with victory marred by the uncountable
corpses scattered throughout the devastated lands and cities of Vana'diel.

---The Dawn of the Age of Adventurers---

Although the war had ended, the long-suffering nations of Vana'diel pledged to
maintain their alliance. Each nation built a consulate in their sister
countries. The Duchy of Jeuno unveiled enormous airships based on ancient
technology, bringing the nations of Vana'diel closer together, and promising a
new era of peace and prosperity.

Or so the nations of the world had hoped.

In reality, the beastmen had regrouped and continued to construct strongholds
throughout the world. Although they lacked the organization of previous eras,
they launched a new campaign of looting, plundering, and terror against the
people of Vana'diel.

Still, the three great nations continued to mistrust one another. Rather than
dispatching their own forces to deal with the beastmen threat, they began to
employ a new generation of independent youth to deal with the situation on an
individual level.

These stalwart people are called adventurers. They are intrepid souls who
follow their own beliefs, moving freely from city to city in spite of their own
national allegiances.

Truly, it is the dawn of a new era in Vana'diel history.

CHARACTER CREATION                                           CHARACTER CREATION

The first thing you will have to do when making your character is select the
race you are going to be. The races you can choose include the following:

Hume (Male)       *Human*
Hume (Female)     *Human*
Elvann (Male)     *Elf*
Elvann (Female)   *Elf*
Tarutaru (Male)   *Midget Elfish Character*
Tarutaru (Female) *Midget Elfish Character*
Mithra (Female)   *Catgirls*
Galka (Male)      *Brawny Bear-Like Creatures*

After that you will have to choose out of one of the 8 faces. Each face has a
specific hairstyle for it. After you choose your face, you have to choose a
haircolor. The haircolors are specific to each face. For instance, one face may
let you have red or black hair, while another face may let you have gray or
blonde hair. It all depends. 

After that you have to choose your characters hight for its race. A short
elvann will still be taller than the tallest tarutaru. You can choose for your
character to be "small", "medium", or "large".

Then you have to choose your starting-off job. It is a basic job. You can
change your job at any time you want. You can choose between Warrior, Monk,
Black Mage, White Mage, Red Mage, and Theif. Choosing your job will not change
your path during the game.

Then you have to enter your character name. Nobody else can have to same name
as you. This also means that if a name is already chosen, you cannot take it.
This will be your name for the rest of the game. You cannot change it later on.
It's a hard descision.

Then you have to choose the country you will start off in. You can choose from
the following:

Bastok     - City full of mechienery. Recommended start for the Humes and Galka
San D'Oria - A large castle city. Recommended starting point for the Elvann
Windurst   - Rustic town. Rec. starting point for Tarutaru and Mithra

After you choose your city, you will be thrown into the city and a cutscene
will occur.

Remember that your starting city will affect some of your beginning. The
starting missions you get depend on your city. It will also determine which
country you will work for in the land conquest. You can change your
nationallity later though. Where you start of will also determine which
creatures you will face at the beginning. If you choose the city that is "your
race's city", you will get a ring. It goes like this:

Bastok     - Hume, Galka
San D'Oria - Elvann
Windurst   - Taru Taru, Mithra

Ring Stats:
Bastokian Ring: HP+3 DEX+1 VIT+1
Windhurstian Ring: MP+3 AGI+1 INT+1
San d'Orian Ring: DEF:2 STR+1 MND+1

The rings are also a Rank 3 4000CP item.

RACE DETAILS                                                       RACE DETAILS

HUME
The human race. Completly average in every way. If you want to look like
yourself, then this should be your choice. Since they are mediocre in every
way, they are not the best race. Well, they dont excell at anything is what I
meant to say. Oh well, we are all only human(or hume).

Without Job: HP=28  MP=18  STR=6  DEX=6  VIT=6  AGI=6  INT=6  MND=6  CHR=6

ELVANN
The elfs of Final Fantasy XI. They are not really elfs as you might expect from
LotR or D&D, though. The elvann have high attack power and high mind. They can
attack doing massive damage, and can heal really well. They are not like the
master archers from Lord of the Rings. Their dexterity is not very high.

Without Job: HP=30  MP=16  STR=7  DEX=6  VIT=7  AGI=5  INT=5  MND=7  CHR=6

TARUTARU
Short midget people resembling chipmuncks. They have high MP and high INT
compared to the other races. This allows them to use powerful magic, and a lot
of it. They are what most people would consider your basic "Mage".

Without Job: Hp=24  MP=24  STR=5  DEX=6  VIT=6  AGI=7  INT=8  MND=6  CHR=6

MITHRA
Catgirl-like people. They are a female-only race. They take all the dexterity
from the elvann. Infact, they have the highest DEX and AGI out of any race.
They are also liked by male teenagers for obvious reasons.

Without Job: HP=28  MP=18  STR=6  DEX=8  VIT=6  AGI=7  INT=6  MND=6  CHR=5

GALKA
A hairy bear-like race. Having high HP and might VIT, they can take a lot of
damage. All their faces look very different though. This gives them a lot of
diversity compared to most races. However, despite them being very good, they
are in the minority.

Without Job: HP=33  MP=12  STR=7  DEX=6  VIT=8  AGI=6  INT=6  MND=6  CHR=5

04-The Basics


---Stats And What They Stand For---

Stats affect all of FFXI:O. The better stats you have, the better you can
survive and find a party. People want strong parties.
*******************************************************************************

LV - Your job level of the current job. Once you "Level Up" your stats increse.

HP - Your character's health. Once you lose all of it then you will die.
     Without HP you cannot preform any action except for talking to someone
     else. So in short, don't lose this.

MP - Your character's "mana". Once you lose all of it then you cannot use
     magic anymore. If you are a mage then this is very important.

NOTE: Your HP and MP get recovered in small increments while you are resting.

TP - Tactical Point. Once you get your TP meter to 100% it let's you use a
     weapon skill if you want. You can get the meter up to 300% percent. The
     more TP, the better your weapon skills. More is explained in the Weapon
     Skill section of the FAQ.

STR - The strength of your character. The more STR you have, the higher you
      physical attack damage will do. Needed for melee classes.

DEX - Your characters dexterity, meaning how fast and how accurate your attacks
      are.

VIT - You vitality meaning how much damage you can take. The more VIT you have,
      the less amount of damage you take from a normal attack.

AGI - The agility of your charcater, or how fast your character can move. The
      better AGI means the more you can evade attacks and so on. May affect how
      accurate you are, but I am not currently sure.

INT - Intelligence and how much your Black Magic does. Have a high amount of
      this and you can blow enemies away with spells. Need a high number if you
      are going to be a powerful mage.

MND - Mind affects three things and is very useful. It affects how good your
      defense against magic is, determines how well you resist abnormal status,
      and your White Magic power.

CHR - Charisma affects a bards songs and other charisma related attacks. For
      the class abilities it may have a (C) next to it meaning that charisma
      affects it.

EXP - The amount of experience points you have accumulated the entire game.
      They don't have a purpose really, except that you can show it off to your
      friends. If you die you will lose a small portion of it.

NEXT Level - Amount of exp. needed to gain the next Job Level.

*Fame* - Fame affects the amount of pricing in stores. The more fame you have,
         the less money things cost in stores. You can get more fame by
         completing quests.

*Hate* - Hate determines the chance that an enemy will attack you. Casting
         spells and the use of certain abilities will temporarily boost this
         stat.

NOTE: Fame is not shown in the status screen. An NPC can tell you the number.
NOTE: Hate is not shown in the status screen. An NPC can tell you the number.

NPCs that will tell you what your fame is in that area:
  Bastok (Port)        |  E-6  |  Flaco
  Jeuno (Lower)        |  H-8  |  Mendi
  Kazham               |  I-11 |  Ney Hiparujah
  Norg                 |  H-8  |  Vaultimand
  Rabao                |  G-9  |  Waylea
  San d'Oria (South)   |  K-6  |  Namonutice
Windurst (Waters)    |  F-10 |  Zabirego-Hajigo



*******************************************************************************


---Stats Effects And What They Stand For---

Stats effects are good and bad things. There are good status effects will will
increase your chance of victory by making you stronger. Bad status effects are
effects that will make you suffer. You will probably know what I mean.

NOTE: The above was in relation to your character or party. If a good status
      effect is cast on an enemy (like Haste), that is bad for you. Hopefully
      that wasn't too confusing.
*******************************************************************************

Bad Status Effects:

NOTE: Sorry, but it will be in the next update. I am pressed for time so I
      decided to start this section.

---Tips For You When You Play The Game---

Just follow these simple tips and you will have a much more fun time in FFXI:O

1) Be Courteous-
        Americans as a whole are not known for their politeness, especially on
        online games. When you play do not say things like "G|V3 m3 50m3
        G||_". Instead say something like "Could you spare some gil". Whether
        you would like to think about it or not, people WILL give you gil or
        something else if you ask nicely. Also ask someone if you can view
        their stats before you do it. Since whenever someone views your stats
        (or theirs) it will tell them. They could get mad. Just be courteous
        and polite to everyone and you will succeed in this game. "Courtesy is
        the key of life"

2) Desperation-
        Nearly everyone you will find throughout the world of FFXI:O will be in
        search of a party. Since you NEED to party up at the higher levels,
        than look for someone with a little exclamation mark over their head.
        Ask them nicely if they want to join in your "party" (even if you are
        currently solo) and they will probably say "yes".

3) Do NOT Charge-
        For any services in the game you do, do not make people pay for them.
        What I mean by this is that if you heal someone do not ask them for a
        donation. Also dont charge people to have you in their party. You will
        never advance in the game. "If you are a White Mage then it is your
        duty to heal those in need" - White Mage Handbook, vol.6

4) Ask Game Masters-
        Game Masters (GMs) wander around the world of FFXI:O and act much like
        a police force. Any inappropriate behavior in front of a Game Master
        and they may suspend your account for a small amount of time. You can
        swear and the sort, but do not do it at someone. Basically no foul
        language and you will be safe throughout the game. Also, if you have a
        question then ask a GM. GMs will answer most question you ask them. It
        might be a "I don't want to spoil any surprizes so I cant answer that"
        or a "to get to Selbina go south of Valkurm Dunes" type of answer. GMs
        are very nice in the end if you are polite. The only thing you should
        not do is constantly talk to GMs. They can suspend you for distracting
        them and so on. You can talk to GMs, but just dont do it excessievly.

5) Follow Your Duty-
        If you are in a party then do your responsibility. The party leader
        will most likely give you plans for each battle you go up against. Most
        likely if the leader is a good leader he will know what and what not to
        do. Listen to him or her. He may want to try and get a few Magic Bursts
        or Skillchains out successfully. If you do not listen then other
        parties may not want you ever in thier party. You probably won't make a
        new friend or that person may not trust you again if you act badly in a
        battle. Do your best and listen to the leaders orders.

6) Form A Good Party-
        Do not make a party of just one class. It will not work out. Parties
        have to be balanced and have to have a lot of variety to succeed. If
        you are the leader then make a good party and decide when you should
        use certain moves. Request help if needed, but never leave your
        party hanging.

7) It Doesn't Matter-
        If you do everything you were supposed to do in a battle and you
        die, it is not all bad. By dying you may make a new friend.
        Really, it's happened. If everything doesn't go to plan just joke about
        it. Life is all good if you make it be.

8) Just Hang Out-
        Life in FFXI:O isn't about just killing off hoardes of enemies and
        getting good stuff. Just have a fun time doing whatever you want. Talk
        to people that you met two months ago and check how they are doing. Go
        and check out the many beauties of Vana'deil and every place you can
        find. While if you die you will loose experience, sometimes it is just
        fun seeing how long you can last or put yourself in danger. This is not
        real life. Well it could be, but just chill. There is a whole world of
        things to do out there.

---There must be an easier way---

You can simply do things by way of your keyboard. I will go into the way you
use them later. I completely recommend anyone playing FFXI to get a keyboard.
It is practically needed if you want to get anywhere. After playing this game
for 2 days without the keyboard, you will want one really badly. You can use
any USB keyboard that isn't broken.

05-Conquest


---Have Your Kingdom Take Over All Of The Land---

All kingdoms of Vana'deil are trying to take all territory from the other
countries. Depending on the kingdom you were born in your character will be
"working for that kingdom". Getting your kingdom more land results in more
trading in your country and more. You will also have to work against the
beastmen But how do you do it? Go to a guard and talk to him so that he will
cast Signet on you. This will allow you to kill things and get points twords
your country. Whenever you kill off creatures in some areas you will gain
points for you country. These points can be used to acuire certain things. The
more people in that section that die will hurt the country that owns it so make
sure you dont die, or let someone else die. Make your country prosper. That
way, even white mages can help.

---The History of Conquest---

Let us take a brief look at the historical origins of the conquest in
Vana'diel. Although there has been a marked decrease in large-scale coordinated
attacks from the beastmen since the end of the Crystal War, constant sweeps are
required to hunt down wandering bands of beastmen that threaten small villages
and travelers.

Yet the nations of Vana'diel are exhausted from the war, and continue to harbor
doubts about their allies. As such, they are reluctant to dispatch large
numbers of their own troops to deal with the problem.

Troubled by the situation, Grand Duke Kam'lanaut of the Grand Duchy of Jeuno
proposed the conquest system. This awards the right to control a region to the
nation that contributed the most to ensure its safety. As the nation of Jeuno
is a crossroads of trade and does not desire any further territory of its own,
it acts as the impartial judge and sponsor of the conquest.

The representatives of the three great nations of Vana'diel gathered in
Selbina, and agreed that a force was needed to deal with the beastmen scourge.
The representatives signed the "Selbina Pact for Conquest." Since then, each
nation's border guards have been authorized to deputize adventurers of the same
allegiance to participate in the conquest. This has ushered in a new era in the
history of Vana'diel: the Age of Adventurers.

06-Missions+Quests


---Non-Linear, The Way To Go---

Misssions and quests are little activities you can do outside of fighting.
Missions and Quests are both very different and both very alike. One reason
they are different is because Missions advance the story you are leading in
Vana'diel, whereas Quests are just something you can do if you want that wont
affect the world. Quests are very good to do though. Quests can give you better
stuff, new classes, gil, experience, or magic. You do not have to do quests or
misssions though if you choose not to. You will just not get as much out of the
game if that is what you decide to do. Quests and missions are usually worth
the time to finish them. In the case of quests, you can decide to do one. It is
put on your quest log. You do not have to do quests in a certain amount of
time, unless the "quest giver says so.

---I'M Popular!---

By doing lost of quests you can accumulate Fame. Fame lowers the price of
things in stores. The more quests you do, the lower things will cost. Obviously
this does not lower the price of the things in the bazzar, otherwise someone
could put something for the price of 1600 and you could get it off of them for
maybe 1200. Then they would not be happy...I think. A nice benefit. Think of it
in this setting: Lets say you want to get a new sword costing 1100. You have 0
gil right now. You do a quest and get fame and 1000 gil. But now the sword has
gone down to 1000 gil instead of the previous price of 1100. Now you can get
it.

07-Classes


---Many Jobs---

The classes in FFXI:O are very unique to any MMORPG out there. While you do
choose one class to start out as, you have the ability to change you class at
your moghouse. No matter what race you are, you can pick any class. ALL classes
have a special purpose and there is no overpowering classes. Each Class has its
own level. This means that if you were leveling in White Mage, then you would
not be getting any better at being a Black Mage.

NOTE: Classes are referred to as Jobs in the world of FFXI.

Basic Classes - Basic Classes are the Jobs you start out from the beginning
                with.

*******************************************************************************

Warrior - A basic fighter in every way. Most people like if for its ability to
          taunt the enemy.

Monk - With its high HP it makes a pretty good class. Weak armor is its
       disadvantage.

Black Mage - Good at high damaging spells, but has weak armor and low HP.
             FIRE!!! HA HA HA!!! - Crazy Black Mage

White Mage - The main healer of the game. Heal everyone who needs healing is
             the White Mage way.

Red Mage - The most average class, a jack of all trades. Can do a bit of Black
           Magic, a bit of White, and a bit of sword attacks too.

Thief - The fastest class in the game with the ability to steal. Not
        recommended in real life.

*******************************************************************************

Advanced Classes - Classes that require you to do a quest when one of your jobs
is level 30 or higher. They are not any better than a basic class, but they
will help, and I mean it. They have different specialties then the basics
making them useful. In most cases though, they are not good as a sub-job.

*******************************************************************************

Paladin - With a hight defense (but low str) and its small amount of white
          magic, what more can I say...

Dark Knight - An exact opposite of the Paladin. High attack low defense and
              some black magic.

Bard - A good support (not sub-job) class that uses NO MP.

NOTE: Although a Bard by definition is only supposed to be male, bards can be
      female.

Summoner - A mage that has the ability to Summon gods to aid them in battle.

Beast Master - An average fighter that can tame beasts to attack the opponent
               for a short while.

Ranger - A class that uses long range attacks as its specialty. Need lots of
         gil for arrows, or need to be good at making arrows.

Samurai - A warrior that can fend off demons and gain TP quickly.

Ninja - They can throw weapons and duel weild making them a great STR booster.

Dragoon - A warrior of the Dragons. Can have a Wyvern following him and can
          jump into the heavens. Also known as Dragon Knights.

ADVANCED JOB QUESTS                                         ADVANCED JOB QUESTS

---PALADIN---

The quest for Paladin is fairly easy. It is given by the NPC Balasiel in south
San'Doria. He is residing on the bridge. The first thing to give to him is a
root. This foot can be obtained from most undead enemies. Next you have to go
to the ordellas cave in La Thine. Go to location (G-7) and there will be a
small pool of water. Touch the ???, then touch another ??? which is located not
to far from the pool. The spot to touch the ??? is about 15 - 25 steps
(depending on your race) from the pool. You will receive a item if done
correctly. Lastly talk to Balasiel (the guy you talked to to obtain the quest),
then talk to the guards on 2nd floor of the guard post east and west
Cahaurme(J-9) & Baurise(H-9). Then go to Davoi (E10) and examine the disussed 
well and get an item. Go to Balasiel (again) and you an get a Lv 28 Kite
Shield, and you can change your job to a lv 1 Paladin.

---DARK KNIGHT---

The quest to be a Dark Knight is an easy one. You can do it as a lv 1 warrior
if you wanted(as long as you have lv 30 in another job). However, you must be a
warrior to do the quest. That does not mean you have to be a lv 30 warrior, it
just mean you have to complete the quest having warrior as your main job. Talk
to Gumbah (Bastok Mines J-7)get the quest. Then go to the 3rd floor of
Palbrough Mines (G-8). Get on the ship back to town and after the ride in the
Zerhaun mines you'll recieve a 2 handed sword called the Chaos Bringer(?).
Equip the sword and kill 100 of any type of enemies without leaving the area.
After the 100 or more kills goto the person named Beadeaux located at the
Southeast exit of the Pashhow Marshland and you get Dark knight. Now start
working on your lv 1 Dark Knight. Dark Knight is, in my opinion, the coolest
job ever.

---BEAST MASTER---

Talk to Dietmund in Lower Jueno (G-11). He will come out as soon as you open
the door. Wait until it is nighttime (20:00-04:00). Go to a edge of the cliff
in Qufim (F-8). Follow the path down the cliff to the edge. At the bottom,
click on Night Flowers which will be glowing white like they do at night time.
Go back to Dietmund, then talk to the chocobo house owner (Brutus) at Upper
Jeuno to obtain the Beast Master job.

---RANGER---

Talk to Perih Vashai in the Windurst Woods (K-7). Go to (L-10) of Zoromugh
Hills. Wait until the Old Sabertooth dies naturally and click on the Tiger
Bones. Take the item you get from the bones to Perih Vashai and he will give
you the Ranger job.

---BARD---

Talk to Mertaire, Bki Tbujhja, Ruslan and Tuh Almobankha in Lower Jueno. Then
go to to Mhaura and buy a paper from Pikini-Mikini at a Warehouse (G-9). The
paper will cost you 500 gil. Get out of Mhaura to Buburimu and head to location
(G-9). You can get there through a cave from the main beach. You will find a
Song Rune. Click on song rune and trade the paper to the Runes. Then go back to
Mertaitre in lower jueno. Then go to Valkurm Dunes and at the northwest point
you will see a secret cave, pass through and you will end up at a beach. Find
another Song Rune there. Click on the Song Rune. After the cut scene you'll
recieve some gil and obtain the singing Bard job. I dont want to see another
song rune again.

---SAMURAI---

Speak with Jaucribaix in Norg. He wants a branch from a tree in a sacred place
and iron filings from a bomb. Talk to Ranemaud to receive a sacred tree
sapling. Now, talk to Aeka to receive old iron from the east. The next two
parts can be done in any order.

Trade the old iron to the ??? point at the far west of Konschtat Highlands
(D8). A bomb enemy, Forger, will appear. Kill it and you will receive the iron
fillings. Even if you fight this bomb with a party, it will only drop 1 item,
and you can only trade iron to the ??? every 3 minutes.

Use an axe at the ??? point on the huge tree at the west side of The Sanctuary
of Zi'Tah. A Walking Tree enemy, Guardian Treant, will appear. Kill it and
examine the ??? again to receive the branch.

Return to Jaucribaix with these items. After you give him them, he will tell
you to come back in three days (3 hours). Come back and you will receive the
Samurai job class and an Unsigned Sword. You can now change to Samurai in your
Mog House.

---DRAGOON---

First, go to "Cargo Room A" (I-10) in Port Sandoria. Then speak to Arminibit
and Ceraulian. Enter the Chateau d'Oraguille then down the path at (I-8) to
Bostaunieux Oubliette. Enter the first path that's to the right to meet
Novalmauge. Go to the Cathedral in Northern San Doria(L-7) and speak with
Morjean to recieve the quest from Oiheaurese. After receiving the quest, go to
the Auction house and buy some Pickaxe for excavating purpose. Now head to the
Maze of Shakrami to excavate at the "Excavation Point" (G-7),(I-6), etc., not
"Fossil Rock", for a "Dragon Egg". Go back to Cathedral and speak with Morjean.
You should then accept the quest given by Yachemidot. Go to the Meriphataud
Mountains. To the east at (K-8) will be the end of the Drogaroga's Spine. There
will be a "???" there. Trade the egg to the "???" and an event will occur. Go
back to Sandoria and enter Chateau d'Oraguille. Then enter into Royal Knights'
Quarters(H-9) and speak to Rahal and receive a key item. After receiving the
key item, go to Ghelsba Outpost. Locate the "Hide Door"(G-10) in the Ghelsba
Outpost and defeat the Dragon. The daron is behind the dorr, and only one party
can fight it at a time. Bring a good party(6 people)of lv 45s to take it down.

---NINJA---

To start off, you need to talk to Kaede in a house located in Port Bastok
(I-5). Then head into the warehouse in Port Bastok (F-5) and speak to Kagetora.
Go back to the house where Kaede is (I-5), and goto the room to the left. In
there you have to speak to Ensetsu. Now go to Bastok Mines. Then go to Zeruhn
Mines, and then to Korroloca Tunnel to (A-9) and you'll be transferred over to
(N-8) on the same map. Now head over to (G-8) then you'll be transferred over
to (I-11) of the same map. Now head over to (K-8) and there will be a ???. Get
ready and click on it to fight 3 Korroloca Leech (Leech type NM), You may want
to clear the area of Thread Leech's since they will start attacking you if they
see you are fighting the Korroloca Leechs. After the fight click on the ??? to
recieve a key item. Now head back to Ensetsu in Port Bastok (I-5) and head to
the new area Norg and speak to Ryoma to complete the quest.

---SUMMONER---

To get the summoner advanced job, you first have to go to Windurst Walls (G3).
When you get there, talk to the taru Ajido-Marujido. After that, go kill any
kind of leech creature that you want. You have to get the Ruby from it, but you
will only get it as a drop if your level is above 30. You have a small chance
of getting it quickly (1% drop rate). Now goto the House of the Hero in
Windurst Walls. Investigate the door with the stone in your item list. After
that, experience the 7 different weather conditions. You only have to have the
weather effect on your map. You have to experience areas that are Pleasant,
have Fire, Ice, Earth, Water, Wind, and Lightning, but not all at once. After
you have experienced those elements, head to La Theine Plateau. There is a
stone circle there. Target ??? and trade the stone into it. You will now obtain
the Summoner job and your first summon which should be obvious after the quest.

*******************************************************************************

---The Specifics---

These are everything you will ever need to know about a job. Including starting
stats, max stats, a short summary, abilities, qualities, and how useful they
are in a party. Remember that all jobs are balenced and that there is not a
best out of all of these. Note that this is not the order you would see the 
jobs if you were switching jobs. This is also if you decided to not have any
sub-jobs attached. So, with a sub-job, these will have much more different
stats.

*  = Abilities that do not carry over when this job is a sub-job
R: = Recharge Time - How long it takes before you can use the ability again
D: = Duration Time - How long the ability effects last after you use it
Instant = Attack is exectuted right away

NOTE: Time is in real time, not Vana'diel time.

1 hr real time = 1 day game time

---Summary---

Warriors are your average fighters. They are the job that is made for combat.
Warrior is a very good starting job. It has good STR and VIT, and can equip a
lot of things. The ability to provoke is very useful later on as a paladin and
as a ninja. Berserk and warcry are both good abilities to use if you sub it
when being a Dark Knight.

---Summary---

The Black Mage is a very good class. It is the class with no magical equal. It
is needed in most parties later on. Its attacks are more powerful than any
physical fighting class. It will however needed to be gaurded at all costs.
This is your basic casting class. Low heath/defense, but high magical power.
Remember, if you are this class, your are what decides the outcome of the
battle...generally.

---Summary---

Red Mages are a jack of all trades. They can use a bit of black magic, a bit of
white, some of its own magic, and holds his or her own with a sword. While it
may not be the best mage, it can be a powerful one. It will be able to cast
faster than a normal mage, but its magic will be slightly hindered. It can use
its own magic that will enchant weapons. This will allow you to always be
attacking a creature with the opposing elements. A hume red mage is the most
balenced class in FFXI. What a red mage mainly does is fill in a spot that
needs to be filled for the party. Although they are considered a jack of all
trades, a Red Mage in FFXI has the highest skill in Enhancing in the whole
game.

---Summary---

Thieves are a really good job. While they start off being one of the worst
classes, they become really good. They can hit for the most damage. While not
recommended in real life, the staling ability leaves thiefs with a lot of money
in the end. Also they get a speed enhancing move. How good is that!

---Summary---

Paladin's are the defender of holy, the warriors of light, and the protectors
of all that is good. Actually, a Paladin is a really good job. What they
specialize in is high defense and white magic to some degree. They are not
attackers by any means. Infact, Paladins' should provoke the enemy all the
time. Their invincible skill is especially good for this. It will make the
enemy never stop attacking you. All you will need to do is heal and defend as a
Paladin. Believe me. With this strategy, you will always get accepted into
Parties. The Warrior's "Defender" Job Ability may come in handy. Dont plan to
get invited into PTs if you dont have a Warrior subjob.

---Summary---

Everything that a Paladin is not. Infact, Dark Knights are the exact opposite
of Paladins. Instead of defending and taking all the damage, Dark Knights
should always attack doing high damage. They have some black magic to aid them
too. Their defense is way too low to be attacked a lot, though. A Dark
Knight's main responsibility is to keep attacking the opponent doing the most
damage possible. A Dark Knight will really shine (in a Demonic sort of way) at
Lv60 when it can get the weapon skill "Guillotine". This is a super-powerful
scythe weapon skill.

Bards are the main supporters of a party. They sing songs(magic section)that do
many different effects. Most of their songs help the whole party. They can
heal, do damage, and buff(boost stats)the whole party. Bards are second to
White Mages as the most important members in a party. You wont have much
trouble finding a party if you are a Bard. Oh, the coolest part about being a
bard is that you can hear the songs you sing. Do-dou-de-dou-dou-de-dou-di-dou.
Dou-de-dou-de-do-dou-de-doude-doude-do.

---Summary---

Beastmasters are the masters of soloing. Infact, they are a solo-er's dream.
With a baestmaster, what you will be doing is capturing monsters and battling
with them. Sounds like Poke'mon right. Wrong! After a while your tamed creature
will leave and start attacking you. And you cant hold multiple of them either.
However, as a beastmaster, you will never have to look for a party(unless you
are going on a mission). But, mind you, this is easily the worst sub-job.

---Summary---

Let me start of by saying this -- Rangers are an expansive job. They are easily
the most costing job. However, they are also the most melee damage-doing job.
They are the archer for FFXI. all their arrows/bullets cost a lot of money. You
should be expecting 8 gil for each arrow at the beginning, and 500 gil for each
bullet. While they are great, you better have a large amount of gil for this
job. You should probably have skills in the theif for gil purposes, and
carpenter skills for arrow-making purposes, if you want to be a ranger.
None-the-less, they are awesome.

---Summary---

Defenders of the 1700's in Japan, the Samurais' would defend what was right.
Now, in the 21st century, they fight demons and kill things with weapon skills.
A Samurai is best with his weapon skills. What a Samurai is good at is using
Weapon Skills fast and easy. You will be able to gain it faster, and store it.
Its stats are okay though.

What make the Dragoon the coolest job is it's Wyvern. It's Wyvern can fight,
heal, or use certain Wyvern breaths depending on what general type of job your
sub-job is. It could use a healing breath if you are a Dragoon/White Mage, or
Infact, the whole reason to use a Dragoon is for its Wyvern. As you lv up it
gets stronger. It even has its own name. However, you cannot have two wyverns
out at the same time. Oh, well. Dragoons are plentiful though.

---Summary---

The main point of a Ninja is their duel-weild abilities. It allows them to
weild two 1-handed swords at once. The also are great parted with a theif. And,
if you are in a dire situation, just use Self Sacrifice. You will do lots of
damage, and not loose exp. In later levels just remember to travel with someone
who knows the White Magic spell "Raise", "Raise 2", or Raise 3". 

Their second purpose is a unique one. They can become the ultimate tank.
However, they have to use a lot of money to use their skills because they have
to buy the skill every time they want to use it. They can make themselves
invincible with constant stacks of Utsesemi: Ichi/Ni, but at the loss of a lot
of gil. I recommend that you have a lot of gil if you want to be a tank.

---Summary---

Summoner is also a class a lot of people seem to like. However, know this.
Unless you have a good bard with MP regeneration spells, you will only want to
use a summon like a Black magic spell. You summon it and use a skill, then
bring it back. After you bring it back you might want to use Black Mage/White
Mage magic. Atleast, that is the best way to be a summoner. But dont worry. It
is a cool job none-the-less.

08-Server


---What's a Server?---

Servers are seperate gameworlds that you play on. There is no difference in
gameplay on each server. The only change from server to server is the people
playing on them. The servers can hold a maximum of 20,000 players. Servers are
randomly chosen for the players, but if you want to play with your friend there
is a way to do it. 

FunFact: Servers are named after summons from the Final Fantasy series

---World Passes and World Shifters---

A world pass is something that a player already playing the game can get. They
have to buy it in-game, with in-game money. The more people in a server makes a
World Pass cost more. When someone is making a new character, if they enter the
World Pass code from a World Pass, then they start off in the World Pass
giver's server. A World Shifter is an NPC that looks a lot like a GM. They
allow you to move to a smaller server, but you dont get to choose which one.
However, they do tell you which one you will go on before they send you there.
Note that World Shifters only appear on highly populated servers or at
certain special times.

NPCs that give World Passes: 

Kacheda in Port Bastok       - Bastok
Ambleon in Port San D'Oria   - San D'Oria
Gamimi in the Windurst Tower - Windurst

but it is very cool having one. You will feel like you are really your own
group and may be recognised as one of the greatest or largest linkshells ever.
Not everyone gets a name like that! Okay, it sounds somewhat corny but when
your are in a linkshell (or the leader of one) then you will get to know and
meet many more people. Maybe even make some new friends you never knew existed.
That is the bueaty of MMORPGs.

---You Can Be In Many---

You can be in as many linkshells as you want. You could have 2+ linkpearls, but
you can only have 1 equipped. Just a minor note. Basically, to put it simply,
you can be part of multiple linkshells. Just remember that each linkpearl takes
up one space in your inventory.

---How Do I Make One?---

Many people want to make their own linkshells, but it doesn't always works out.
You can find linkshells at shops. Yes, you have to buy one. It will cost about
8000 gil. You cannot get a linkshell by questing. When you get one you have to
give the linkpearls a color. Linkpearls are objects that allow you to
communicate with all of your linkshell members (if they are playing). You can
choose out of the default colors or you own color. When you are walking
around normally you will see the link color to the left of your name unless you
have a Party Invite sign or another various sign next to your head. After you
choose a color you can now give out the pearls. Only the people with pearls
will be a part of your linkshell. You can hand out pearls to anyone that you
want to be in your linkshell. You start of with 64 pearls (not including the
one that you have).

If you have a linkshell it is highly recommended that you have your own website
for it. Tell your link members about the website so that you can plan meetings
or events for your linkshell.

---How Did He Get In???---

If a member of the linkshell is annoying you or other members, you are allowed
to kick them out of your linkshell. If you are a leader or sub-leader, then you
have the ability to kick a member out. Just type /kick [player name] and the
linkpearl that they are holding will shatter. Just amke sure you dont kick the
wrong person out. A person can NOT call a GM on you because you kicked them
out. This isn't elementary school, folks.

---Goodbye---

If you want to get rid of your linkshell then you have the option (if you are
the creater) to break a linkpearl. When you break one then all of the other
members of your linkshell will have no linkshell. If the pressure is getting to
you then why not break it up? You may want to break it up if you are leaving
the game for a while. Whatever your reason is...

10-Guilds


--Couple Things To Do Besides Lving Up---

You can do a lot in FFXI besides lving up. Guilds however are something very
fun and neat to do all of FFXI. Become a master of craftsworking, jewelry, or
leaterworking. Use the crystals to forge powerful armor and weapons. You can
get better at guilds and develop your strengths in each one. You can be a part
of all guilds. However, you will need money to join some of them.

While I guilds that are good for a certain job, it doesnt mean that a certain
job cant join. It just simply means that the guild would be ideal to join if
you were that job. The other thing I will say is that most guilds are good for
players that are not that class. For instance, a mage is not really suggested
if you are blacksmith. Mages wear light armor and weapons while blacksmith is
for making all for these heavy things. However, you will make lots of gil
being a blacksmith and can afford more spells. It is just something good to
know.

You do not equip guilds for each job. You have to get these guild for your
character. They will stay with you nomatter if you change it or not.

Equipment to help get the items:

Field Tunica-
DEF=2 (Body)
Lv1 (All Jobs)
Improves Mining, Logging, and Harvesting

Worker Tunica-
DEF=12 (Body)
Lv15 (All Jobs)

---Cast Your Lines---

Fishing is a simple timewaster. All you have to do is wait until you catch or
dont catch something. Then nomatter what your outcome, you will have to wait
about 10 seconds before you can fish again. You need a fishing rod equipped as
your ranged weapon and bait as your ammo.

There are some armors that will let you fish better than you normally can.
These armors are:

Fisherman's Tunica-
DEF=2 (Body)

---Ching! Clank! Clunk!---

Blacksmiting is the process of making objects out of metal. This guild is good
for those that want to be making heavy armor and heavy weaponry. In short, it
is for a warrior and anyone with a craving to get hit or give hits with hunks
of steel.

---Well...I Would Not Call That Gold---

Goldsmithing is basically jewerly. It is making things like earrings and rings.

---Pass Me My Trowel---

Carpentering is making things out of wood. Many people join in it to make
arrows because they will eventually become a Ranger and they dont want to have
to buy arrows which are very costly. The other use for this is to make
furniture for your house. While it may not be good for battle, houses are
cool. The other things this class is good for is staves, bows, and some spears
can be made here.

---Make Me An Antidote...QUICK!---

---It Is My Big Yellow Chicken/Ostrich---

Chocoboing isnt really a guild. But that doesnt mean you cannot use them.
Chocobos have many uses. They can dig things up from out of the ground and they
can be used to travel fast and aviod enemies. But the thing I will say is that
it will run away from you after a certain amount of time.

To dig, you will need some gyshel greens. I dont know what comes out of digging
so I need to experiment. 

There are some armors that will let you ride a chocobo for a longer period of
time. These armors are:

Chocobo Jack Coat-
DEF=2 (Body)
Lv1 (All Jobs)
Chocobo Riding Time+5

Rider's Jack Coat-

11-Magic


---Healing...Hurting...Magic---

There are many types of magic in FFXI. Most magic requires MP. When you cast a
spell there is delay while you chant a spell. You have to wait for the chanting
to be over to be able to cast your spell.  Chanting can somtimes be stopped by
a normal phisical attack. The types of Magic are Black Magic, White Magic,
Summon Magic and Songs. Black Magic is attacking magic ranging from lightning
attacks to setting your self on fire so that when creatures attack you, they
will get hurt. White Magic is the healing Magic and status affecting magic.
White Magic can revive a wandering traveler, or it can poison a goblin thug.
Summons are mystical beasts that attack your opponent until you call them back,
or your MP runs out. For every second your summon is out you loose MP. Songs
are another story though. Songs, unlike Black/White Magic, dont require any MP.
Songs can actually be heard. I mean that you can actually hear the song being
sung. Songs are the stat-boosting, hurting, and healing spells. Basically
Singing is both weak healing and weak hurting.<-Heh...so true.

---Im Leveling Up...But Not Gaining Any Spells---

There is only a very specific way of getting spells. In FFXI you actually have
to buy your spells. However, you can only use spells if you are a high enough
level in your job. You can gain spells by buying them, questing for them, or by
having someone trade them to you.

---You Need Magic---

During the start of the game when you are not partying, you will not need a
person with magic in your group. However, once you get far enough, you will
need magic to get by. A Black Mage and Back Magic are needed to kill of hordes
of enemies. A White Mage and White Magic are needed to heal wandering
travelers. It is as simple as that. You cannot kill any creatures with physical
attacks alone later in the game. Magic is far more powerful that your swords.

---Magic Against Other Magic---

Magic goes in a big circle I will call the "Magic Wheel". The Magic Whell tells
what type of magic is good/bad against other magic types. Elements are what
make the world go round'.

- First Wheel -

 Fire > Ice
 Ice > Wind
 Wind > Ground
 Ground > Thunder
 Thunder > Water
 Water > Fire

- Second Wheel -

 Dark > Light
 Light > Dark

The second wheel is a bit more confusing. It basically says that Dark does good
damage against Light, and light does good against dark.

NOTE: Silence will make it not possible to cast spells or sing songs.

---How Do I Raise My Stats Besides Lving---

To raise a characters stats without leveling is fairly easy. You just have to
equip something like a weapon or armor. Weapons raise your attacking, while
armor raises your defense. If you have played any RPG for the most part, you
should know what equipment is.

E-Mail me for any questions about the weapons.

NOTE: Some weapons have long names and do not fit on the chart. That is why
      some weapons have to be read right, or you may get confused. ie: look at
      the Legionnaire's Knuckles in the hand-to-hand section.

You can equip 1 piece of armor from each section on your character. This doesnt
include earrings and rings, which you can equip two of. 

E-Mail me for any questions about the armors.

NOTE: Some armors have long names and do not fit on the chart. That is why some
      armors have to be read right, or you may get confused. ie: look at
      the Royal Footman's Tunic in the body armor section.

ARTIFACT EQUIP                                                   ARTIFACT EQUIP

AF equip is the only completly Job-specific armor/weapons with a few
exceptions. AF stands for artifact. Why is it called artifact? Mainly because
it comes from previous FF games. What I mean by this is that the White Mage AF
armor looks like a 3-D version of the armor the White Mage that was in Final
Fantasy (1), Final Fantasy V, Final Fantasy III, or Final Fantasy Tactics. To
put it simply, it looks like what we think of a White Mage (or any FF class) to
look like. (White Mage AF is a white Robe with red triangles, basically) It is
not the most powerful armor you can get for that class, but it is really good
and you look pretty cool. This chart might be a bit hard to read, (due to a lot
of extra stuff) but bear with me. I did not compile this data. It was RPGdemon
and a few others (listed at bottom of section and in the special thanks) that
put this list together, so it may be comfusing in many places. It is not their
fault, nor am I putting the blame on them, it is just that many people have
many different styles of doing things.

13-Weapon Skill


---Somewhat Like The Limit Breaks Of FFXI---

Weapon skills are one of the very neat aspects of FFXI. They add a whole new
element of gameplay in FFXI that no other MMORPG has had. As you use your
weapon more you upgrade your skill in a certain weapon. By upping this skill in
a weapon, you learn Weapon Skills. Note that depending on jobs, some weapon
skills cannot be used even though the weapon skill level is accumulated. Weapon
skills can later be combined if timed right. For more info on WS combination
look at the "Special Effects" section of the FAQ.

---When Can I Use One---

You can use your weapon skills when your TP (tactical Point) Gauge is filled
up. When it is filled up to atleast 100% you can use it. When the meater is
more than 100% sometimes an added effect is added on. These added effects range
from more damage to adding poison to the damage. The max a TP bar can go up to
is 300%. After that it cannot progress until it goes lower. When you use a
Weapon Skill your TP meter returns back to 0%.

14-Special Effects


---Unique To This Game---

Special Effects are unique to this game. No other online game has had them.
They add another unique element to gameplay--strategy. Well, to some degree.
You have to time out your moves so well to execute one of these. You will know
what I mean later.

---A Chain Of Weapon Skills---

A Skillchain is a group of Weapon Skills that have to be executed right after
each other to work. When two or more Weapon Skills are used right after another
one they are called a Skillchain (or Renkei in the Japanese version). By using
this "Skillchain" you combine Weapon Skills and make more powerful versions
with added effects. It is a very hard thing to understand and a very hard
concept to learn. This section will be huge when I go into the theory part of
it and so on.

SKILLCHAINS                                                         SKILLCHAINS

NOTE: Coming In Next Update (Hopefully)
*******************************************************************************

---Boosting My Magic Power---

The element of Magic Burst is a neat one. It is much like a skillchain in a
way. However, it is much harder to execute. You have to time when your spell
will activate since magic has casting times.

15-Moghouse


---The Only Real Way To Live...In A House---

In FFXI you can get your very own house. It is called a moghouse. Moghouses get
their name because it is a house with a moogle in it. Moogles are sometimes
called mogs. You can decorate your house and grow plants in it. However, the
most important thing you can do there has to do with your moogle.

---Moogle Time---

Moogles in FFXI are one of the most important things. When you talk to your
moogle you have many options. If you are growing a plant you can go to your
moogle to preserve it so it stays in that condition. You can use your moogle as
a bank. You talk to it if you want to decorate your house. You can even change
your job and sub-job in it. They are really important, and really cool.

---The Elements Of A Mog House---

As of the February 2004 update, moghouse furniture now has elements
accociated to it. 

---My House Is Cool, Can I Go To My Friend's House?---

The answear to this is "NO". However you may be able to go into a friends house
in the future. I have divised a way for it to work.
Here is what you do.
 
*When you go into your moghouse, you select the new command "Mogport".
*Each Moghouse has a specific 10-digit number.
*When you select "Mogport", you type in the number of your friends moghouse.
*If the moghouse you you want to go in has the player offline, it fails.
*If they are playing, then the game will tell you to wait.
*On the other end, it will ask if player so-and-so can enter your moghouse.
*If the other player says yes, you can go in.
*If they say no, it fails.
*In the moghouse, you can only look around and job-switch.
*Works across multiple servers.
 
Hopefully, you like the idea. Just tell me if you think you can improve it or
if you think it is great.

NOTE: MogPort and the 10-digit number are not in the game yet.

16-Tetra Master


---The Card Game From FFIX---

Tetra Master is a card game that originated from FFIX. It is a fun game to play
out of FFXI. Note that you play it on the Playonline server, not in the
world. It also costs $1 extra per month to play.

NOTE: MORE COMING SOON!!!

17-Bestiary

---Monsters From Around The World---

There are many different kinds of monsters in the world of FFXI. It takes real
adventures to find them and take them down. How many kinds of monsters or
beastmen lie out there to find? There are too many to count.

18-Areas


---Exporing Vana'diel could take years!---

Okay, a bit of an exagguration. But you get the point. Knowing the exact layout
of a city could take days on end. But, I will give a general summary on every
area. Although it is recommended that you look at square's website to get a
better look. http://www.playonline.com/ff11us/location/

NOTE: I need a lot of help from those that can give it! But only for high areas
because I just need more time for the basic areas.

----Place(slang)----Bind Point(BP)
*imporatnce*
Description
"fact"
/areas leading out/

----Bastok(Bas)----BP
*Starting City*
A large city with mechinary spreading through it. Many other countries dont
care for it much because they say it doesn't have a strong history. In some
ways, Bastok is an almost gothic city. It is dark grays and blues for the most
part. All of its government buildings are in the Metalworks which may seem
weird at first. The Humes and Galka are abundant in Bastok too. The Galkan,
however, are treated very bad. They pretty much just work in the mines and
there is a lot of hate between Galka and Humes. Galka all live in the Bastok
Mines section of city which is somewhat poor. But the work does pay off. Bastok
is the richest nation.
"People that were born in Bastok are Bastokan"
/Zeruhn Mines, North Gustaburg, South Gustaburg, Bastok/

----North Gustaburg(NGusta)----BP
*Area Outside Bastok*
North Gustaburg is less barren than south gustaburg. It is still a rocky
desert-like area. The large hill on it have some vegetation, but not much.
But there is a river and waterfall if you are into that sort of thing.
"There is a graveyard on top of one of the hills"
/Palborough Mines, South Gustaburg, Konschtat Highlands, Bastok/

----South Gustaburg(SGusta)----
*Area Outside Bastok*
South Gustaburg is the same as North Gustaburg. Well, not really. It has a
few puddles of water in the Fumaroles and it does have more hills. Can't forget
the lighthouse. But, it is still a desert. A desert you will come to hate.
"The lighthouse has a broken elevator"
/North Gustaburg, Dangruf Wadi, Bastok/

----Windurst(Windy)----BP
*Starting City*
Probably the opposite of Bastok. It is full of vegetation and blue waters. The
houses are practically build into the earth. Okay, there are some houses build
on pieces of wood. But it is lush and great to look at. Taru-taru and Mithra
can bee seen here in large numbers. The city is very peacefull overall.
"Three out of the four parts of the military both start with the same letter"
/West Sarutabaruta, East Sarutabaruta, Horutoto Ruins/

19-F.A.Q.


---Frequently Asked Questions=F.A.Q.---

Q. - Can this game be played offline like other Final Fantasies?
A. - No. There is no way to play this offline. It is completely online. It is
     an MMORPG meaning it is online-only. This is not Diablo II or PSO which
     are both ORPGs.

Q. - What Does MMORPG Mean?
A. - Incase you didnt look at the top, it means: Massivly Multiplayer Online
     Role Playing Game. This type of game is online-only with no exceptions.
     These types of games usually have monthly fees.

Q. - What does ORPG mean?
A. - ORPGs are Online Role Playing Games. These do not cost any money. However,
     these types of games are usually porly kept up. These games can be played
     offline. They are easily hacked games. ORPGs include:
     Diablo 1/2 and Phantasy Star Online
     Well, PSO does have a fee, but it doesnt need one. Or atleast it doesnt
     need one that high.

Q. - Will all ISPs work for this game?
A. - Yes, even AOL. But some are just really bad in general. You should
     probably change ISPs if this is the case.

Q. - Does FFXI have a monthly fee? If so, how much.
A. - Yes FFXI has a montly fee of $12.95 per month. You can get more things for
     more money. Each extra character you make is another $1.00 per month and
     Tetra Master (A cool card game) is also another $1.00 added on to the fee.

Q. - Is FFXI hacked a lot?
A. - No. If it does get hacked, the person who hacked it gets banned/sued.
     After the hacker is taken care of, they fix the problem fast.

Q. - Is the HDD required for the PS2 version?
A. - Yes, there is no way out of this. You have to buy it. Currently it is
     required to play FFXI and will add upgrades for SOCOM II and Grand
     Turismo 4. However, it will come pre-loaded with FFXI for $99.

Q. - Can you run out of Stamina while you are running?
A. - No, you cant. You could run as long as you want. There is no stamina bar.

Q. - When does this game get fun?
A. - This is actually a fairly common question. This game is unlike most other
     MMORPGs. This game has a weird "fun" system.
     (Mediocre Fun)=lv 1-9 (Little Fun)=lv 9-15 (Great Fun)=lv15+

Q. - Can you make a Male Mithra or a Female Galka?
A. - No. These races are of one sex ONLY. 

Q. - I got a weird answer when I did the benchmark test. What does it mean?
A. - Most likly it was the "Direct3D" one. This one shows the words "Direct3D"
     with a bunch of symbols after it. This means that your graphics card is
     not good enough to play the game. You should get a new graphics card if
     you want to play this game.

Q. - Should I get this game?
A. - This is the best MMORPG I have played. If you like MMORPGs, then all I
     have is "all-systems-go". If you want a better review, then look at some
     reviews.

Q. - What does the score I got for the benchmark mean?
A. - From the official site:

*******************************************************************************

Cannot run - 999: "Too Weak To Be Worthwhile" PC
Unfortunately, we assume that the specifications of your computer do not meet
requirements to run FINAL FANTASY XI for Windows. If you have this score even
though your computer meets the minimum system requirements, please adjust the
software resident on your PC. If your computer does not meet the minimum system
requirements, please consider upgrading your machine.

1000 to 1499: "Easy Prey" PC
We assume that your computer can run FINAL FANTASY XI for Windows. However,
your frame rate may drop when in a party with lots of effects or in crowded
cities. You should set the game settings (such as resolution and texture) as
low as possible. In addition, if these symptoms bother you, you may consider
upgrading your computer (such as increasing the amount of memory or upgrading
your graphics card, etc).

1500 to 1999: "Decent Challenge" PC
We assume that your computer can easily run FINAL FANTASY XI for Windows with
the default settings. If the frame rate bothers you when you run FINAL FANTASY

settings, etc) or adjust the display of weather effects.

20-Special Thanks


---Thank You...Thank You All---

I would like to say a good "Thank You" to:

- My Mom - 
It sounds really corny but since she has let me piss her off about FFXI and my
great obsession about it. Im surprised she has lasted this long.

- My Dad - 
This is his computor.

- Zack Huber (exile2k2) -
Gave me all of the commands in the "The Basics" section. Also gave stats for
the Dark Knight's scythe.

- Chris Grant (OwNjOO) -
Corrected some spelling/grammer mistakes.

- Bradley Lawrence (Cecil) -
Told me that Barstonra was for WHM, which made me realize that all the Bar-ra
spells are for WHM. So a good correction there.

- Taylor Risley (Grypht) -
To make a semi-longish story short, he let me know about the Bar spells for
RDM, so I added them.

- Elk of death -
Corrected the Elvann's AGI stat for DRK.

- GameFAQs - 
For letting me post it there, and giving me the inspiration I needed to waste
my time in front of the computor to help people I have never met.

- Me - 
I'm thanking myself because without myself, there would be no guide.

- Stat Calcualtor -
This is where I got max stat info.

- Shadow-Dragons -
For some info on job moves.

- ffxionline -
Gave me the basic info on where to find the advanced job quests.

- Tazirai -
Stats for summoner AF and Red mage AF.

- Kagetsu -
Stats for Beastmaster AF, Monk AF, Paladin AF, Thief AF, Dragoon AF.

- Zsedc -
Stats for the rest of Dark Knight AF, Samurai AF.

- Atma -
For making the artifact armour website .

- Maxim -
For some major corrections.

- Russta -
For samurais 'rice ball' correction.

- RPGdemon -
For organising everything all the AF stuff, putting the AF info together and
finding the AF stats for: White Mage, Black Mage, Bard, Warrior and Ranger.

- Toby Stauss (Savage) -
RSE info and starting ring info.

- My own free time - 
Since I have so much free time I can spend all day doing pointless stuff. I
decided to put that time to good use by making a guide. 80+ hours of free time
a week is how I produced this guide in a couple of days.

21-Closing


This FAQ was probably the longest thing I have ever made (excluding my three
"videogame designs on paper"). This is still somewhat of a work in progress but
hopefully it has helped you out in some sort of way. There Is many aspects of
this game I have yet to put on this guide because it is such a immense game.
With the expansions making this guide all the more longer, I may have trouble
keeping up (despite my age). If you have something about the guide you want to
say then E-Mail me. Unlike most people I will take criticism and remarks that
hopefully will make my guide all the more better. What you say may not get in
the guide, but if it does you will know. Your name will be in the "Special
Thanks" section. Oh, and try to make it something readable. I will give you a
reply if I cannot understand anything you say. I will always reply to an
E-Mail. That my friends (in FFXI and anyone reading this FAQ) concludes this
FAQ for now.
