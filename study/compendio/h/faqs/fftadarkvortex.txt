|_|=========================================================================|_|

Final Fantasy Tactics Advance is a game produced  by Square-Enix to celebrate
the re-partnership between Square and Nintendo for the Nintendo GBA. Although
bearing the same name as the original PlayStation version, Final Fantasy 
Tactics Advance is a completely different game. Not only does it hold a 
different story, but the game itself has changed. 

Like all RPGs, Final Fantasy Tactics is full of complications in which new
players might get tangled within...

And that proves the point of this guide. In no way is Final Fantasy Tactics
Advance (as well as the other Final Fantasies) easy to learn at first. This 
guide is designed to be both a reference for veteran players, and a strategy
guide for those newer players. 

Hopefully, both new and old players alike will find this particularly guide
helpful. After all, with such an amazing and awe-inspiring game as Final 
Fantasy Tactics Advance, we need an equally awe-inspiring guide. </ego boost>

| |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 2. FAQ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[2000]~| |
|_|=========================================================================|_|

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   
      [Q] How long is this game?

      [A] This game is really pretty long. The game itself is 300 missions 
          long. 

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

      [Q] I failed a mission which had an item I needed to do another mission!
          What do I do?!

      [A] Don't get all panicky just yet! Most of the time, the game will allow
          you to redo dispatch missions so you can get that item even though
          you failed the first time. However, at times, the mission once 
          failed won't appear ever again. Try not to fail too many to avoid 
          this. 

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

      [Q] Why is there no "Controls" section in this FAQ?

      [A] I felt it wasn't needed. In it's place, I put my "Basics to Battling"
          section. 

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

      [Q] What does it mean when it says, "[Insert name] has mastered [Insert
          Ability]?"

      [A] Your member has mastered that particular ability. If you needed an 
          item to use that ability, you can now use that ability whenever you
          want without the item. I would suggest immediately learning a new
          ability after mastering one so you don't waste experience. 

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

      [Q] How many missions are there in all? I need help finding them and
          completing them!

      [A] There are 300 missions in all which you can undergo and accomplish.
          Keep in mind that there are also three or four "Reserve" missions 
          which don't count to your mission count. Don't worry, I'll list them
          as well as provide strategy to completing them. 

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

      [Q] Does it really matter which missions you do first?

      [A] You can do the missions in any order you would like. Although 
          sometimes, doing one mission ahead of the other might help you out
          quite a bit. However, there will always be this one objective that
          you must complete to advance through the game. Read the walkthrough
          for more information. 

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     [Q] What does the [Insert number here]+[h] icon in the upper right corner
         mean?

     [A] It's the land unit height. For example, say that a piece of land is
         1 unit high. Then it would be 3h. Certain characters can only jump
         a few units high while others can jump higher. Experiment around with
         them. 

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     [Q] How do I complete Mission [Insert mission here]?

     [A] The walkthrough holds the required missions to advance through the
         game. Apart from that, you can just read the Missions list for the
         remaining ones. 

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     [Q] What do the Move, Jump, and Evade stats mean?
 
     [A] Move is the amount of steps your character can take in one turn. Jump
         is the amount of tiles a character can jump (Read above). And Evade
         is how evasive the clanner is in avoiding attacks and status ailments
         against. 

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     [Q] What exactly are: Atk., Def., Pow., Res., and Speed stats?

     [A] Atk. stands for Weapon Attack; how much damage your character can do
         with the equipped weapon. Def. stands for Weapon Defense. This stat
         is how much punishment from another weapon your clanner can take. Pow.
         stands for Magic Power, which is how powerful your character's magic
         is, and finally, Res. stands for Magic Resistance, which is the same
         as Weapon Defense except it shows your characters resistance to magic.
         Speed is obviously, how fast your character is. Faster characters move
         first. 

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     [Q] What is a Totema?

     [A] Totemas are the protector of the five crystals. Each one represents
         each race. During the game, you will be fighting all five to destroy
         all five crystals. Upon defeating a Totema, you will be able to use
         its power in battle with 10 JP.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 
     [Q] There is a way to predict how much damage your attack will inflict and
         the accuracy of it, somewhere. Right?

     [A] This question is kind of stupid as those figures are in plain sight. 
         Right before you initiate a move, the estimated damage and accuracy 
         is shown right above your character's HP count. You can see this for 
         any move, even your enemys'. 

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     [Q] Can any unit learn an Ultima attack?

     [A] The answer to that is no. Only a select few jobs can learn the Ultima
         attacks. However, while powerful, they are incredibly pricy. AP is
         999 and MP cost is a whopping 60!

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     [Q] Okay, how do you learn moves like White Wind or Mighty Guard if the
         enemy monster won't use it on you?

     [A] This is one of the many hardships for getting a Blue Mage. If you ever
         want to see your Blue Mage learn an ability like that, you are going
         to need a Beastmaster. Tell your Beastmaster to control the monster 
         that holds the ability, and then force the monster to use it on you.
         For example, to get White Wind, you need your Beastmaster to know the
         ability, Fairy. Therefore, the Beastmaster can control the Sprite. 
         Force White Wind onto the Blue Mage and there you go. The same goes
         for all other non-offensive attacks.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     [Q] I don't understand why the Bomb/Grenade doesn't hold the Blowup 
         ability for my Blue Mage. What is up?

     [A] For that ability to be available, the controlled Bomb/Grenade must
         be in critical health. Then, control it, and you will note that the
         ability magically appeared. However, be aware that there is a 20% 
         chance that this will not occur. Continually control it with your
         Beastmaster, and you should see it eventually. I have noticed that 
         the chances go up considerably when the Bomb/Grenade is surrounded
         on three-four sides. If it can't move while in critical health, it
         will most likely hold the Blowup ability. 

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     [Q] Can a Blue Mage learn from another Blue Mage?

     [A] Although Learning is expected to be used from monsters, you can teach
         your Blue Mage moves from another Blue Mage. 

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     [Q] I'm a Blue Mage idiot. How do you learn a move like Roulette if it 
         KOs you instantly?

     [A] There is a simple answer to that. Cast Auto-Life on it or simply hold
         an item like Angel Ring to automatically get an Auto-Life.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     [Q] Can the Thief's ability, Steal: Ability steal any ability?
 
     [A] No, it can only steal an ability that's learned by a job in it's 
         race. For example, say Crout, the (human) Thief decides to steal a 
         Templar's ability. That's impossible as the abilities that a Templar
         learns cannot be learned by any human job. However, if he uses Steal:
         Ability on any human, he'll get an ability. There are some exceptions
         however. Crout can still use Steal: Ability on a White Monk, and get
         one of two ability, Air Render or Far Fist. Why? Because Air Render
         and Far Fist are abilities that the human Fighter can learn. 
         Therefore, Crout will master the Fighter A-Ability. 

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     [Q] Which is better? Turbo MP or Geomancy?

     [A] Turbo MP doubles the MP usage, but creates bigger damage and best of
         all, improves your hit rate. However, Geomancy on the other hand 
         doesn't affect the MP cost, but it does improve Magic Power. I prefer
         Turbo MP on my units with lots of MP (Illusionist), and Geomancy
         with more offensive spells (Black Mage). 

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     [Q] Do the eight skill levels do anything else other than being requisites
         for certain missions?

     [A] Yes, they do one more thing. Upon reaching a certain level for each
         skill, you will get items. Most of them cannot be bought in the Shop
         so you will want to get those skill levels up to collect all of them. 
         You will find a full list in the "Your Clan" section.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     [Q] How many Mission Items are there in all?

     [A] I would believe there are 122 (more or less). Check the "Your Clans" 
         section for a full list. 

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     [Q] What's the maximum amount of Mission Items you can carry?
 
     [A] I would believe that figure is 64. Any more, and you will be forced to
         throw one of them out.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     [Q] When do I get to use Law Cards?

     [A] Law Cards become available after completing Mission #6 Antilaws, and
         rescusing Ezel. From that point, you can visit Ezel's shop in Cadoan
         and bargain for different Cards. 

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     [Q] How do I use Law Cards?

     [A] When it's one of your unit's turn, press the B Button and the game
         menu will appear. Select Law Cards and choose the Law Card you want
         to use. 

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     [Q] What's the difference between a White Card and a Dark Card.
  
     [A] The White Cards are Law Cards that add a law. They are useful when
         your enemy is using a move which you really hate. For example, if your
         opponent constantly Charms you, you might want to add a Charm Law
         Card so that your opponent can't use Charm anymore without 
         receiving Yellow Cards. Dark Cards are the Antilaws. These work the
         exact opposite by deleting or "nullifying" The day's Laws. Use these
         to take out any pesky Laws that you don't like.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     [Q] How many Law Cards and Antilaws can you carry in all?

     [A] That number is 24. If you attempt to hold one more, you will be forced
         to throw one out. Don't let that happen, as you can simply trade away
         the cards you don't like for useful cards.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     [Q] If an ability requires 999 AP, does that mean it can't be mastered?

     [A] I know it might already be an instinct after playing a lot of other
         games to think that 999 AP means infinite AP, but yes, you can still
         master them. Even though it does indeed take a while to get that 999
         AP, it is possible. You will find that some higher end abilities 
         require that amount. 

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     [Q] Can a Beastmaster control a Morpher when he is in Morph mode?

     [A] Although that would be pretty cool, the answer is no. Even when the
         Morpher is "morphed," it cannot be controlled by the Beastmaster. 
         They can only control genuine monsters, not imitation. 

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     [Q] Is it true that prices differ from Shop to Shop?
 
     [A] Yes, that is true. Generally, Shops sell items in which the inhabitant
         of that town uses, at a cheaper price. For example, Muscadet is a 
         Viera town. Therefore, all weapons and items that Viera's use are at
         a cheaper price. Rapiers are a perfect example. At the Baguba Port 
         Shop (Moogle town), items like Guns and Knuckles will be down in 
         price, etc.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     [Q] I threw out [Insert Mission Item here]. Can I get another one?
 
     [A] That depends. If it's an item like Black Thread or something like 
         that, you will have to start over or trade with a friend. Certain
         mission items can be received again and again but certain items 
         require you to keep them. 

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     [Q] How do you save in mid-battle?

     [A] When it's one of your unit's turn, press the B Button and the game
         menu will appear. Choose the save option that should be at the bottom
         and save your game. Keep in mind that once you load up a game file
         saved in battle, the file will automatically disappear afterwards. 

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     [Q] What are the possible status ailments or things that appear in bubble
         above a character?

     [A] There are quite a few. Some of then are good while the others are bad.

              - Addle (Addles foe to prevent enemy from using abilities.)

              - Confuse (Confuses foe so that enemy will attack the nearest

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     [Q] WHAT THE **** HAPPENED TO BAHUMAT?!

     [A] Well, it was removed from Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. Yes, I know
         it was in the regular Tactics for the PS, but this time, Bahumat 
         won't be making its appearance. 

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     [Q] Are there any secret characters?

     [A] Yes, there are quite a few. Check the section with the same name for 
         more information.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     [Q] Is Babus really a Nu Mou? He doesn't look like it. 

     [A] I have heard this many of a time, and I have one answer, yes. Babus
         is discussed often because of his non-resemblance to normal Nu Mou.
         While I just think that this is caused by his obvious well-groomed
         lifestyle (Just look how shiny he looks!), others think that he was
         modeled after Mewt's teddy bear. It's a useless bit of trivia, but
         interesting nonetheless.

| |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 3. Basics to Battling ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[3000]~| |
|_|=========================================================================|_|

The game will provide you a small tutorial at the beginning of the game (even
though it's a snowball fight instead of a real battle). This should usually be
enough for most people but if you still are confused, here's the basics to 
battling in my own words.

When you start off, you usually have to place the clan members you want in
the fight immediately on the deck. You can only place them on the blue squares
flashing and most missions and encounters don't let you exceed six on the 
field at once. Once you have placed your character, you can change the 
direction you want them to be facing. Try to be smart when picking your 
characters. If the law states no swords, then putting eight soldiers on the
field won't help you. Also, try to face your clan members towards the enemy.

As you progress through the game, you will learn more and more about where
to place your players and in what positions. Most of the time, I would put 
all Archers and people with ranged attacks in the front along with the main
Soldiers and melee members. White Mages usually aren't made to attack enemies
so keep them in the rear. It's all about strategy.

The player with the fastest speed (you or the enemy) will move first. To move,
you first have to select "Move" from the menu. The pieces of land in blue are
currently accessible. You might want to move to attack an enemy or avoid an
enemy's attack. If you currently are a melee member, try to get in back of 
your target or to the sides. It's much easier to hit an enemy if you get them
from the back. Same thing with Archers and ranged attacks. 

To attack an enemy or just use an ability, use the "Action" icon when you are
in range for an attack or an ability. After selecting what you want, there
will be a "Do It" or "Cancel" option. If you have second thoughts about 
using the move you currently are, you can cancel it and go back. Successive
hits will gain you experience as well as help you win against your opponent. 

You can tell one of your members to "Wait." This means that they won't do 
anything. You can still select which direction they will face though. If you
tell a member to "Wait," they will have their turn earlier next round. 

This turn of turns will continue until everyone gets a chance to move or use
"Action." Then it will cycle back around. The order will for the most part, 
never stay the same. People will constantly Wait and they will get earlier 
positions. 

That's really the hang of it really. Be sure to check the laws (do that by 
pressing B when it's one of your members turn and pressing Law on the main 
menu). Breaking them will give you either a Yellow Card or a Red Card. Two
Yellow Cards equal a Red Card and then you will be sent to prison. Bailing a 
member will cost you gil however so try not to get caught too much.

         |        secrets  remained:  an ancient book known       |
         |        as  the Gran Grimoire, hidden in darkness       |
         |        by the powers that once were.                   |
         |                                                        |
         |        It is not certain how many copies of  the       |

         |        to adjust  to country life with  the help       |

Of course, the walkthrough is meant to be a mission-by-mission walkthrough 
throughout the length of the entire game. There will be a load of major 
spoilers throughout the walkthrough obviously so read at your own risk. 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]

The game starts off immediately in the local school yard. You are Marche (you
can change your name later on) and you are a new kid in the town of St. 
Ivalice. Immediately into the game, a group of kids begin making fun of a 
boy named Mewt. Marche decides to stand up a bit for him, but instead, the
bullies begin teasing over Marche. Luckily, a local named Ritz decides to 
stand up for the both of them. Type in your name (or leave it at Marche if
you'd like). The annoying bully will switch teams as Ritz offers him and the
first battle of the game will go underway. 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]
 | Team Activity : Snowball Fight \
 |=================================\

          Difficulty: Very Easy
          Enemies:    
                    Nurse 
                    D.J. (Guiness)
                    PE Head (Colin)
                    PE Head (Lyle)

This is really just a tutorial rather than a real full-scale battle. First off,
Mr. Leslaie, your teacher will offer to teach you a little bit about snowball
fights. Ritz will offer to help as well. You should try to pay attention to
it the best you can. When the small tutorial is finished, press "No" to 
continue. 

Now the controls are finally given over to you. Experiment a bit moving, and
throw snowballs at your leisure (By the way, pay no attention to their job 
names, they don't make any sense). Don't sweat over this battle. You can't win
or lose let alone KOing anyone at all. After the second turn begins(Or until 
Mewt loses all HP), Mewt will begin to run... The boys see this as a perfect
opportunity to get some more comments in.
                      
[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]

The bullies will continue to throw snowballs at Mewt and Mewt only. Luckily,
Ritz finally moves in to help out the poor kid. The last snowball from Colin
will knock a gash in Mewt's forehead and cause it to bleed which Marche will
notice immediately. Ritz will get a bit angry and blame the boys for being
totally unjustified and for being big, fat meanies. That was really the last
straw for those boys and they now begin making fun of Ritz, calling her 
"whitey-locks" for her white hair (It might just be me but I think girls with
white hair are hot). With that last move, Ritz loses it and if not for Mr.
Leslaie who had just walked in the nick of time, she would have probably 
beaten the living crap out of Colin. That sure would have been interesting!

After Mr. Leslaie brings away the three boys (BUSTED!), the scene will shift
to an empty playground with Ritz, Mewt, and Marche. Mewt will thank both Marche
and Ritz for helping him on the playground and then asks Marche what he's 
doing after school. Marche will explain that he has to pick up his brother from
the hospital and Mewt offers to bring over a special "book" for his two
new friends. Marche accepts along with Ritz who also decides to tag along.

The scene will shift once again and some soft, friendly music will play. You
will be on the city streets where a pretty hardcore-looking man appears to 
be apologizing to two officials. Apparently, he must have done something...
Ritz will say some pretty mean things about Mewt's dad, obviously unknowing 
that the man is Mewt's father. There will be some typical "father & son" small
talk and then Marche will leave the screen along the Mewt's father. Ritz will
explain to Mewt that Marche's family is also a bit disfunctional. Marche 
doesn't have a dad.

Scene shift to a boy sitting in a wheelchair. Marche will walk in and greet
his brother, Doned. Marche will explain that they had a snowball fight today.
Doned asks if they picked on him again and Marche will tell him that he's 
just not used to sports. Doned makes a wise-crack, saying Marche was never 
good at sports, and laughs. Soon, Mewt and Ritz will arrive and Mewt brings 
out his book. Mewt says that he doesn't even know what the title is and they
open up the book.

A colorful cinematic will occur. Note the strange creatures that are drawn 
throughout the book. You will be meeting some of them very soon. Marche will
say that he can't read those letters at all. Ritz thinks that the book is in
Latin and Mewt will read some incomprehensible letters. Doned will then say 
that he wishes he could use magic. And then again, Doned tells Marche that 
maybe if he could use magic, he'd be better at sports. Everyone laughs (Except
for Marche of course). Mewt then says that it would be cool if this book were
real. Ritz then says that books are usually boring and games are a lot more
likeable. Following is a discussion on what game they would love to live. Mewt
says he would love Final Fantasy, his favorite. Then, Marche's two friends 
leave and another cinematic appears.

Suddenly, the local schoolyard turns into a desert and the town street 
transforms into a busy marketplace with strange creatures. Cut to Marche's
room where the two are sleeping. Doned disappears somewhere and Marche floats
up and changes clothes. He is then sent to a desert town somewhere...

Marche wakes and wonders where the heck he could possibly be. He looks at the 
creatures and gets a bit confused. He then walks up a bit and runs into a 
lizard-like creature (A Bangaa). Unknowing of their proper name, Marche calls
them lizards which obviously got them pretty angry. Luckily, a talking stuffed
animal comes and saves the day. The thing (A Moogle) will explain to the 
Bangaa that Marche just came from the countryside. Marche apologizes and all
is well... until the Bangaa challenges Marche to an engagement...

A strange person in armor appears and the Moogle explains that the Bangaa is
engaging you. 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]
 | Engage With : Bangaas \
 |========================\

          Difficulty: Very Easy
          Enemies:    
                    White Monk 
                    Warrior

Marche then understands that Engage means fight. The Moogle then delivers a 
fairly comedic affirmative. The Moogle then explains that the person in armor
is a judge and the laws for today are fixed. The Moogle then tells a confused
Marche that the law for today bans Items and advises Marche to always check
the law. Soon, it'll be your turn...

Remember the Snowball Fight? Well, an engagement is basically the same thing.
You are a Soldier right now and you are armed with a Shortsword. Move up to
the Bangaa (Go to the side or back for a better chance of hitting) and Fight 
him. The Moogle (Who's name, you'll find out is Montblanc) is a Black Mage and
he'll use his elemental attacks. This is a very easy battle. Just defeat the
two Bangaas to win.

Along the battle, you will learn about Judge Points as well. Montblanc will
explain that they allow you to do combos with other clan members. (But later,
they'll be used for the Totemas...)

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]

After the battle, the Bangaa you just KOed will rise again and use a Potion to
heal his HP. However, do you remember the law on Items? The judge will 
immediately notice and runs over to send the Bangaa to prison. Montblanc will
then explain to Marche the jail system where the people who break laws go to.

The Moogle will explain that his name is Montblanc if you hadn't already 
known. Montblanc will ask Marche a few questions and in the end, Marche learns
that he really has gotten himself into something weird. Montblanc will bring
you to his clan. He then gives you the honor of naming the clan. If you can't
come up with any ideas, just use the default, Nutsy. But let me tell you 
something, if I ever link with you and you have Nutsy as your clan title, I 
will impale you with a leaking pen (For real). You can easily tell how much
I despise it. 

And finally, you will appear at the world map where you are to place the 
Sprohm symbol. Notice all the empty circles. By the end of the game, you 
would have filled up all of them give or take one. Also, you should now notice
that you have a chance to save. I would suggest you do that right now.

Head over to Cyril (If you aren't already there) and go to the Shop. I would
suggest upgrading some of your character's armor (not weapons yet. I'm sure
you'd rather learn their abilities first) and perhaps give them a few 
accessories. When that's done, head over to the Pub and read some of the 
Rumors. They are very helpful so I'd suggest going through them all. When 
you're done with that, go back and select Missions. 

There's only one on the board so select Herb Picking. Read through the mission
description if you like and the Pubmaster will explain to you Mission Items, 
then hit OK and confirm that you want this mission. He'll take 300 Gil as the 
information cost and that's your first mission. Montblanc will ask you about
your mission and Marche will respond. When you are ready, head over to Giza
Plains. Be sure to check the law for today before engaging. 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]
 | Mission : Herb Picking \
 |=========================\

          Difficulty: Very Easy
          Enemies:    
                    Goblin 
                    Goblin 
                    Goblin 
                    Red Cap 
                    Sprite 

Enter the Giza Plains area and Marche and Montblanc will walk in. Immediately,
Marche will notice some monsters and note that they will have to clear them 
out. You are allowed four more clan members (or everyone in your clan 
obviously) to join the battle. This isn't difficult at all so you can take 
your time. The Goblins aren't very powerful but the Red Cap can cause some 
problems. I'd suggest bombarding it with Black Magic from Montblanc. The 
Sprite should probably be left for last as it doesn't use any abilities and 
its Fight move does miniscule damage. Once you defeat all enemies, you will 
have completed your first mission! 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]

After the mission, Montblanc will ask you what you were supposed to be 
collecting again. Marche will respond with Muscmaloi and Montblanc will 
explain that they grow all over the place. Oh well, it was an easy mission and
hopefully, it familiarized the battle system a bit. 

Get to either Sprohm or Cyril and check the Pub again. There will be quite a 
few missions for you to play through. Notice the missions at the top. Most of
the time, those missions are the ones required to get through the game. The
remaining are just optional quests. However, I would strongly suggest you 
complete the other three missions before disembarking for the mission, Thesis
Hunt and gain a few levels. 

You might also notice a Mission that doesn't have a sword symbol next to it, 
but instead, a scroll. This is a dispatch mission and there's no engagement
involved. Choosing one of your clanners to dispatch, they will be gone for 
the days listed and return at the end of that period. You can fail or win it,
but all that depends on the clanner you choose to send out. As you progress
through the game, you'll learn more about it. 

When you think you are ready, buy the mission, Thesis Hunt, and venture over 
to Lutia Pass. Be sure you brought some Potions (Can be bought at the Shop) 
along with you.

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]
 | Mission : Thesis Hunt \
 |========================\ 

          Difficulty: Medium
          Enemies:    
                    Archer 
                    Soldier x2
                    Thief x2
                    White Mage 

This battle is really a major step up from the previous "Monster Mash" that we 
just had. Instead of the weakling Goblins, now we are up against a group of 
pickpockets who have a few tricks up their sleeves.

The two units at the top of the arena are a White Mage and a lvl. 4 Thief. 
Those two (obviously) cannot be attacked towards the first few rounds because 
of their position but you should attempt to prioritize them the best you can. 
The stronger, lvl. 4 Thief know the Reaction ability, Counter which should be 
something new to you. To avoid that ability, use ranged attacks like 
Montblanc's Black Magic or your Archer. The Soldiers use Mug often, but other 
than that, they just attack with sword slashes. While their swords can do 
quite some damage, don't waste time on them until the end of the battle. 
Defeat the Archer quickly before it can use any of his annoying, Aim: Arm
or Aim: Legs crap. When everyone is taken down, the mission is yours and 
Dalilei's thesis is back into safe keeping. 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]

Afterwards, Montblanc will explain to you the clan wars. The "Clan" option 
will also be placed in your main menu. Check it out if you want. From this 
point on, you now have the ability to challenge other clans. They are 
represented by the other red people on the overworld map. Challenge them by
walking into them. This is a great way to gain EXP so take advantage of it 
and challenge as many as possible. Don't forget about the laws though!

Now head over to Cyril to trigger a small cutscene. The Pubmaster will greet
you as always and he'll tell you that there's a lot of clans who want to 
fight, and basically, tells you to keep your distance. After that you can 
head over to the Pub where a bunch of missions are available. Read the Rumors
first though. Do as many missions as you'd like and engage with a few clans to 
get the feel of them. When you feel your clan members are at a solid level 
(Levels 5-6 are good), choose The Cheetahs from the mission menu. Head over
to Nubswood.  

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]
 | Mission : The Cheetahs \
 |=========================\ 

          Difficulty: Easy
          Enemies:    
                    Thief
                    White Monk 
                    Fighter
                    Archer 
                    Black Mage 

Marche will step into the Nubswood area and who else does he find other than 
his old friend, Ritz!... Along with a Viera who calls herself Shara. Also on 
the playing field is the clan which calls themselves the "Cheetahs." And 
after a bit of a reunion, the battle begins with you being allied with Ritz 
and Shara. With them, this engagement is that much easier. 

I wouldn't suggest a White Mage for this battle, while you can still bring one 
in if you are unsure of your clan, there's a very little chance that any of 
your units will actually get KOed as long as you know what you're doing. You 
can only bring in three other clanners so the free space can be useful. You 
should take out the White Mage first obviously. Then, go for the Archer which 
can immobilize and disable your units. I know you might want to prioritize 
the Thief and Fighter, but during this battle, they aren't really any threat.
Your second priority should be the White Monk, and the rest is your choice. 
It's a very easy battle so take your time. 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]

Shortly after the battle, the three will have a conversation. Ritz tells Marche
that she loves this world and never wants to go back. Marche concurs however
and then leaves the scene. Place Eluut Sands on the map and venture to the
Cyril Pub to trigger a cutscene.

Marche will tell Montblanc that he was sure that Ritz would want to go back so
that the both of them could find their way home. Apparently, he was totally
wrong. 

The next mission is Desert Peril, but before you do that, engage a few clans
and do some of the missions. Also, check the shops for some interesting stuff
you might want to buy. Now, about your levels. Try to head off to Eluut Sands
with the mission Desert Peril, with all your members at lvl. 6-7. You'll need
it, believe me. 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]
 | Mission : Desert Peril \
 |=========================\ 

          Difficulty: Slightly Hard
          Enemies:  
                    Cream 
                    Red Panther x2
                    Antlion 
                    Coeurl 

Marche and Montblanc will walk into the area when the two are greeted by a 
group of monsters. Well, nothing else to do but engage them. 

This is a tough battle considering how early in the game it is. You probably 
don't have any better jobs other than the regular Archer, Soldier, etc. The 
toughest monsters here are the Panther class. Those are the two Red Panthers 
and the Coeurl which is a stronger, blue version of the Red Panther. All three 
have incredible attack power and their defense is really high. If your Archer 
has learned Aim: Arm, target the Coeurl to disable it for a while. The Cream 
is a strange creature which is barely affected by physical attack. However, 
use Fire (As it is weak against fire elemental) from one of your Black Mages
to kill it in one shot or critically damage it. With the three Panthers out of 
the way, this battle will go much quicker. Chip away at the monsters and
victory is yours!

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]
 
After the battle, Marche will question Montblanc as to why the monsters here
are, or simply could go so crazy. Montblanc will respond with the best of his
ability. There are many theories and one of them is the theory of crystals. 
Montblanc will explain to Marche that some think that there are crystals hiding
somewhere. Upon ending the conversation, place the Ulei River on the map.

After that, you can head to the Pub for a bunch of new missions. Try the 
Dispatches, and level up your clan to 8-9. When all is done, the mission, 
Twisted Flow, from the mission menu should be your next objective. Head over
to Ulei River and begin your engagement. 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]
 | Mission : Twisted Flow \
 |=========================\ 

          Difficulty: Hard
          Enemies:  
                    Totema (Famfrit)
                    Floateye x2
                    Ahriman x2

Marche will slowly walk into the Ulei River area. After looking around a tiny 
bit, he concludes that nothing seems to be wrong. However, a strange black 
warp will appear in the center of the screen. Immediately, Marche is on his 
guard, but his cautiousness isn't enough to avoid the warp itself which sends 
Marche to a strange temple-like area...
 
At first, Marche will be confused. However, he looks ahead and notices 
something... A crystal! But before he can do anything, a strange voice booms 
through the air demanding Marche's name. Uttering a nervous whisper, Marche 
returns the question. A strange creature warps out of the crystal and explains 
to you that his name is Famfrit, the Totema of the first crystal. Though he 
looks friendly, he isn't about to let some insecure human get to the crystal 
which he was charged with defending. Calling upon two Floateyes and two 
Ahrimans, he wishes to engage.

The objective here is to defeat the boss. In this case, it's the Moogle Totema,
Famfrit. If your units are leveled up well enough, this battle will go much 
quicker. The best thing you can do would be to put Famfrit to sleep and deal 
with the other monsters first even though your objective is to take out 
Famfrit. While Famfrit is asleep, you will want Marche or your main attacker
to get up to him and give him a nice slash or smack to wake him and get a free 
hit. Note that one of the Ahriman's knows the ability, Roulette. It gets in a 
corner and randomly KOs a random unit, on your team or even on his own team. 
Diligently cut away at Famfrit's health and you should defeat this Totema. 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]

The first Totema battle is now over with the defeat of Famfrit. Marche 
immediately wants to know what the crystal is and what role it plays. The 
crystal is the thread that binds the world. The world that Famfrit, the Moogle
Totema, was born to protect. With that, Famfrit gives clues to which race he
was born. The white ones, the skilled machinists. With that, Famfrit offers to
lend you his power...

Famfrit disappears and the first crystal will crack. Mewt will appear for a 
moment and another booming voice will tell you that when the threads are
destroyed, this world will be dissolved and another will be born. The screen
fades to white...

Scene shift to Bervenia Palace. Judgemaster Cid walks in to a troubled Mewt.
Cid will ask Mewt what has happened. Mewt resolves on something horrible that
has happened a while ago. The kids at the schoolyard were throwing snowballs.
A terrible memory but Mewt passes it on quickly. Being the Prince Mewt 
himself, he asks to strengthen the Laws to justify what has happened. With 
that, Queen Remedi, Mewt's mother will walk in along with Babus, Mewt's 
servant. Mewt's request was granted, the Laws are now stronger.

Scene shift to a later point on the Ulei River. The dark warp brings Marche
back, confused and dazed. Marche recaps and realizes that he must destroy every
crystal if he ever wants to go back home! Justifying his statement, Marche now
disembarks to destroy the next crystals. Now, you have the Moogle Totema, 
Famfrit, which can be used by any Moogle with 10 JP. Along with that, place
Cadoan on the map. 

Begin by heading off to Cadoan to trigger a cutscene. Some townsfolk will be
complaining about the Laws and throwing some knocks at the Queen. A strange Nu
Mou will walk in on you and give you a few words about the Laws. The townsfolk
will then discuss the new gossip. A person by the name of Ezel Berbier has 
seemingly found some way around the Laws of Ivalice with "Antilaws." With that,
the Nu Mou gives you a few words on Ezel Berbier and takes his leave...

Walk to Cyril or Sprohm and buy some items like Potions and such. Re-equip if
you'd like and do any missions. When you are finished, head to Cadoan again to
trigger an engagement! 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]
 | Mission : Antilaws \
 |=====================\ 

          Difficulty: Medium
          Enemies:  
                    Gladiator  
                    Illusionist 
                    Hunter
                    Ninja 
                    Fighter
                    Defender

It seems that shady Nu Mou fellow we met before in Cadoan is now in trouble. 
Marche isn't too smart here. Oh yes, let's help some random Nu Mou stranger 
that we only met through chance. Anyhow, Marche, being the ethical fellow he 
is, decides to help the troubled Nu Mou, whether he's a murderer or simply a 
innocent bystander. Let's find out.
  
The battle consists of your clan versus six other enemies. Ezel the Hermetic 
(Yes, you learn that the Nu Mou fellow is the great Ezel Berbier) will help 
you out but he won't actually attack. His ability, Azoth, can put all the 
enemies to sleep. However, since you can't control him, it's hard to tell if 
Ezel will use it or not. Anyhow, the Illusionist is probably a new unit you 
haven't yet seen before. Illusionists use Phantasm to throw a spell and damage
the entire field without having to manually hit something.

This battle is tough, yes, but if you know who to prioritize, you should be 
fine. If your clan has low Magic Resistance, the Illusionist should be your 
main target. If your clan has low Defense, the Fighter and Defender should be 
taken out immediately. The Hunter and Ninja on the upper rear end of the 
playing field should be attacked last. Constantly attack and you should be 
fine. Be sure that Ezel stays alive however!

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]

Once the enemy forces are defeated, the situation seems to be over with after
a quick thanks from Ezel... if only Judgemaster Cid hadn't been summoned 
because of the ruckus we created over here. A short conversation between Ezel
and Cid will occur. Cid asks that Ezel come into his custody, but Ezel declines
"respectfully." Cid will attempt an Advanced Law to Petrify Ezel, but that
Berbier fellow has a few tricks up his sleeves. Pulling out an Antilaw, he 
teleports out... with you following. Cid, being defeated, walks away like 
nothing happened.

In the Cadoan Pub, Marche queries Ezel on what the heck just happened. As 
obvious, Ezel's Antilaw stopped Cid's Advanced Law. Marche considers that to
be an amazing feat. Berbier states that the Judges and their Laws have crossed
the lines... as well as being fun to annoy! As the conversation draws to a 
close, Ezel tells Marche of his secret Law Card shop. With that, the convo
ends.

Now with Mission #6 finished, you have access to the Law Cards and Antilaws.
Since you are already at Cadoan, check out Ezel's shop. By now, you should only
have the R2 Antilaw which you received as an award for that mission, but as 
you advance through the game, you will gain more and more. Use them to nullify
Laws, or add new ones. If you are ever missing a card you really want, check
out Ezel's shop for some trading. 

There are a bunch of new Missions hanging out at the Sprohm, Cyril, and Cadoan
Pubs. Check them out as you always do, and read any new rumors that appear.
Once you feel you are ready for the next story Mission, choose Diamond Rain,
ahead head over to Aisenfield for another engagement!

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]
 | Mission : Diamond Rain \
 |=========================\

          Difficulty: Slightly Hard
          Enemies:    
                    Bomb
                    Lamia
                    Ice Flan
                    Icedrake
 
Take a look at the enemies list for this mission. Yep, all of them are 
monsters, and all of them have incredibly valuable abilities for a Blue Mage, 
or your Morpher. Therefore, you might want to bring in a Beastmaster (Along 
with a Blue Mage) or a Hunter. However, be aware that this monster battle is 
no pushover, so make sure you also bring in your best units too.

The enemies are all generic, except for the Ice Flan. As you might already 
know, the Flan group of monsters only are affected by magical spells. The most 
effective one would be the Fire elemental, which one of your Black Mage's 
should already have. The two Icedrakes differ in abilities. One has the 
Dragoon tech, Ice Breath, and the other holds Mighty Guard. Both Icedrakes 
have high attack power, so beware. 

To start off, you should attack the Lamia, and the Ice Flan with a nice ranged
Fire elemental attack. Following up, take out the first Icedrake. The Bomb can 
be left for last, as it doesn't hold any redeeming qualities. Once you get the
Ice Flan and the Icedrakes out of the way, the battle will become another 
generic monster fight. Easy enough.

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]

With the monsters defeated, Marche begins to walk around and check out the 
strange diamond rain. Shortly after the battle, Marche notes that a diamond 
has fell from the sky, but as soon as he reaches it, it disappears. Strangely
enough, maybe the rain does have something to deal with the crystals. But hey,
who knows what's going to happen next?

Roda Volcano is the next area you are to place on the map. The local Pubs 
don't have any new rumors, but a new load of missions appear. Most of them are
just dispatches, but be sure you capture a few of the areas. You should already
know that the more areas you own, the more benefits you get in the Shops and
such. Level your clan up to 10-11, and choose the Hot Awakening mission. With
that, head over the Roda Volcano and begin your next mission. 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]
 | Mission : Hot Awakening \
 |==========================\

          Difficulty: Medium
          Enemies: 
                   Ultima Crystal x8

Marche steps into the Roda Volcano area and starts nagging about the heat. 
Suddenly, a violent earthquake occurs, and a strange black warp appears in the 
middle. The first thing Marche notices is that there must be a crystal here! 
The warp blows off, and swallows you into the abyss...

As the screen fades back in, you should note the difference in the colors. 
Instead of the gray, dark area that held the last crystal, this one is 
colorful, and lively. Butterflies even litter the area. Marche notes as well 
the butterflies, and how different this area is from the last. Luckily, there 
doesn't seem to be any Totema guarding this crystal, so Marche walks up to 
the crystal... But suddenly, a number of Ultima Crystals fade in. Looks like 
it isn't going to be as easy as we expected. 

These strange Ultima Crystals are actually the Totema itself. They are very 
different from the previous Totema, Famfrit, because they are incapable of 
moving. In fact, they are pretty much inanimate objects made to guard this 
second crystal. Wait a second, if they can't move, you can use that to your 
advantage! These Ultima Crystal's only other attack is Logos, an annoying move 
which not only Charms you, but lowers your Attack and Defense. 

There is a very easy way to knock these things out. If you use this strategy, 
the battle becomes that much easier. The idea is to get up right next to the 
Ultima Crystals, while out of the range of the others. The Ultima Crystal you 
are standing next to won't use Logos unless you are at least one tile away. 
Therefore, it will be forced to use its Fight move, which does weak damage. If 
at every turn, you use this strategy, you should be able to get out of this 
battle with all your units intact. Be sure you only send one unit to each 
Ultima Crystal as if you have two against one, it will use Logos. 

Be sure that when you try to take out one Ultima Crystal, you aren't in the 
range of another. The first one you destroy will be the hardest as there aren't
too many areas safe from the Logos of the other ones. Just don't group your 
units together and you should be fine. The Ultima Crystals are annoying, but 
they do have that one weakness. Take advantage of it, and you should win this 
battle with incredible ease.

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]

When the mission is complete, and the second Totema and crystal destroyed, 
Marche wonders which race this Totema represents. With a quick guess of Nu Mou,
the crystal shatters, and something happens. Yes, Mewt appears again, and 
demands to know who is trying to wreck his world. With that, the warp brings
Marche back out to the Roda Volcano...

Once back, Marche recaps on what the heck just happened. Realizing that he
is destroying Mewt's dream by destroying the crystals, he is saddened, not 
only about his actions, but about his crimes against one of his best friends,
Mewt. 

You will now receive the Totema command for the Nu Mou, which is a Target All
MP hurting attack. Place Koringwood on the map wherever you'd like, and check
out the Pub for whatever you'd like. Complete a few more missions, and when
all is done, buy the Magic Wood information, and haul yourself over to the 
Koringwood. 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]
 | Mission : Magic Wood \
 |=======================\

          Difficulty: Slightly Hard
          Enemies:    
                   Archer
                   Sniper
                   Time Mage
                   Black Mage
                   Thief x2
                   Summoner 

Deep in the Koringwood, a group of illegal lumberjacks are cutting down some 
magic wood to sell for a lot of Gil elsewhere. Luckily, Marche walks in within 
the nick of time to quickly stop them. Time to engage. 
          
This time, you are engaging against seven other members, with each being 
pretty strong in his or her own sense. You are allowed five members including 
Marche, so the odds are against you this time. However, if you eliminate the 
biggest threats firsthand, the battle will become much easier. Nevertheless, 
it is never a bad idea to invest a spot for a White Mage. 
          
The first enemies to move will probably be the two Thieves. They aren't the 
most dangerous, so if you don't have to attack them, just ignore them for the 
time being. If you are really paranoid about them stealing something, you can 
always Blind them. The Sniper is fairly dangerous, but doesn't hold too many 
abilities. Now, the Archer however, should be defeated as soon as possible to 
avoid her annoying abilities. 

The remaining units are all magic casters, so they can easily be disabled if 
you can possibly cast some sort of Silence on them. Since Templar's are good 
at this kind of stuff, try to have one with you. Once the Time Mage, Summoner,
and Black Mage are Silenced, they are completely helpless. I'd suggest keeping 
these three Silenced, while you focus on the others. Leave the magic casters 
for last.

The main problem here is numbers. However, even though the opponent outnumbers
you about 5 to 7, you can improvise. Instead of going gun-ho at every enemy 
unit, use status ailmenting attacks to maybe keep them at bay for a few turns. 
Use an Archer or Gunner to Blind your enemies, and the battle is automatically 
yours. If you can use abilities to your advantage, this battle flows much 
quicker. 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]

After defeating these weakling tree-robbers, the local ranger thanks you, and
leaves. Marche begins to ponder to himself; a magic forest. Maybe it has 
something to deal with the next crystal. Whatever the case, the battle is over.
Once back at the world map, place the Salikawood symbol on the map. 

With the Magic Wood mission complete, you can find a lot of other new ones at
the Pub. I'd suggest leveling your clan up to around 11-13 as this next 
mission is going to be tough. With that, choose the mission; Emerald Keep at
the Pub, head to Salikawood for another engagement. 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]
 | Mission : Emerald Keep \
 |=========================\

          Difficulty: Slightly Hard
          Enemies:    
                   Bishop
                   Gunner
                   Alchemist
                   Templar x2
                   Runeseeker (Babus

Trotting slowly into the Salika Keep area, Marche begins his search for this 
"giant emerald crystal." As he rounds the steps, he begins to wonder if this 
is one of those "crystals." An unknown voice will call to you ahead. The 
screen shifts and you will realize that Babus is here as well on Mewt's 
personal orders. Babus will ask of Marche, someone who means the Prince ill. 

Marche however, knows who that person is. In an attempt to get his way out of 
any accusations, Marche immediately tells him not. But his conscience blabbers 
out his words, speaking that he didn't know this was Mewt's world. With that, 
Babus realizes all too well. His group prepares for attack, and you should do 
the same. 
 
With the addition to Marche, the game allows you to bring in five more units 
for battle. The next rounds of battle will be quite difficult, so make sure 
that the units you send in are powerful enough to take out Babus along with 
the rest of his group. (If it is required.) Start the battle, and begin.

Babus the Runeseeker can provide a bunch of problems. His job is unique as you
might already have noticed. His abilities are made up of the R-Ability, Counter
and some other abilities. Explode is a heavy damage spell similar to the 
Sage's Giga Flare; Stillness inflicts Stop status; and Quarter is the same as 
the Time Mage's ability which takes out 1/4 of a particular unit's health.

Along with Babus, which will probably cause you the majority of your problems 
here, you have two Templars, a Gunner, a Bishop, and an Alchemist. Next to 
Babus in amount of difficulty would be both of the "Temple Knights." One is 
armed with Rasp, a MP damaging attack, Cheer which raises Attack statistics, 
Haste which is self-explanatory, and the R-Ability, Bonecrusher. The other 
holds Astra which automatically nullifies status ailments, Warcry which lowers
Speed, Cheer again; which raises Attack, and the S-Ability, Weapon Atk+. 

The Bishop is a rather flexible unit capable of dealing damage, curing his own
allies, and casting Dispel to get rid of all status enhancements. How much you
prioritize him is going to be your call, but remember that as soon as soon as
the Bishop is out, your enemy will not be capable of healing without the help 
of items. The other magic caster, an Alchemist, is much more offensive. You 
will want to especially watch out for Flare or Frog.
 
Lastly, you will find a Moogle Gunner towards the rear. For the most part, his 
abilities are simple, but Stopshot can become annoying, especially with 
Concentrate as a S-Ability. You might find that taking out the Gunner will 
help an amazing amount. Avoid Stopshot or just Blind him to nullify 
Concentrate for hopefully, the future majority of the battle.

The objective here is to defeat Babus and none other. Therefore, unless of 
course you are looking to some experience, I'd suggest you put all your 
emphasis on him. Then again, if you are sure you can't win this battle without 
first taking out the other units, by all means, treat this battle as a clan 
war. 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]

Once Babus is down and out, he will threaten you about hurting the prince. Now
that he knows what you look like, there will be no escape. Running from battle,
Babus teleports out leaving Marche to pity himself. Cold. Just cold. 

Once Emerald Keep is finished, place the Nargai Cave symbol on the map. Some
new missions are just waiting for you to complete so check out the Pub, maybe
capturing a few new areas. Whatever the case, once you are satisfied, choose
Pale Company out of the listings and head over to Nargai Cave.

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]
 | Mission : Pale Company \
 |=========================\

          Difficulty: Hard
          Enemies:    
                   Icedrake
                   Firewyrm
                   Thundrake
                   Totema (Adrammelech)

For this next story mission, Marche enters the Nargai Cave in search of this 
supposed "ghost." A small orb appears in front of Marche, and his reaction is 
a bit puzzling. "Funny, here I am looking at a ghost. But I don't feel scared 
at all." As strange as enigmas can become, the ghost begins to move, and 
Marche follows. With his guard off, Marche is caught by the warp...

As the screen fades back in, you find yourself in yet another temple holding 
probably, another crystal. The ghost has disappeared, but suddenly reappears.
The crystal is up ahead, and the Totema makes his way out. Absorbing the ghost,
the Totema begins to speak of no one but his masters may approach. Confident, 
Marche prepares himself for a battle. Adrammalech prepares himself too, and 
brings in his Dragon fiends. 

This battle is a major step up from the two other "pushover" Totemas you have 
fought in the past. If you had thought they were hard, prepare to be 
obliverated. Bring in five more units (A White Mage or similar would be smart),
and begin the battle. Because the enemy Dragons don't have terribly high 
Speed, you should be able to move first. 

Luckily, the Dragons here aren't anything you haven't seen already. The only 
one which might remotely be a new appearance might be the Thundrake. All three 
of them have elemental Breath attacks for their respectable type (ie. Firewyrm 
holds Fire Breath; Icedrake holds Ice Breath; Thundrake holds Bolt Breath). 
This is basically the only A-Abilities those Dragons hold with exception to 
the Icewyrm who can also cast Mighty Guard on his allies. Geomancy ups Magic 
Power, and Weapon Atk+ ups Weapon Attack obviously.

While the Dragons aren't too tough apart from their Attack power, the Totema 
himself holds some pretty powerful abilities. Not only is he the coolest 
looking Totema, hands down, but his Firestream attack can become devastating. 
Remember Famfrit's Breath of God? Multiply the damage by two, and give it some 
Fire elemental bonus damage to create an A-Ability to be reckoned with. 
Lightspeed is a quick attack nullifying R-Ability, and Howl of Rage lowers 
surrounding unit's Speed. Finally, Soul Sphere hurts your MP so keep your 
mages safe.

The best thing to do would definitely be to inflict a few binding status 
ailments on the initial Dragons. Disable, Immobilize, and Blind all work 
wonders to keep them off your back. You shouldn't need to be bothered by the 
Dragons, as all of your forces should be plopped atop Adrammelech. There 
really isn't too much to explain here, as all you need is a powerful physical 
strike to take out this Bangaa Totema as quickly as possible. 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]

As the battle draws to a close, Adrammelech appears before you and is vaporized
into three of those "ghosts" you saw previously. Marche walks up and realizes
that crystals must be made up of some incredible energy that had created 
everything... The crystal breaks, and Marche is warped out back to Nargai 
Cave.

As he makes his way back out, a certain Nu Mou by the name of Babus appears
to annoy you again. Quickly suspicious of something, Babus questions you. A 
thundering voice will echo through the air... Another warp will appear to 
shimmer, and Mewt appears. The first thing he happens to do is note Babus, but
as of now, Mewt is lost. With that, Babus realizes that you are right. He 
asks what waits of you back home that requires having to pain the prince like
that. Marche doesn't have an answer, and Babus leaves...

Once back on the world map, the new Totema command for the Bangaa race will
appear. Place the new Baguba Port symbol wherever, and head over there. A 
cutscene will be triggered with Marche following Montblanc into the local 
Pub. Montblanc notices a certain Moogle, and learn that this other Moogle is
his brother, Nono. Your companion is instantly happy to see him, but Nono is
depressed. Some bandits have stolen his airship. 

Luckily, Nono knows exactly who these bandits were. However, getting there and
coming out alive is a whole different story. Montblanc will now explain to 
you the Jagds. In those areas, there are no Laws to abide by as the Judges 
simply stay away from those areas. While this may sound all dandy to you, there
is a problem. Without Judges, once your units are KOed, they stay that way. 

Place Jagd Dorsa on the map shortly afterwards, and complete a few more 
missions if you'd like. Once everything is completed, start your first story
mission taking place in the Jagds by simply walking into it...

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]
 | Mission : Jagd Hunt \
 |======================\


          Difficulty: Hard
          Enemies: 
                   Ninja
                   Hunter
                   Antlion
                   Assassin
                   Toughskin
                   Blue Mage

Well, here we are; Jagd Dorsa. You should know already that if anyone gets 
KOed here and you leave them on the ground, they are dead. With that in mind, 
prepare yourself for a rather difficult fight against Nono's enemy bandits.

Because of the Jagd threat here, you might want to bring in a White Mage to 
revive in case your units happen to fall. Pheonix Downs work well too. Make 
sure that the units you send in have high Defense. Paladins or Defenders are 
perfect fitting for this description. You will not want to be killed here, 
especially against this hardcore group...
  
Your enemies consist of mostly clan units, but a few monsters as well. Right 
in front of you at the start are a Ninja who holds Metal Veil, Water Veil, 
and Double Sword which is allows him to hold two swords in two hands for a 
double hit; a Blue Mage with Dragon technique, Mighty Guard, Lamia technique, 
Night, Coeurl technique, Hastebreak, and the Sprite's healing technique of 
White Wind. Along with that, the Hunter boasts a solid Attack statistics and 
holds Sonic Boom, Advice, and Aim: Vitals which inflicts a random status
ailment on you.

An Assassin appears to your left. She can become especially deadly with her 
specialty A-Abilities. Shadowbind Stops a target in its tracks by pinning 
shadow to the ground, Last Breath is an automatic KO (Not good for a Jagd. Oh 
boy.), Aphonia is the standard Silence, and Oblivion Addles the target dis-
allowing them to use any A-Abilities. Don't try any arrows at this mean chick 
unless you want them returned at you. 

The Antlion and Toughskin aren't too much of threats, but should still be 
fought with caution. LV3 Def-less lowers Weapon Defense and Magic Resistance 
to all units with levels divisible by three. Sandstorm is the standard 
whirlwind attack which Blinds targets. The Toughskin doesn't have any new 
techniques. Still holding the original Resonate and Matra Magic, you shouldn't 
have any trouble with it.

You should try to kill off the Assassin and Ninja right off the bat. The 
Assassin has terribly effective A-Abilities, and the Ninja can unleash his 
hurt with Double Sword. Watch out for Last Breath especially, as it 
automatically KOs, and if that unit isn't revived, it's basically lights out 
for that member. The Hunter should be prioritized if you want to avoid random 
status ailments, and the Blue Mage should also be taken out quickly. This 
battle is tough, so don't fret if you mess up a few times. After all, this is 
your first Jagd battle. 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]

Once the battle is finished, Marche suggests heading back to Nono at Baguba
Port. Back on the world map, place the next symbol, Kudik Peaks on the map.
Walk over the Baguba Port, and a cutscene will commence. Nono will become 
ecstatic that you had saved his airship. 

Marche will offer his reward to help Nono fix his airship, but Nono declines
immediately. Convinced, he decides to take it and realizes that he will need
a lot of money. Following, he considers turning it into a merchant ship! A 
pretty good idea for the most part. Back on the world map, you can head to the
local Shops to check out Nono's Trade Items tab. Take the items already there.
From this point on, by connecting with other GBAs, you can get even more rare
items in these slots.

Now take a few more missions and whatnot, and choose The Bounty in the end. 
Engage.

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]
 | Mission : The Bounty \
 |=======================\

          Difficulty: Medium
          Enemies:    
                   Sage
                   Paladin
                   Fighter
                   Red Mage
                   Time Mage
                   Black Mage

You should know the drill by now. Find the unknown wanderer on the world map. 
As soon as you enter the battlefield, you will appear before Clan Ox. There's 
no hostility at first, but one of the grunts notes that this Marche fellow 
looks incredibly alike to that bounty. But guess what! It's you they are 
looking for!

Of all the possibilities, you just had to accept this mission to actually help 
Clan Ox find you. Heh, since we aren't about to let ourselves be turned in, 
we'll fight our way out. Hopefully, you had brought in a healing unit as this 
clan isn't your ordinary pushover. Ranged attackers work well too. 

Your enemies consist of a Sage, a Paladin, a Fighter, a Red Mage, a Time Mage, 
and a Black Mage... phew. From past experience, you might expect the Paladin 
to be the main figure of difficulty here. Although his Attack power is fairly 
high, he lacks in abilities with only Saint Cross and Drop Weapon. He is also 
capable of healing, but barely ever uses that ability.
 
In terms of physical damage, the Fighter might pose a threat. A few standard 
Fighter abilities as well as a high Weapon Attack, you can't go wrong tackling 
him out first. Im terms of actual damage, the Black Mage easily cuts that 
mark. His Magic Power lies in the 200s, and his abilities consist of some 
standard techniques. Much of the time, one of them will be an "-aga" ability. 
If you are unfamiliar with that suffix, just know it is the most powerful of
the elemental spells a Black Mage can throw at you.

Sages normally pose problems, but not this one. Just be thankful this one 
doesn't hold Giga Flare. Reflex negates all Fight moves as you might already 
know, so be sure you actually have some other abilities which can damage the 
Sage. The Red Mage is laughable considering the fact that she doesn't hold 
Doublecast, and her Magic Power is second-rate. Finally, the Time Mage can 
pose some threats. You do not want him to cast Quicken on the Fighter right 
after he damaged your units already. Quick KOs for the enemy.

You will want to Disable the Fighter and Paladin quickly. Following, you can 
choose to Silence everyone else. It would be smart to bring in a utility unit 
to do all those status ailments, followed by your physical and magical 
attackers, followed by a healing unit. If you can set up an attack, you should 
be fine. However, if you just rush in without any strategy, you probably won't 
last that long. This isn't a difficult battle considering it is a story 
battle, so you should be fine. 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]

Well, at least now we know that the Palace has finally put a bounty on your
head. Place Jeraw Sands on the map, and check out the missions at the Pub. 
There is nothing interesting between this transition, so don't look for too
much. When ready, choose Golden Clock, and head over to Jeraw Sands for another
battle. 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]
 | Mission : Golden Clock \
 |=========================\

          Difficulty: Medium
          Enemies:    
                   Juggler
                   Alchemist
                   Time Mage
                   Gadgeteer 

Marche enters the area as he always does and notices Shara coming out from a 
corner. Ritz also appears right behind you, and the two of you greet. Marche 
asks Ritz if she know of the bounty on Marche's head; Ritz responds and tells 
Marche she would never turn him in. They are here instead, for some other
business... 

Ritz runs up and calls the Golden Clock forgers out. Yep, you guessed it, it's 
another battle alongside Ritz. Judging from past experience, this battle 
should be fairly easy considering that you have Ritz and Shara on your side, 
and not to mention that you are up against only four competitors. Bring in 
three extra units and start the battle. 

Your enemies consist of an Alchemist, a Juggler, a Time Mage, and a Gadgeteer. 
The Alchemist holds Meteor which rains a large rock on your units for heavy 
damage, Poison which... well... Poisons of course, and Toad which turns the 
target into a Frog. Whee...! Alongside, you see a Juggler with Hurl which 
throws an item, Firebomb which damages and Berserks, and Ball which Confuses.

The Time Mage can become dangerous if you aren't careful. Demi is extremely 
effective against those with high HP, and Quicken gives a free turn to the 
unit of choice. Also, Slow and Stop are two annoying status ailments you will 
want to avoid at all costs unless you like to lose turns.

Finally, the Gadgeteer is as unpredictable as it is effective. Red Spring 
casts Haste on a random side at the flip of a coin (Just hope that's you), 
Blue Screw casts Dispel on a random side at another flip of a coin (Just hope 
that isn't you), and Green Gear Poisons either side (Again, just hope that 
isn't you). Also, Damage > MP will make striking this Gadgeteer down a trifle 
difficult. 

Without Ritz or Shara, this battle might have caused some problems. But 
because both of your allies are at such high levels with effective abilities, 
you should barely even break a sweat. However, just remember that Ritz and 
Shara can be KOed, and that's when you better do something, or face defeat. 
You can be a bit laid back here, but don't let your guard down. 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]

Afterwards, Marche and Ritz will have a short talk. Marche begins by hoping
that Ritz and Shara won't get in trouble for helping Marche here. Shara then
states that if they came looking for them, they would simply have to turn 
young Marche in. Bowing his head, Marche guesses that he should be leaving. 
Depressed, Marche walks away, and Ritz tells him that she might have to join
sides with Marche. Now, even more depressed, Marche wanders off.

As Marche leaves, Shara tells Ritz that Marche might be worried about her and
asks why she won't help him. Ritz responds coldly asking why. Shara, a bit
surprised at the sudden change of heart, states that if what he says is true,
his family is in the other world. Why wouldn't Ritz want to go back to see her
friends and family? Ritz's answer is strangely enough, her hair; it's no longer 
white. With that, we learn about a whole new side of Ritz. 

Scene shift to Mewt's room. Mewt is angered at how the palace had not found
Marche yet. He asks to know why they hadn't. Nearly throwing a tamtrum, Mewt 
demands that they find him soon. Judgemaster Cid states that he's doing all he
can. Following, a search of every town will commence. Mewt asks his father to
hurry, or the world will break... and suddenly screams for his mother. He 
grabs Babus with a fiery anger and shakes him about, continuously screaming 
for Remedi...

Place Muscadet on the map, and walk over there to trigger a cutscene which
involves Ezel. Marche is surprised to see him here, but Ezel has bad news.
Judgemaster Cid is now searching thoroughly through every clan looking for
this one boy, Marche. It seems that the palace is now more interested in 
getting Marche rather than Ezel anymore. The situation is continually growing 
grim every minute. Complete any random side missions, and get your levels up 
to around 17-18. When that's done, head back to Muscadet, and trigger a 
mission involving that bounty on your head. Prepare yourself for a long 
battle.

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]
 | Mission : Scouring Time \
 |==========================\

          Difficulty: Slightly Hard
          Enemies:    
                   Sage
                   Gunner
                   Paladin
                   Templar x2
                   Mog Knight x2

As you enter Muscadet, an engagement is about to occur. Marche and Montblanc 
appear in the area and witness some Judges and officers of the law bringing 
in random units for questioning. A particular arguement between a Moogle and a
Judge will appear on-screen. The Moogle will ask why he is to be brought in, 
and Judge responds with that the human they are looking for has been seen 
with a Moogle. Unable to take this injustice, Marche runs in...

The first thing he does is exclaim that he is the one Prince Mewt is looking 
for. While the Judge is a bit disbelieving, he still brings in units to 
capture this supposed boy. Units begin to move in, and you will note that you 
are a bit outnumbered. Bring in three extra units with addition to Marche and 
Montblanc and begin the battle with the odds of 5 vs. 7 stacked against you.

Your enemies consist of some powerful units, but the most dangerous of them 
all would be the Paladin or the two Templars. If you care to steal anything, 
you will definitely want the Dragon Mail or Genji Armor. The first enemy unit 
to move will probably be the enemy Paladin or either Mog Knight, but if you 
brought in swift units, you should be able to move first for the most part. 

The two Templars are dangerous with both of them holding the R-Ability, 
Bonecrusher. In addition, both Templars can terrorize you with Astra, Warcry, 
Rasp, Haste, and Lifebreak which can deal incredible damage when you knock off 
a lot of that Templar's HP. The second most dangerous, the Paladin lacks in 
numbers of abilities, but don't let that get your guard off. Holy Blade does 
incredible damage, and Drop Weapon can become annoying.

Also included are two Mog Knights, a Gunner, and a Sage. The Mog Knights are 
pretty much standard issue and shouldn't provide much problems with only Mog 
Attack, Mog Guard, Mog Rush, Mog Lance, Mog Shield, and Mog Aid. By now, you 
should already have many ways to counter-act these kind of abilities. The Sage
is almost laughable with only Drain, Aero, and Bio. Finally, the Gunner isn't 
dangerous as it hasn't learned Concentrate.

At the beginning, begin Disabling and/or Immobilizing the Templar and Bishop 
immediately. Using status ailments can easily turn the tide of battle with 
you. Following, you will want to Blind the Gunner. Deal with the opponents as 
you see fit, but you should try to set up an attack which you know won't fail 
before you attempt something rash. 

But the battle isn't over just yet...

          Difficulty: Hard
          Enemies:    
                   Avatar x8 (Exodus Fruit)
                   Runeseeker (Babus) 

Afterwards, Judgemaster Cid appears on the scene, and begins to question you.
Pretty sure that the boy is the boy, Cid brings him to the prison. There, 
Babus will run in and confirm that the boy is indeed Marche. Now that they 
know, Marche demands that Judgemaster Cid let the others go. Cid will ask 
Marche if he is the one destroying the crystals. Marche confirms, and a seam 
appears mysteriously. Somehow...

The fourth crystal is weak... But you have no access to your clan as of now. 
Babus and Cid are also in the area, and they aren't about to let you destroy 
these crystals in which they had so willingly defended. You guessed it, it's 
another fight with Runeseeker Babus, and this time, he's even more tough. The 
only opposition you will receive here is from Babus. The Totema is weak, and
it can't attack. Since Cid is a Judgemaster (obviously), he will play as Judge 
to make sure the Laws are enforced. Babus is no laughing matter however. This 
battle is a one vs. one... Babus vs. Marche.

Babus's abilities consist of Explode, a deadly Fire elemental move, Stillness, 
which Stops Marche right in his tracks, and Demi which cuts off half of your 
HP right off the bat. In addition, Counter and Weapon Def+ makes him even more 
of an adversary. The key here is to avoid his first move, and follow-up with a 
heavy damage move which you should have at this point for a physical character 
as Marche. Holy Blade or Beatdown would work. However, if you don't have 
access to them, you might have to pick away at Babus's health continuously and
use X-Potions constantly. Defeat Babus and the Fruits to win. 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]

Once all Fruits are destroyed, the crystal flashes, and disappears. 
Dumbfounded, both Cid and Babus watch as another flash from the past appears.
Mewt appears next to his dad, Cid. It's a re-enactment from the opening 
cutscene between Mewt and his dad. Realizing what a loser he once was, Cid
begins to remember, and the gap that was his past life is filled. Saddened,
the Judgemaster decides to leave the palace. Babus will plead the reason why,
and Cid allows Marche to leave.

Now back on the world map, try to leave Sprohm, and a cutscene will commence.
Some locals are gossiping the fact that Cid had finally left the palace. Remedi
and Mewt must be in a furious frenzy. Marche stands nearby, and eavesdrops on
the conversation. What impact could this sudden change and ceceding will this
have on the palace?

Scene shift to Mewt's room. Judgemaster Cid is doing his best to stay on
Mewt's good side. Obviously, he isn't too happy about his father leaving him
in the dark like this. Remedi walks in with a new face. She introduces him
as Llednar Twem, and states that he will be Cid's new replacement. With an
ominous feeling, the screen shifts back to the world map, and you have the
ability to place Uladon Bog anywhere you'd like.

Being the fact that you just completed one of the more important missions of
Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, a handful of new mission are available at the
Pub. Check them out and level all units to about 18. Following, select The
Big Find, and head over to Uladon Bog for another battle.

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]
 | Mission : The Big Find \
 |=========================\

          Difficulty: Slightly Hard
          Enemies:    
                   Thief x2
                   Bishop x2
                   Fighter x2

You all know how I start these story battle things right? "As Marche enters 
the area, he will note... blah blah blah blah." Well, for this battle, Marche 
won't enter the area at first. Therefore, you won't hear me say that. Instead,
the camera brings you to the battlefield and a small conversation between our 
would be competitors. The Fighters hints something about a kid and late. 
Perhaps an ambush? A scout Thief walks in and states that their "pot of gold" 
is here now. 
          
Guess who walks in? Why, if it wouldn't be yours truly, Marche. Seeing as 
he's just been ambushed by a group of six enemies, Marche doesn't appear too
surprised. Just a simple, "Huh?" Anyhow, prepare for another battle. Bring in 
five extra well-rounded units and prepare yourself for battle once again. You 
know the drill by now, don't you?
 
Look at your enemies and you will notice that their line-up is pretty simple 
with two Fighters, two Thieves, and two Bishops. Provide that you actually 
care to know what abilities to avoid, I'll tell you that you really want to 
watch out for Strikeback. Don't make stupid moves when you are already sure 
that it will miss, and you will probably get a nice thwack in the head for 
your imbecile move. The same goes for Bonecrusher, but there are a few ways 
around it.

The opponent's Fighter abilities consist of Rush, Air Render, Far Fist, Wild 
Swing, Beatdown, and Blitz. If you were wondering if both Fighters hold all 
those abilities, the answer is luckily, no. They are split up between them. 
Therefore, if you take out Fighter #1 who has Wild Swing, Far Fist, and 
Beatdown, you won't have to worry about those moves for the rest of the 
mission unless Fighter #1 happens to revive magically.

The Thieves can provide some problems. Both of them hold Steal: Weapon, which 
obviously, steals your weapon. You might want to watch out especially. Even 
worse, Steal: Ability literally "steals" one of your abilities. Therefore, you 
might find it smart to Disable or Immobilize the Thieves from afar. Apart from 
that, you won't see too much damage nor annoyance from them. Just don't let 
your rare weapons get stolen. 
 
The remaining opposition consists of two Bishops. Lucky for you, they aren't 
the most powerful magic casters you might find. Water and Aero do mediocre
damage, and Holy might be the largest damage dealer even though it doesn't do 
THAT high of damage either way. Also, Bishops are capable of using Cura in 
this mission and Judge steals your JP. 

Concern yourself with the Thieves at first. Once the chances of getting 
weapons stolen is at 0% (In short, just KO both Thieves), you can focus on 
the Fighters which are probably attacking your units like mad at that point. 
The Bishops won't provide too much problem, so you might want to leave them 
for last unless you have a masterful plan of your own. Defeat all enemies and 
win the mission. 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]

Afterwards, Marche and Montblanc will mope around. Marche wonders how they
know he was going to possibly be there. There must be some sort of inner ear
which is watching his every move. Suddenly, Marche notes something out of the
back of his eye. Was someone just spying on him right there? Only time will
tell...

Place Gotor Sands on the map and complete a few more side missions. Level up
your party to around 18-19. More missions can be found at the Pub. Be sure 
that you complete the mission, Exploration, to get Jagd Ahli on the world map.
When ready, select Desert Patrol and begin your next mission in the Gotor
Sands area. 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]
 | Mission : Desert Patrol \
 |==========================\

          Difficulty: Medium
          Enemies:    
                   Bishop
                   Dragoon
                   Defender
                   Gladiator
                   White Monk
                   Soldier x2

As you enter Gotor Sands for the Desert Patrol mission, Marche notices a 
certain person... that looks a bit familiar. Walking a bit closer, he 
realizes that it's Doned. Marche is instantly happy to see his brother, but 
Doned remains silent, and runs away. Marche follows and to his surprise, 
sees Doned talking with another group. But even as dumbfounded as he might 
be, Marche realized that his brother had just turned him in for a bounty. 
Just what is going on?

The palace still wants your head, and as obvious, this enemy clan has come to 
challenge you. They were notified of your whereabouts by a certain someone. 
There's nothing else to do but to fight our way out of this trap. Bring in 
six units to go against this enemy group and start the battle. Your foe this 
time is made up of Bangaa and Humans. You will probably notice, that with 
exception to the Bishop, your enemies are all physical. Try to bring in some 
magic-casting units that have moderate Weapon Defense like Morphers or
Sages to counteract their Weapon Attacks, and work upon their weaker Magic 
Resistance.

The White Monk in the front has a bunch of techniques up his alley. Whirlwind 
damages surrounding units, Air Render is a ranged attack, Earth Render deals 
damage to ALL units in front of him, and Far Fist deals ranged splash-damage. 
Luckily, his Weapon Attack is fairly low so don't expect too much from a 
simple Fight move. Behind him is a Gladiator holding the elemental 
"Spellblade" techniques which include Fire Sword, Bolt Sword, and Ice Sword. 
They should be pretty self-explanatory.
  
Two Soldiers make up the Humans of this enemy group. The one closer to you at 
the start holds a few standard "Break" attacks including Powerbreak, 
Mindbreak, and Magicbreak. Provoke Berserks your units so be careful. The 
other Soldier is less of a threat. Luckily, he only can use Powerbreak, 
Mindbreak, and Speedbreak. Mug deals damage but steals Gil at the same time. 
However, that shouldn't be too much of a problem to you.
 
Right smackdab in the center is the Defender. Although his Weapon Attack and 
Defense can be intimidating, his abilities are nothing to be afraid of. Tremor
pushes back all surrounding units, Drop Weapon drops your units' weapons, and 
Mow Down damages all surrounding units, but causes the Defender to lose all 
his Evade for the entire next turn. The Dragoon has even higher Weapon Attack
and his abilities can become particularly exasperating. Lancet drains HP, Fire 
and Bolt Breath are obvious. 

The magic-casting unit of this battle is the Bishop in the front. Luckily, he 
doesn't pose much of a threat compared to the other units. Water is really 
the only damaging spell he holds. Dispel clears all status enhancements and 
Break inflicts Petrify on your units. Keep in careful mind that once the 
Bishop is defeated, your opponent will have no means of healing apart from 
having to use items.

I always prefer to take out the magic-caster, seeing as once he's down and 
out, the battle will move much quicker. Therefore, your opponent must rely on 
physical strength to overcome you. Since for the most part, Weapon Defense is 
higher than Magic Resistance for this enemy group, magic spells work wonders. 
Watch out for the Bishop's Return Magic however. As you progress through the 
battle, it will become easier and easier until you win. 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]

I bet none of you would have ever expected Marche's own brother to turn on
him like that. Nevertheless, Marche fails to really gain any legitimate 
information out of the Bangaa afterwards. At the world map, place Delia Dunes
on a tile. Complete the side missions which present themself if you'd like, 
and select the next story mission, Quiet Sands. Be sure to complete the
missions: Wyrms Awaken, Ruby Red, and A Dragon's Aid to unlock the Ozmonfield
symbol. 

Then head over to Delia Dunes for the fifth and final crystal battle. 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]
 | Mission : Quiet Sands \
 |========================\

          Difficulty: Medium
          Enemies: 
                   Templar x2
                   Titania x2
                   Biskmatar (Llednar)

The Delia Dunes have stopped barking. Enter the area and Marche will complain 
about the lack of sound. As he is about to walk out however, a certain Llednar 
happens to waltz in. Marche has never seen this monster before so he is a bit 
confused. With a simple, yet powerful order, Llednar tells Marche to get out 
of here. Just before Llednar pushes him out, a seam opens...

Yes, here it is. The fifth and final crystal is just up ahead. The Llednar 
dude is nowhere in sight however. Quietly, Marche disregards him and 
continues. Just up ahead, to Marche's great dismay, is the strange man again. 
With another order, Llednar orders you to go no further. With a final blow, 
Llednar attempts to put Marche in his place...

Suddenly, a commanding voice streaks through the air. Judgemaster Cid has just 
appeared in the nick of time to stop Llednar and his deadly intentions. With 
an antilaw, the Judgemaster places a law on Llednar's most powerful attack, 
Omega. Disabled, Llednar continues to fight, and Marche chooses to stay. 
Prepare yourself... against Biskmatar Llednar. 

While Llednar summons two Templars and two Titanias, you should send in five 
units of your own. The Templars are both formidable opponents. With heavy 
Weapon Attack, they can easily chop through your units like a butter knife 
through butter. If you bring in any Mages, watch out for Silence, and their 
MP damaging attacks, Soul Sphere and Rasp. Astra is a special status 
enhancement that automatically nullifies the first status ailment against that 
unit. Lifebreak deals lost HP in damage, and Warcry lowers Speed of all
surrounding units.

The two Titanias aren't as dangerous in terms of Weapon Attack, but LV?D Holy 
will still pose problems. If the day of month matches your unit's level, 
prepare for some heavy Holy damage against you. Angel Whisper both heals HP 
and casts Auto-Life on one of their allies. The last of the units, Llednar 
himself, is no pushover. He holds incredible Weapon Attack. Even without 
Omega, he is a major problem.
       
First off, his lineup of abilities is very deadly. Abyss acts like a Sage's
Bio, damaging and Poisoning at the same time. Life Render deals damage and 
Dooms Llednar's targets. Heart Render deals MP damage. Ripcircle acts by 
damaging all surrounding units. And finally, Furycircle deals damage to all 
surrounding units as well as knocking them back. However, if you attempt to 
damage Llednar, you will find that no matter what you use, Llednar cannot be 
killed.
          
Therefore, it is impossible to defeat the boss. Luckily, there is a way to win 
out. Wait out the battle by defeating Llednar's allies, and Cid will 
eventually banish Llednar with a Red Card. With that freak gone, Marche may 
continue. To his great dismay however, the Totema itself still awaits. 

          Difficulty: Hard
          Enemies: 
                   Vampire x4
                   Totema (Mateus)

With Llednar defeated for the time being, the final crystal awaits. As a 
precaution, Judgemaster Cid asks if Marche would like to leave. Knowing his 
destiny, Marche rightfully declines. Leading him into the final room, Cid 
states that the final crystal is here. The Totema appears as expected, the 
Totema of the Humans. Mateus will suddenly turn into Ritz, then Doned, then 
Mewt, and then Marche himself. Knowing that this is just a mind-trick, Marche 
disregards it. The fight will begin.

The four figures will turn into four Vampires. Mateus herself appears in the 
center. Seeing as this is the toughest of the Totemas, take necessary 
precautions with the units you choose to send in. I would strongly suggest a 
White Mage against the Vampires and very strong physical attackers.

Mateus has summoned four Vampires to help her out. They are very dangerous and 
can prove quite a bit of exasperation. Although the abilities vary from 
Vampire to Vampire, you will especially want to watch out for LV? S-Flare 
which deals damage to all units with the same one's digit as them. Zombify 
turns your allies into Zombies, and Miasma inflicts damage and possible Poison 
status. 

Mateus herself is quite a difficulty. With HP in the 400s, she obviously 
won't be too easy to take down. Weapon Attack is actually in 400s as well! 
With a single strike, she can easily KO weaker units. Spellbind is an ability 
that damages and Slows. Breath of God is a heavy damage radius attack. Star 
Cross is the same as the Illusionist ability damaging all units with Holy 
damage. Thundaga is fairly self-explanatory.

Before actually sending in your units, I would suggest using a White Mage to 
cast Protect and Shell on them. Therefore, they have a higher chance of 
surviving Mateus' damaging attacks. If you really want to win, I would suggest 
bypassing the Vampires altogether. Blind them or Disable them to make them 
useless and begin going gun-ho at Mateus. There really is no trick. To defeat 
this Totema, you are going to need to be a bit more diligent. Good luck. 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]

With Mateus defeated, the crystal will be destroyed. Ecstatic, Marche realizes
that the world should now go back the way it was! However, nothing is 
happening. Marche questions the problem, and Cid states that it was the last
of them. Why are we still here? A voice booms through the air stating that
this world is still wanted. With that, Queen Remedi appears: 
 
                     "Even without the world-threads binding 
                      it... As long as this world is wanted,
                      it will exist."

Marche realizes that Queen Remedi is Mewt's mother... If Mewt is to want this
world to exist, the world will stay the way it is. If Mewt continues to want
this world to stay, the world will remain the way it is. Marche realizes that
he himself also wants this world to stay. With those strong words, she 
disappears... leaving Marche with a new objective. He has to talk to Mewt!

Back on the world map, haul yourself over to any Pub and listen in on a 
conversation. It's Audience Day as Montblanc states. People bring gifts to the
palace, and can easily make connections. Marche figures out a new plan. To
carry it out however, he is going to need the help of Montblanc's brother, 
Nono. Place the Materiwood symbol on the map. 

Complete side missions and level everyone up to 21-23. When ready, select
Materite Now! and head over to the Materiwood for the next mission. 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]
 | Mission : Materite Now! \
 |==========================\

          Difficulty: Slightly Hard
          Enemies:   
                   Sniper
                   Summoner
                   Assassin
                   Red Mage
                   White Mage
                   Elementalist

Marche has successfully located a bit of Materite in the Materiwood. As so 
far, no opposition has been encountered so from here on, it's smooth sailing. 
However, from his rear, Marche notices a clan of Viera bandits. How could they 
have known he was here? The streetear of course was Doned. Nothing we can do 
now but engage. 

Six units should be brought in. You might want to work for units that are 
carrying items making them immune to status ailments; you should especially 
prioritize instant KO. The Assassin is bound to give you a few problems with 
that. Shadowbind and Last Breath are the two that you should avoid as best as 
possible. Shadowbind Stops units right in their tracks and Last Breath deals 
an instant KO. That is not something you want happening. 

The ranged Sniper will also provide a bunch of problems. Aim: Armor, Aim: 
Weapon, and Aim: Wallet destroys the item that they obviously shoot at. Once a 
weapon is destroyed, it cannot be used again which makes Aim: Weapon 
especially annoying if your unit is carrying a rare weapon. If you are going 
to knock the Sniper into critical HP, be sure that you avoid Doom Archer which 
deals the lost HP into offensive damage. The move also affects MP. Either KO 
her within one turn or Disable her one way or another.

The rest of this Viera group consists of magic-casters. The Elementalist, 
capable of using Spirit Magic, will be a major problem for you. Unless you use 
a Status law card, prepare to fall to her various "Elemental damage + Status 
ailment" spells. Shining Air deals Wind damage and Blind at the same time. 
Evil Gaze deals Dark damage and can Confuse. Heavy Dust is a Earth spell that 
Immobilizes and finally, Sliprain deals Water elemental damage and Slows 
targets down.

Behind her, the Red Mage reigns supreme as the Doublecasting maniac. 
Doublecast allows her to send out two spells in one, single turn. However, you 
can rid her of that ability by simply stealing her Madu (Rapier). Because she 
hasn't mastered Doublecast, stealing her weapon will prevent her from using an 
unmastered ability. Even with Doublecast however, the Red Mage still won't 
pose much of a threat with Fire, Thunder, Sleep, and Poison. KO her whichever 
way you choose.

The Viera Summoner is your standard, generic enemy. Remember that Summon 
spells have a much larger radius of effect than normal spells. All spells will 
affect units two tiles out horizontally and vertically and one tile diagonally 
on each corner. If you group your units together, your Summoner will wreak 
havoc. Make sure she doesn't take the best of you. Madeen, dealing heavy Holy 
damage, will be very hard to recover from. And finally, the White Mage has
four simple yet powerful spells. Curaga cures HP, Esuna heals status, 
Auto-Life revives to full HP, and Shell protects from harmful magic spells. 

The way you choose to tackle this battle is your choice. I always like to take 
down the Assassin first followed by the White Mage. Without the White Mage, 
your enemy team is incapable of reviving fallen allies as well as becoming 
very lacking in the ability to heal. The Assassin should be taken down early 
just to avoid her dark techniques. As a possible strategy, group all your 
enemies by the cliff in the northwest corner and push them off for heavy 
damage and of course, lots of laughs. 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]

Defeating Doned's plan, Marche calls out to his brother. Appearing from 
behind, Marche's brother gives him a nice thwack on the head. Instead of 
anger, Marche is instantly happy to see him. However, Doned did take the 
Materite from him... with a quick lunge, he chucks it toward making it explode
into pieces. Surprised at this treason, Marche demands to know what has gotten
into his brother. Doned apparently, has very similar intentions to Ritz. He
wants this world to stay too... There's nothing left for him in the other 
world. The thought of being left with nothing... Doned runs off, and Marche
bows his head. Giving a final subtle statement, Marche speaks of one thing
Doned has that Marche had always wanted...

Back on the world map, Bervenia Palace will automatically place itself on the
world map. More missions can be found at the Pubs, however, stepping into 
Bervenia Palace will automatically trigger the next mission, Present Day. 
When you feel ready for the next mission (It's sort of a toughie), step into
the capital of Ivalice and engage. 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]
 | Mission : Present Day \
 |========================\

          Difficulty: Slightly Hard
          Enemies:   
                   Templar
                   Alchemist
                   Mog Knight
                   Gladiator x2

Despite the "run-in" with Doned, Marche and Montblanc were still able to get 
Nono to make them a legitimate gift in time for Present Day. At the start, 
Montblanc will comfort Marche on the fact that the palace won't even recognize 
him. Walking a bit forward, the two of them enter the palace... Nono's gift, 
the "Lugaborg" is sure to get them in. 

In the palace waiting room, Marche begins to complain about the waiting time. 
Everyone else has already gone. Montblanc responds suggesting that something 
may be... wrong? If there was some kind of trouble, then the two of them were 
in deep waters indeed. Behind them, a door opened and a group of palace guards 
enter. It seems that they've figured out who you are. A tip from a concerned 
citizen was their lead; the concerned citizen obviously being Doned.

This battle may be a bit problematic because of the tiny size of the arena 
(Heck, we are fighting in the palace waiting room). Luckily, the opposition 
has the same problem as well. If you bring in a Summoner, you can probably 
expect your enemies to be grouped up together. When they do just that, give 
them a full-powered taste of Madeen or Ifrit. Because of the lack of space, 
magic units would do very well. However, be sure to not group up your units 
either or you might be forced to make sacrifices.

Leading the offensive, the Bangaa Templar is nightmarishly strong. He excels 
at Weapon Attack and Weapon Defense so you might want to Disable him before 
he gets too far. Because of Bonecrusher which counter-attacks with an added 
1.5x to Weapon Attack, avoid close-range attacks. Ability-wise, Astra 
nullifies the first status ailment against an unit, Warcry lowers Speed of 
surrounding units, Rasp deals MP damage, and Haste speeds an unit up.

The two Gladiators can be dealt with much quicker, but their Weapon Attack are 
really high. The elemental "Spellblade" attacks will be sure to pose some 
problems for your units. The standard Rush, Beatdown, and Blitz abilities make 
their appearance as well. Do take precautions when using the Fight move at 
close range. The Reaction Ability, Strikeback, will nullify the incoming 
attack at weapon range as well as following up with an attack of their own. 
With Weapon Attack in the 340s, you will by all means want to avoid that.
 
The only Moogle here plays his role as a Mog Knight. Mog Attack pushes units 
back one tile while damaging, Mog Lance is a ranged attack, Mog Rush is a 
generic high-powered and low-accuracy attack, Mog Shield helps defend by 
casting Protect and Shell on himself, and Mog Aid heals HP. However, although 
Mog Knights are normally dangerous, the lack of Reaction Ability or Ultima 
Charge makes this Moogle a bit less threatening. Nonetheless, take necessary 
precautions and watch it. 

The only magic-caster plays an Alchemist jobset. You will want to especially 
watch out for Death, which will deal an instant KO. However, if you notice 
that Death has not been mastered yet, know that if the Life Crosier is stolen,
the enemy Alchemist will have no access to that move. Use that to your 
advantage. Other abilities consist of Flare which deals heavy damage, Poison 
which of course, Poisons, and Toad which inflicts Frog status on an enemy 
unit.

As stated before, magic-casters or radius-damage attacks work very well in 
such a small arena. The Templar will most likely play the battle by casting 
Haste on his allies. The three Bangaas are the ones you want to watch out for. 
All three have very high Weapon Attack which can be devastating to the magic 
unit lacking in Weapon Defense. Once those three are out of the way however, 
the remaining portion of the battle is a cakewalk. 

          Difficulty: Hard
          Enemies:    
                   Biskmatar (Llednar)

With the inital opposition defeated, more guards begin to run in. By now, it 
seems as if getting through would be impossible. Suddenly, Mewt's Nu Mou 
servant, Babus, appears. Instead of going against you however, Babus Stops 
the guards right in their tracks. Confused by this sudden change of position, 
Marche asks Babus why he's helping him. Responding, the Nu Mou states that he 
wishes to know more about what is going on with these "worlds." 

Babus soon warps you to the Prince's throne room. Mewt is pacing along. Babus
brings Marche up, and Mewt is instantly angry to see him. Knowing he hasn't 
got much time, Marche tries to reason with Mewt as quickly as possible. Mewt 
realizes that even Babus is now against him. Before Mewt could be changed, 
Remedi warps in to comfort him. However, Mewt is taken away... and Marche is 
left with nothing...

To add insult to injury, Llednar has been summoned to rid the palace of this 
presense. Babus agrees to help, but Marche tells him to try to trace where
Mewt and the Queen had gone. However, as of now, Marche must engage with 
Llednar... You should notice that the barrier protecting Llednar from damage 
is still active. Therefore, the objective is not to win, but to SURVIVE. The 
amount of turns required is five, but that won't be easy. 

The main difficulty with this mission is the fact that Llednar will most 
likely take the first turn. However, if you leveled up Marche as a Thief or a 
Ninja, you might prevail and take the first turn. If you aren't faster, then 
pray that Llednar doesn't use Omega. If he lands that, the battle is already 
over. Use your turns wisely by running away from Llednar every single turn. 
In order for Llednar to use Omega, he has to be right next to you. 

Therefore, I recommend that for your first turn (If you survived), you run in 
the opposite direction. Therefore, Biskmatar Llednar will be forced to use 
Abyss which Poisons and damages. However, that is easily solved with Potions. 
Spend five turns running away from Llednar if you want to win. In the end, 
the Judgemaster will make his presense, and the battle is over... 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]

Llednar, knowing the danger that Judgemaster Cid poses, instantly warps out.
The first question that the Judgemaster asks of Marche is the location of 
Mewt. Marche then tells Cid what has happened over the course of the last
hour. However, Marche has one question of his own. Who is Llednar?

                                "He's Mewt."

Surprised at this strange answer, Marche is instantly stupefied. Judgemaster
Cid further reinforces it by stating that Llednar is basically an aspect of
Mewt. Although Mewt himself has never shown such a violent personality, 
Llednar proves that Mewt, by alls means, is capable. Llednar is like the 
Totemas; he was designed for the sole purpose to protect Mewt and the crystals
that bind the world together...

Cid agrees to help Babus and disembark in search of Mewt. Marche agrees to 
these terms, and decides that he should talk to Ritz and Doned. He feels that
before he attempts to persuade Mewt, he must first persuade his friend and 
brother. Judgemaster Cid takes his leave, and Marche is left to complete his
tasks. 

Once the mission is complete and over with, place Tubola Cave on the world 
map. Many sub-missions are making their first appearance at the Pubs. Whether
you choose to deal with them or not, make sure that you select Hidden Vein
and continue with your quest. Also, to unlock Jagd Helje, complete Mission
#64 Den of Evil. 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]
 | Mission : Hidden Vein \
 |========================\

          Difficulty: Medium
          Enemies:    
                   Sage
                   Juggler
                   Animist
                   Blue Mage
                   Mog Knight
                   White Monk

Now that we're out mythril hunting, Doned will be sure to try to interfere 
again. Marche walks into the Tubola Cave area pretending to be searching for
mythril. A voice splits the area. "Stop! Thief!" Marche is dumbfounded. The 
enemy group states that Marche is stealing their mythril. Apparently, Doned 
has turned him in... again! Surrounded, Marche has no other options but to 
engage. 

When you bring in your units, be sure that you position them so they can take
attacks from both sides. With three units on one side and three units on the 
other, your position is flanked. The first of your opponents to move would 
most likely be the Moogle Juggler. The Knife that he holds is one of the 
strongest in this game. You can easily disable his Weapon Attack by simply 
stealing it. Watch out for Dagger which damages and Disables. Firebomb can be 
annoying as it Berserks and damages while Smile automatically gives one of
allies the next turn.

The Sage will become a pit of many of your problems. Giga Flare is one of the 
most powerful magic spells a Nu Mou has to offer. This move is also second to 
Ultima Blow in terms of damage. If you group your units together, Giga Flare 
can affect all of them as it is capable of dealing damage to multiple units. 
The last unit on the east side is a Mog Knight. Mog Guard is used to guard 
himself. Mog Rush deals heavy damage at the cost of lowered accuracy, Mog 
Shield automatically nullifies one status ailment, Mog Peek detects hidden
items, and Mog Aid heals HP and status.

A Bangaa White Monk leads an offensive to the west. Earth Render can damage 
all units directly in front of that unit. It can be devastating if you don't 
watch your unit placement. The White Monk is also capable of reviving fallen 
allies with Revive. Next on the list is the Moogle Animist. You should avoid 
Tail Wag, a Charming move, and Friend, a completely wildcard ability with 
unpredictable results. Finally, the Blue Mage finishes off the set with 
various Blue Magic techniques. Twister cuts off 1/2 HP right off the bat. 
Bad Breath will deal multiple status ailments. Roulette KOs a random unit on 
the field. And White Wind will heal the amount of HP he has remaining.

This battle isn't that tough. The only real problematic units would be the 
Sage or the Blue Mage. The latter can wreak havoc with Bad Breath and 
Roulette. However, ban Color Magic with a law card and his abilities go down 
the drain. Likewise, ban Skills and the Sage is disabled in terms of using his
Sagacity Skill. Overall, this story mission is nothing tough. What is soon to 
come however, will be. 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]

Once the enemy force is defeated, Marche will call out to Doned. Walking in,
Marche's little brother realizes that this was basically a trick to get Doned
out of hiding. Still reluctant to go come, Doned refuses to go home. However,
Marche states to Doned that he had always had the attention. As a single 
mother, Marche was always swept to the side while Doned received all that he
wanted. Realizing his error, Doned sadly apologizes and agrees to help Marche
change back the world...

Now back on the world map, the Deti Plains symbol can be placed anywhere to
your liking. Find yourself a Pub to walk into and a cutscene will commence. 
Doned has agreed to take your side. As of now, he is helping you out with your
mission. As they discuss possibilities, a Bangaa walks in with a message to
Marche. It's from Judgemaster Cid. Apparently, Babus and Cid have discovered
Mewt's location. The Queen and the Prince are both hiding out in Ambervale. 
With one step done, Cid asks of you to meet him on the Deti Plains.

Once you walk into the Deti Plains area, the next battle will automatically
begin. However, before you do that, I'd suggest completing side missions and
leveling up your clan to ready yourselves for the next mission and the 
ultimate final battle which is soon to come. 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]
 | Mission : To Ambervale \
 |=========================\

          Difficulty: Medium
          Enemies:    
                   Coeurl
                   Lilith
                   Thundrake
                   Jawbreaker
                   Big Malboro

On our way to the Deti Plains, Marche comes across a group of monsters in his 
path. What comes next should be drilled in your head by now. Bring in another 
five units in addition to Marche himself. Before we can find Judgemaster Cid, 
we are going to have to take care of this monster threat first. Cid hasn't 
arrived yet so take your time. As a story mission, you can already expect 
these monsters to be a bit tougher than some normal engagement. 

The nearest target, a Coeurl stands valiantly. Blaster is his only technique,
but each casting will Petrify an unit. Being a ranged ability, keeping your 
units away won't always help. Therefore, I'd suggest taking it down before a 
chance to use it is taken. Even so, its Weapon Attack power is fairly high. 
Ridding the battlefield of the Coeurl first will make advancing through the 
arena much easier as there won't be any opposition blocking the front-lower 
area.

I normally get stuck up at bottom where the waterfall hits the edge of the 
map. Usually, if you take down the Coeurl, you can avoid any pre-battle 
traffic jams. However, you might still find that the Jawbreaker attempts to 
impede your path very often. If any of your units have levels divisible by 
three or five, watch out for LV3 Def-less and LV5 Death. The latter provides 
instant death to all units with levels divisible by five and LV3 Def-less 
lowers the Defense and Resistance of all units with levels divisible by three.
Even worse, they both have a 100% chance of hitting if the levels pertain
correctly.
 
By this point, you should be nearing the west side of the arena and beginning 
to climb the steps up to the higher level. The Big Malboro will be a nuisance
with Bad Breath. In short, it is capable of inflicting a large number of 
status ailments on you with one cast. Soundwave is less of a problem as it 
only Dispels any status enhancements. Further up, a Lilith reigns supreme. 
Avoid being caught at distances with Twister. Poison Frog inflicts Poison and
Frog status while Kiss inflicts Doom and Charm.

I always prefer to take this battle on in order. The monsters aren't too smart
and usually stick to their area. If you take out the monsters as they come, 
the battle will flow through. Unless you are wearing Galmia Shoes (In which 
you can just jump up the cliff), you will need to transcend through the path
anyway. You should end at the Thundrake. If you have retained most of your 
units while pushing through, it will fall easily despite holding Bolt Breath 
and Geomancy. 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]

Arriving right after the battle, Cid appears. Marche asks Cid if he has met
Mewt and the Queen yet. The Judgemaster shakes his head and asks Marche a 
favor. What he needs is some amber from Siena Gorge. Cid has begun to plot 
with Ezel. Marche is obviously surprised at the fact that a Judgemaster would
go to such lengths as creating an antilaw. Marche agrees to the objective
and the two of them part again.  

... As they both walk off in separate directions, a certain pink-haired girl
appears. What could her intentions possibly be?

Siena Gorge must now be placed on the map. A number of new missions are now
available at the Pub. Complete them to whatever extent you'd like. If you 
step into Siena Gorge, you will automatically engage in battle so make sure
you are completely ready. For starters, I'd recommend leveling up all your 
units to at least 26-27. When ready, head into Siena Gorge. 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]
 | Mission : Over The Hill \
 |==========================\

          Difficulty: Hard
          Enemies:    
                   Fencer
                   Summoner
                   Assassin
                   Elementalist
                   Sniper (Shara)
                   Red Mage (Ritz)

Our last stop before we head off to Ambervale is Siena Gorge. There, we are to 
find some amber for Judgemaster Cid to create the antilaw he needs. Entering 
the Siena Gorge, a pink-haired girl stands valiantly at the top of a large 
pass. Laughing for a second, Ritz is positioned with her clan. Next to her is
Shara. With a sense of confidence, Ritz states that when Marche might be 
engaging them, it just seems kind of funny. 

A surprising turn of events, huh? Ritz had never wanted to go back home, so 
this battle was sure to come eventually. Marche enters and realizes what is 
about to commence. For the next engagement, they are no longer aquaintenences. 
Marche is going over that hill. Ritz however, will use all her power to stop 
that. Knowing that she won't give up now, Marche prepares to engage. Bring in 
five additional units and the epic battle between Marche and Ritz will begin.

We had never battled Ritz and her clan before, so this might be something new. 
Ritz's clan consists of Viera only. She does well with a good balance between 
magic and physical units. You should do the same. At the start of the battle, 
climb up the hill to meet Clan Ritz at the edge. Try not to move further onto 
the wooden bridge as traffic jams will be sure to start there. Instead, stay 
back and let Ritz come to you.

Now that you are in a good position to start your offensive from, begin to 
build up your units and prepare to attack. The first of Clan Ritz to most 
likely move would be the Assassin. With 200 points in Speed, she can move 
pretty fast. Even so, the Ninja Tabi allows her to move 6 tiles which can 
become pretty threatening. Do not let her get behind you and use Last Breath. 
Aphonia is only dangerous to magic units as it Silences and Rockseal can 
Petrify units into stone. Oblivion works by Addling a target.

The Fencer has mediocre Weapon Attack for a physical unit. Luckily, she is 
fairly lacking in abilities. Swallowtail damages surrounding units, 
Piercethrough works like a Spear-jab by dealing damage to two units directly 
in front of her, and Nighthawk is a ranged attack. Of the magic-casters, the 
Summoner will be sure to pose a few problems with her Summon spells. Madeen 
will deal incredible Holy damage. Also, her castings can deal damage to all 
units two tiles away and one tile diagonally from the center of damage. Don't
group your units together and her spells will be less devastating.

Taking up a particularly problematic position, the Elementalist will be sure 
to get in your way. Because all of her techniques have status ailments 
connected (With exception to White Flame), you will not only be struck by 
magic, but also inflicted with certain status ailments. Fire Whip deals Fire 
damage and can also Disable an unit. Shining Air will deal Wind damage along 
with Blinding a target. Heavy Dust deals Earth damage with a chance of 
Immobilizing. Beware of the Elementalshift as well. Once through, you might be 
taking heavy damage because of taking elemental weaknesses that Elementalshift
exploited.

Ritz's right-hand man (or in this case, Viera) is apparent as a Sniper. Her 
Weapon Attack is high enough to prove a difficulty. Even so, her abilities are 
ones to watch out for. I'd mostly recommend banning Missile attacks altogether 
(Law Card). However, if that can't possibly apply to you, I'd suggest you take 
her down fast. Death Sickle will inflict Doom status from far away. Doom
Archer deals lost HP in damage against. Aim: Weapon and Aim: Armor will 
destroy the selected item. The last two should be taken with caution if you 
are wearing or wielding any valuable weaponry or clothing.

Finally, the boss herself plays a role as a Red Mage. Ritz is no easy matter 
to overcome. Her Weapon Attack is mediocre, but you will hardly see her 
actually using Fight moves. As a Red Mage, it is true that Doublecast is 
apparent. With it, she can cast Fire, Thunder, or Blizzard against you for 
offensive damage. Magic Pow+ boosts the Magic Power and therefore makes each 
hit hurt. Be wary of "Sleep + Offensive Magic" combos as well. Being put to 
Sleep can make a unit vulnerable to spells right off the bat. Simply
Silencing her wouldn't work as Ribbon nullifies all status ailments. Not good.

The main objective is defeating Ritz. Being at the front of the group, that 
objective is easily accomplished if you just feel like rushing through the 
mission. While you fight however, I'd suggest you Steal some of the items 
around. Max's Oathbow, SeventhHeaven, and Ritz's Femme Fatale are all very 
useful items to take. Defeat Ritz to take her down. The pass... is now clear. 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]

The battle is now over... 

As the dust settles, Ritz turns her back on Marche. Unable to stop him... 
Unable to prevail... With her defeat, you are allowed to pass and continue.
Marche leaves the area while Ritz and Shara are left by themselves. Ritz now
realizes that Marche has transformed from the new kid back in St. Ivalice.

The final battle is up ahead. When you are ready, head to Ambervale... and
prepare for the final fight. 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]
 | Mission : Royal Valley \
 |=========================\

          Difficulty: Hard
          Enemies:   
                   Ninja
                   Gunner
                   Assassin

                   Illusionist
                   Biskmatar (Llednar)

Finally, after many obstacles, we find ourselves in the final chapters... 
Ambervale... the Royal Valley. As Marche is led into the area, he denotes the 
beauty of this palace. Judgemaster Cid has located Mewt to this position. As 
the two walk forward, the music stops as they discover Babus lying unconscious 
on the ground. An unknown voice states the fact that he isn't dead... yet.

Llednar again. As always, he is here for trouble. Not letting you pass, Cid 
pulls out a special Law Card. With the cast, all Laws protecting Llednar are 
nullified. The invincible barrier surrounding Llednar will break. Now 
vulnerable to attack, the Biskmatar still fights. Bringing in his units, the 
battle will begin. This time however, you won't be running away from Llednar. 
Now, you must fight him... and thus, defeat him. You have the option of 
sending in three units of your choice. Unless you want to take Llednar on 
singlehandedly, I'd suggest you take advantage of that. A White Mage will be 
very logical for the incoming fight. 

The Biskmatar's group consists of a Ninja, a Gunner, an Assassin, an 
Alchemist, and an Illusionist. The first three are the main difficulty. The 
Ninja is capable of using Double Sword. From past experience, you know that 
two high-powered Katanas against you will generate a lot of hurt. Along with 
that, watch out for his ranged "Veil" attacks. Fire Veil deals Fire elemental 
damage and will Confuse an unit. Earth Veil uses Earth elemental damage and 
can Slow a target. Water Veil deals Water damage and will Silence a target. 
Finally, Oblivion inflicts Addle status on an enemy which disallows them to 
use Action Abilities. 

The Moogle Gunner is sure to pose some problems. His ability line-up consists 
of Charmshot, Blindshot, Silenshot, and Stopshot. Luckily, he doesn't have 
Concentrate so he can easily be counteracted by Blinding him. The nearby 
Assassin can be particularly dangerous using her Corner techniques. Take 
caution and watch out for Nightmare and Rockseal. No Last Breath makes her 
much less dangerous. Even so, her abilities will give you many problems if you
aren't careful.

The two magic-casters of this group are an Illusionist and an Alchemist. The 
latter of the two is capable of instant KO with Death along with heavy damage 
through Flare. Toad should also be taken with caution as it turns his target 
into a Frog. The Illusionist is a master of Phantasm Magic. Included are 
Prominence which deals Fire damage to all units, Tempest which deals Lightning
damage to all units, Stardust which rains meteors down on all units, Soil 
Evidence which deals Earth damage to every unit, and Wild Tornado which 
initiates Wind damage on all units.

Finally, Biskmatar Llednar plays a role as the boss. Now that he can be hurt, 
you should no longer run from him. (Remember the Present Day battle?) Wielded 
are a few useful items. Excalibur is a high-powered Knightsword and Peytral 
is a rare piece of Armor. Ability-wise, there's nothing stopping Llednar from 
using Omega now. Heavy damage will most likely KO your units within a single
strike. Do your best to avoid that. Life Render will damage and Doom. Don't 
try to surround him either as Furycircle will just push them all back.

This battle is over once Llednar is defeated. Go gun-ho against him and he'll 
fall beneath your blade. Without his barrier, he will be vulnerable to defeat. 
With that, he crumbles and shall live no more...

          Difficulty: Hard
          Enemies:    
                   Battle Queen (Queen Remedi)
                   Dephs x2 (Famfrit/Adrammelech)

It turns out that Babus was really just knocked out. Marche succeeds in waking 
him up luckily. The first thing he asks is where the Prince is. We still 
hadn't gone inside yet so we couldn't have completed our task yet. Babus 
cannot fight anymore. He stays behind while both Marche and Cid venture inside 
the chapel. Once inside, the two of them meet Remedi. With that, she 
reinforces the fact that this world is still an illusion. At the same time, 
Marche demands to know where Mewt is. The Queen then states that even Marche 
isn't ready to let this world go. Being the moral person he is, Marche 
admits to liking this world. However, it isn't real. Mewt's voice booms 
through the air. Suddenly, he appears in the hand of the statue ahead. Mewt 
still doesn't want to leave...

Now Queen Remedi is obligated to use any means necessary in order to extract 
Marche from this area. With that, she transforms into Battle Queen mode and 
summons two Dephs, her own creatures of incredible power. Prepare to fight
Battle Queen Remedi and her two creations, a resurrection of Famfrit and 
Adrammelech. They still have their own tricks up their sleeve. If you ever 
want to go back, you must defeat the Queen.

Famfrit on the right is basically a more powerful version of the first Totema 
we had battled. However, you will note that his level and stats have gone up 
considerably. If you thought he was difficult before, now he will be a 
nightmare. Breath of God is still in his ability line-up. Still capable of 
using that destructive casting, expect heavy damage. Lightspeed works a lot 
like Greased Bolt or Faster by delivering an attack that bypasses R-Abilities. 
Presense deals damage and knocks a target back one tile. You should already
be aware of what Demi does. Cutting off 1/2 an unit's HP will hurt.

In addition to that monster, Adrammelech of the Bangaas will aid Remedi and 
your destruction. Lightspeed is the same move that Famfrit. Firestream is a 
high-powered Fire attack that deals damage to all units standing directly in 
front of him. Howl of Rage is basically Warcry as it lowers the Speed of 
surrounding units. Watch out for his heavy Weapon Attack. A strike from that
will send most units into critical HP. 
      
The Battle Queen herself is no laughing matter. She currently holds the 
highest Weapon Attack out of both her Dephs heathens. However, she is 
currently incapable of using any abililities. Therefore, if you can just 
avoid her bite, then you should be fine. Defeat the two Totema clones and 
then focus on Remedi. Don't allow her to touch you however, as a hit from her 
would take most units down. Defeat Remedi and complete the battle... 

Is it over...?

          Difficulty: Very Hard
          Enemies:  
                   Deph x2 (Mateus)
                   Li-grim (Remedi)

Queen Remedi has been defeated... or not. Mewt appears once again and Marche 
takes this chance in a vain attempt to talk to him. Mewt's beginning to break 
down finally. While Remedi is weakened, Marche does his best and tries to coax 
with him. The Queen gets up again and walks over to Mewt. "I am the wish-
gatherer. I am the world-maker." No longer is she Queen Remedi. Now she is the 
pure essence that binds this world together. Defeat her... and the wishes
shall be undone... With that, the Li-Grim brings in two more Dephs. This time, 
they are Mateus, the Human Totema. The epic battle we had all been waiting 
for shall begin in the next few seconds. This really is the end.

Bring in five units and let the final battle begin. Before we go over Li-Grim, 
you might want to know what the two Dephs Remedi has summoned are capable of. 
The last Totema battle was difficult. Now, you are up against two Mateuses. 
Spellbind deals Dark damage and can Slow a target. Breath of God is a new and 
improved version of Famfrit's original signature move. Along with that, both 
Mateuses have mastered Star Cross which deals Holy damage to all enemy units
and Thundaga, the Black Magic spell.

Li-Grim herself is a difficulty. Lucky for you, her Weapon Attack has gone 
down. What appeared however were a bunch of abilities; all of them being 
dangerous in their own sense. Lawshift is one annoying ability that is also 
very unpredictable. Basically, she is capable of shifting the Laws to her 
liking, and Cid has no control over it. Amber Gleam acts by Dispeling status 
enhancements. Her offensive magic (Ricca) consists of Llednar's Omega which 
deals heavy damage. However, Alpha dwarves even Omega in terms of damage! 
Descent sends in a random Totema and Magi deals lot of damage really, really 
fast. 

If you really want to win as quickly as possible, send all your units on a 
collision course against Remedi. The Mateuses are dangerous, but attacking 
them will only allow Remedi more time to use Omega or Alpha. From here on, 
there's really no more strategy. The remaining battle depends on your 
determination and your sheer power. Overwhelm Remedi... and the world-
thread... shall disappear...

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]

The battle is over... Remedi has been banished... and the world will change
back. Unsurprisingly, the game has been completed. Enjoy the ending. A great 
congratulations to you on defeating the game!

| |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 5. Missions ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[5000]~| |
|_|=========================================================================|_|

Missions play an integral part of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. A number of 
them are required to get through the game of course, but that only accounts 
for about 1/12 the total amount of the whoppin' 300 missions to play through.
So if you want to complete the game 100%, I'd suggest you follow this section.

Keep in mind that the earlier missions will eventually disappear to be 
replaced by the larger end missions. I have had this happen very often, so 
take a word of advice, complete every mission that you possibly can. If you 
decide to hold off on even one mission, it might scar your game forever. I'm
not talking about the missions which you don't have Mission Items for, just 
the ones that you CAN do but decide NOT to. 

There are four different types of missions. The icons all represent the four.
A sword represents an Engagement. A scroll of paper represents a Dispatch. A
clan helmet represents an Encounter. And finally, a white flag represents a 
Capture. 

     * NOTE: There is a possibility that the Gil cost for each mission will
       differ from Pub to Pub or depending on how late in the game you are.
       The prices you see are the prices which you will pay as soon as a 
       mission appears.

                      Red Cap 
                      Sprite 

          This mission is impossible to avoid. At the beginning of the game,
          it will be the only mission on the board. Luckily, it isn't hard...

          Enter the Giza Plains area and Marche and Montblanc will walk in.
          Immediately, Marche will notice some monsters and note that they
          will have to clear them out. You are allowed four more clan members
          (or everyone in your clan obviously) to join the battle. This isn't
          difficult at all so you can take your time. The Goblins aren't very
          powerful but the Red Cap can cause some problems. I'd suggest 
          bombarding it with Black Magic from Montblanc. The Sprite should 
          probably be left for last as it doesn't use any abilities and its 
          Fight move does miniscule damage. Once you defeat all enemies, you
          will have won your first battle. 

     #2 Thesis Hunt ~

                      Thief x2  
                      White Mage  

          This battle is really a major step up from the previous "Monster
          Mash" that we just had. Instead of the weakling Goblins, now we are
          up against a group of pickpockets who have a few tricks up their 
          sleeves.

          The two units at the top of the arena are a White Mage and a lvl. 4
          Thief. Those two (obviously) cannot be attacked towards the first 
          few rounds because of their position but you should attempt to 
          prioritize them the best you can. The stronger, lvl. 4 Thief 
          Reaction ability, Counter that should be something new to you. To 
          avoid that ability, use ranged attacks like Montblanc's Black Magic
          or your Archer. The Soldiers use Mug often, but other than that, 
          they just attack with sword slashes. While their swords can do some 
          damage, don't waste time on them until the end of the battle. Defeat
          the Archer quickly before it can use any of his annoying, Aim: Arm
          or Aim: Legs crap. When everyone is taken down, the mission is yours
          and Dalilei's thesis is back into safekeeping.

                      Archer 
                      Black Mage 

          Marche will step into the Nubswood area and whom else does he find 
          other than his old friend, Ritz!... Along with a Viera who calls 
          herself Shara. Also on the playing field is the clan which calls 
          themselves the "Cheetahs." And after a bit of a reunion, the battle
          begins with you being allied with Ritz and Shara. With that, this 
          engagement is that much easier. 

          I wouldn't suggest a White Mage for this battle, while you can still
          bring one in if you are unsure of your clan, there's a very little
          chance that any of your units will actually get KOed as long as you 
          know what you're doing. You can only bring in three other clanners
          so the free space can be useful. You should take out the White Mage
          first obviously. Then, go for the Archer which can immobilize and 
          disable your units. I know you might want to prioritize the Thief 
          and Fighter, but during this battle, they aren't really any threat.
          Your second priority should be the White Monk, and the rest is your
          choice. It's a very easy battle so take your time.

                      Antlion 
                      Coeurl 

          Marche and Montblanc will walk into the area when the two are 
          greeted by a group of monsters. Well, nothing else to do but engage
          them. 

          This is a tough battle considering how early in the game it is. You
          probably don't have any better jobs other than the regular Archer,
          Soldier, etc. The toughest monsters here are the Panther class. 
          Those are the two Red Panthers and the Coeurl which is a stronger,
          blue version of the Red Panther. All three have incredible attack
          power and their defense are really high. If your Archer has learned
          Aim: Arm, target the Coeurl to disable it for a while. The Cream is 
          a strange creature which is barely affected by physical attack. 
          However, use Fire (As it is weak against fire elemental) from one 
          of your Black Mages to kill it in one shot or critically damage it.
          With the three Panthers out of the way, this battle will go much 
          quicker.

                      Floateye x2
                      Ahriman x2

          Marche will slowly walk into the Ulei River area. After looking 
          around a tiny bit, he concludes that nothing seems to be wrong.
          However, a strange black warp will appear in the center of the 
          screen. Immediately, Marche is on his guard, but his cautiousness
          isn't enough to avoid the warp itself which sends Marche to a strange
          temple-like area...
 
          At first, Marche will be confused. However, he looks ahead and
          notices something... A crystal! But before he can do anything, a 
          strange voice booms through the air demanding Marche's name. Uttering
          a nervous whisper, Marche returns the question. A strange creature
          warps out of the crystal and explains to you that his name is 
          Famfrit, the Totema of the first crystal. Though he looks friendly,
          he isn't about to let some insecure human get to the crystal which
          he was charged with defending. Calling upon two Floateyes and two 
          Ahrimans, he wishes to engage.

          The objective here is to defeat the boss. In this case, it's the 
          Moogle Totema, Famfrit. If your units are leveled up well enough, 
          this battle will go much quicker. The best thing you can do would
          be to put Famfrit to sleep and deal with the other monsters first
          even though your objective is to take out Famfrit. While Famfrit is
          asleep, you will want Marche or your main attacker to get up to him
          and give him a nice slash or smack to wake him and get a free hit. 
          Note that one of the Ahriman's knows the ability, Roulette. It gets
          in a corner and randomly KOs a random unit, on your team or even
          on his own team. Diligently cut away at Famfrit's health and you 
          should defeat this Totema. 

     #6 Antilaws ~

          It seems that shady Nu Mou fellow we met before in Cadoan is now in
          trouble. Marche isn't too smart here. Oh yes, let's help some random
          Nu Mou stranger that we only met through chance. Anyhow, Marche,
          being the ethical fellow he is, decides to help the troubled Nu Mou,
          whether he's a murderer or simply a innocent bystander. Let's find
          out.
  
          The battle consists of your clan versus six other enemies. Ezel the
          Hermetic (Yes, you learn that the Nu Mou fellow is the great Ezel 
          Berbier) will help you out but he won't actually attack. His ability,
          Azoth, can put all the enemies to sleep. However, since you can't
          control him, it's hard to tell if Ezel will use it or not. Anyhow,
          the Illusionist is probably a new unit you haven't yet seen before. 
          Illusionists use Phantasm to throw a spell and damage the entire
          field without having to manually hit something.
 
          This battle is tough, yes, but if you know who to prioritize, you 
          should be fine. If your clan has low Magic Resistance, the 
          Illusionist should be your main target. If your clan has low Defense,
          the Fighter and Defender should be taken out immediately. The Hunter
          and Ninja on the upper rear end of the playing field should be 
          attacked last. Constantly attack and you should be fine. Be sure that
          Ezel stays alive however!

                      Ice Flan
                      Icedrake
 
          Take a look at the enemies list for this mission. Yep, all of them
          are monsters, and all of them have incredibly valuable abilities for
          a Blue Mage, or your Morpher. Therefore, you might want to bring in
          a Beastmaster (Along with a Blue Mage) or a Hunter. However, be aware
          that this monster battle is no pushover, so make sure you also bring
          in your best units too.

          The enemies are all generic, except for the Ice Flan. As you might
          already know, the Flan group of monsters only are affected by magical
          spells. The most effective one would be the Fire elemental, which 
          one of your Black Mage's should already have. The two Icedrakes 
          differ in abilities. One has the Dragoon tech, Ice Breath, and the
          other holds Mighty Guard. Both Icedrakes have high attack power, so
          beware. 

          To start off, you should attack the Lamia, and the Ice Flan with a 
          nice ranged Fire elemental attack. Following up, take out the first 
          Icedrake. The Bomb can be left for last, as it doesn't hold any 
          redeeming qualities. Once you get the Ice Flan and the Icedrakes out
          of the way, the battle will become another generic monster fight.
          Easy enough.

          Difficulty: Medium
          Enemies:    Ultima Crystal x8

          Marche steps into the Roda Volcano area and starts nagging about the
          heat. Suddenly, a violent earthquake occurs, and a strange black warp
          appears in the middle. The first thing Marche notices is that there
          must be a crystal here! The warp blows off, and swallows you into the
          abyss...

          As the screen fades back in, you should note the difference in the
          colors. Instead of the gray, dark area that held the last crystal,
          this one is colorful, and lively. Butterflies even litter the area. 
          Marche notes as well the butterflies, and how different this area is
          from the last. Luckily, there doesn't seem to be any Totema guarding
          this crystal, so Marche walks up to it... Suddenly, a number of 
          Ultima Crystals fade in. Looks like it isn't going to be as easy as
          we expected. 

          These strange Ultima Crystals are actually the Totema itself. They
          are very different from the previous Totema, Famfrit because they are
          incapable of moving. In fact, they are pretty much inanimate objects
          made to guard this second crystal. Wait a second, if they can't move,
          you can use that to your advantage! These Ultima Crystal's only 
          other attack is Logos, an annoying move which not only Charms you,
          but lowers your Attack and Defense. 

          There is a very easy way to knock these things out. If you use this
          strategy, the battle becomes that much easier. The idea is to get up
          right next to the Ultima Crystals, while out of the range of the
          others. The Ultima Crystal you are standing next to won't use Logos
          unless you are at least one tile away. Therefore, it will be forced
          to use its Fight move, which does weak damage. If at every turn, you
          use this strategy, you should be able to get out of this battle with
          all your units intact. Be sure you only send one unit to each Ultima 
          Crystal as if you have two against one, it will use Logos. 

          Be sure that when you try to take out one Ultima Crystal, you aren't
          in the range of another. The first one you destroy will be the 
          hardest as there aren't too many areas safe from the Logos of the
          other ones. Just don't group your units together and you should be
          fine. The Ultima Crystals are annoying, but they do have that one
          weakness. Take advantage of it, and you should win this battle with
          incredible ease.

                      Thief x2
                      Summoner 

          Deep in the Koringwood, a group of illegal lumberjacks are cutting
          down some magic wood to sell for a lot of Gil elsewhere. Luckily, 
          Marche walks in within the nick of time to quickly stop them. Time
          to engage. 
          
          This time, you are engaging against seven other members, with each
          being pretty strong in his or her own sense. You are allowed five
          members including Marche, so the odds are against you this time. 
          However, if you eliminate the biggest threats firsthand, the battle
          will become much easier. Nevertheless, it is never a bad idea to
          invest a spot for a White Mage. 
          
          The first enemies to move will probably be the two Thieves. They 
          aren't the most dangerous, so if you don't have to attack them, just
          ignore them for the time being. If you are really paranoid about 
          them stealing something, you can always Blind them. The Sniper is
          fairly dangerous, but doesn't hold too many abilities. Now, the 
          Archer however, should be defeated as soon as possible to avoid her
          abilities. 

          The remaining units are all magic casters, so they can easily be
          disabled if you can possibly cast some sort of Silence on them. 
          Since Templar's are good at this kind of stuff, try to have one with
          you. Once the Time Mage, Summoner, and Black Mage are Silenced, they
          are completely helpless. I'd suggest keeping these three Silenced,
          while you focus on the others. Leave the magic casters for last.

          The main problem here is numbers. However, even though the opponent
          outnumbers you about 5 to 7, you can improvise. Instead of going
          gun-ho at every enemy unit, use status ailmenting attacks to maybe
          keep them at bay for a few turns. Use an Archer or Gunner to Blind
          your enemies, and the battle is automatically yours. If you can use
          abilities to your advantage, this battle flows much quicker.

                      Templar x2
                      Runeseeker (Babus

          Trotting slowly into the Salika Keep area, Marche begins his search
          for this "giant emerald crystal." As he rounds the steps, he begins 
          to wonder if this is one of those "crystals." An unknown voice will
          call to you ahead. The screen shifts and you will realize that Babus
          is here as well on Mewt's personal orders. Babus will ask of Marche,
          someone who means the Prince ill. 

          Marche however, knows who that person is. In an attempt to get his
          way out of any accusations, Marche immediately tells him not. But
          his conscience blabbers out his words, speaking that he didn't know
          this was Mewt's world. With that, Babus realizes all too well. His
          group prepares for attack, and you should do the same. 
 
          With the addition to Marche, the game allows you to bring in five
          more units for battle. The next rounds of battle will be quite 
          difficult, so make sure that the units you send in are powerful 
          enough to take out Babus along with the rest of his group. (If it is
          required.) Start the battle, and begin.

          Babus the Runeseeker can provide a bunch of problems. His job is
          unique as you might already have noticed. His abilities are made up
          of the R-Ability, Counter and some other abilities. Explode is a 
          heavy damage spell similar to the Sage's Giga Flare; Stillness 
          inflicts Stop status; and Quarter is the same as the Time Mage's 
          ability which takes out 1/4 of a particular unit's health.

          Along with Babus, which will probably cause you the majority of 
          your problems here, you have two Templars, a Gunner, a Bishop, and 
          an Alchemist. Next to Babus in amount of difficulty would be both of
          the "Temple Knights." One is armed with Rasp, a MP damaging attack, 
          Cheer which raises Attack statistics, Haste which is self-
          explanatory, and the R-Ability, Bonecrusher. The other holds Astra
          which automatically nullifies status ailments, Warcry which lowers
          Speed, Cheer again; which raises Attack, and the S-Ability, Weapon
          Atk+. 

          The Bishop is a rather flexible unit capable of dealing damage, 
          curing his own allies, and casting Dispel to get rid of all status
          enhancements. How much you prioritize him is going to be your call,
          but remember that as soon as soon as the Bishop is out, your enemy
          will not be capable of healing without the help of items. The other
          magic caster, an Alchemist, is much more offensive. You will want to
          especially watch out for Flare or Frog.
 
          Lastly, you will find a Moogle Gunner towards the rear. For the most
          part, his abilities are simple, but Stopshot can become annoying, 
          especially with Concentrate as a S-Ability. You might find that 
          taking out the Gunner will help an amazing amount. Avoid Stopshot
          or just Blind him to nullify Concentrate for hopefully, the future
          majority of the battle.

          The objective here is to defeat Babus and none other. Therefore, 
          unless of course you are looking to some experience, I'd suggest you
          put all your emphasis on him. Then again, if you are sure you can't
          win this battle without first taking out the other units, by all 
          means, treat this battle as a clan war.

                      Thundrake
                      Totema (Adrammelech)

          For this next story mission, Marche enters the Nargai Cave in search
          of this supposed "ghost." A small orb appears in front of Marche, 
          and his reaction is a bit puzzling. "Funny, here I am looking at a 
          ghost. But I don't feel scared at all." As strange as enigmas can 
          become, the ghost begins to move, and Marche follows. With his 
          guard off, the warp catches Marche...

          As the screen fades back in, you find yourself in yet another temple
          holding probably, another crystal. The ghost has disappeared, but 
          suddenly reappears. The crystal is up ahead, and the Totema makes 
          his way out. Absorbing the ghost, the Totema begins to speak of no
          one but his masters may approach. Confident, Marche prepares himself
          for a battle. Adrammalech prepares himself too, and brings in his
          Dragon fiends. 

          This battle is a major step up from the two other "pushover" Totemas
          you have fought in the past. If you had thought they were hard, 
          prepare to be obliterated. Bring in five more units (A White Mage or
          similar would be smart), and begin the battle. Because the enemy
          Dragons don't have terribly high Speed, you should be able to move
          first. 

          Luckily, the Dragons here aren't anything you haven't seen already.
          The only one which might remotely be a new appearance might be the
          Thundrake. All three of them have elemental Breath attacks for their
          respectable type (i.e. Firewyrm holds Fire Breath; Icedrake holds
          Ice Breath; Thundrake holds Bolt Breath). This is basically the only
          A-Abilities those Dragons hold with exception to the Icewyrm who can
          also cast Mighty Guard on his allies. Geomancy ups Magic Power, and
          Weapon Atk+ ups Weapon Attack obviously.

          While the Dragons aren't too tough apart from their Attack power,
          the Totema himself holds some pretty powerful abilities. Not only is
          he the coolest looking Totema, hands down, but his Firestream attack
          can become devastating. Remember Famfrit's Breath of God? Multiply
          the damage by two, and give it some Fire elemental bonus damage to
          create an A-Ability to be reckoned with. Lightspeed is a quick attack
          nullifying R-Ability, and Howl of Rage lowers surrounding units 
          Speed. Finally, Soul Sphere hurts your MP so keep your mages safe.

          The best thing to do would definitely be to inflict a few binding
          status ailments on the initial Dragons. Disable, Immobilize, and
          Blind all work wonders to keep them off your back. You shouldn't
          need to be bothered by the Dragons, as all of your forces should be
          plopped atop Adrammelech. There really isn't too much to explain 
          here, as all you need is a powerful physical strike to take out 
          this Bangaa Totema as quickly as possible.

          Well, here we are; Jagd Dorsa. You should know already that if 
          anyone gets KOed here and you leave them on the ground, they are 
          dead. With that in mind, prepare yourself for a rather difficult
          fight against Nono's enemy bandits.

          Because of the Jagd threat here, you might want to bring in a 
          White Mage to revive in case your units happen to fall. Phoenix
          Downs work well too. Make sure that the units you send in have high 
          Defense. Paladins or Defenders are perfect fitting for this 
          description. You will not want to be killed here, especially against
          this hardcore group...
  
          Your enemies consist of mostly clan units, but a few monsters as 
          well. Right in front of you at the start are a Ninja who holds
          Metal Veil, Water Veil, and Double Sword which is allows him to hold
          two swords in two hands for a double hit; a Blue Mage with Dragon 
          technique, Mighty Guard, Lamia technique, Night, Coeurl technique,
          Hastebreak, and the Sprite's healing technique of White Wind. Along
          with that, the Hunter boasts a solid Attack statistics and holds
          Sonic Boom, Advice, and Aim: Vitals which inflicts a random status
          ailment on you.

          An Assassin appears to your left. She can become especially deadly
          with her specialty A-Abilities. Shadowbind Stops a target in its 
          tracks by pinning shadow to the ground, Last Breath is an automatic
          KO (Not good for a Jagd. Oh boy.), Aphonia is the standard Silence,
          and Oblivion Addles the target disallowing them to use any A-
          Abilities. Don't try any arrows at this mean chick unless you want
          them returned at you. 

          The Antlion and Toughskin aren't too much of threats, but should 
          still be fought with caution. LV3 Def-less lowers Weapon Defense
          and Magic Resistance to all units with levels divisible by three.
          Sandstorm is the standard whirlwind attack which Blinds targets.
          The Rockbeast doesn't have any new techniques. Still holding the
          original Resonate and Matra Magic, you shouldn't have any trouble
          with it.

          You should try to kill off the Assassin and Ninja right off the
          bat. The Assassin has terribly effective A-Abilities, and the Ninja
          can unleash his hurt with Double Sword. Watch out for Last Breath
          especially, as it automatically KOs, and if that unit isn't revived,
          it's basically lights out for that member. The Hunter should be
          prioritized if you want to avoid random status ailments, and the
          Blue Mage should also be taken out quickly. This battle is tough,
          so don't fret if you mess up a few times. After all, this is your
          first Jagd battle. 

     #13 The Bounty ~

                      Time Mage
                      Black Mage

          You should know the drill by now. Find the unknown wanderer on the
          world map. As soon as you enter the battlefield, you will appear 
          before Clan Ox. There's no hostility at first, but one of the grunts
          notes that this Marche fellow looks incredibly alike to that bounty.
          But guess what! It's you they are looking for!

          Of all the possibilities, you just had to accept this mission to
          actually help Clan Ox find you. Heh, since we aren't about to let
          ourselves be turned in, we'll fight our way out. Hopefully, you had
          brought in a healing unit as this clan isn't your ordinary pushover.
          Ranged attackers work well too. 

          Your enemies consist of a Sage, a Paladin, a Fighter, a Red Mage,
          a Time Mage, and a Black Mage... phew. From past experience, you
          might expect the Paladin to be the main figure of difficulty here.
          Although his Attack power is fairly high, he lacks in abilities with
          only Saint Cross and Drop Weapon. He is also capable of healing, but
          barely ever uses that ability.
 
          In terms of physical damage, the Fighter might pose a threat. A few
          standard Fighter abilities as well as a high Weapon Attack, you 
          can't go wrong tackling him out first. In terms of actual damage,
          the Black Mage easily cuts that mark. His Magic Power lies in the
          200s, and his abilities consist of some standard techniques. Much 
          of the time, one of them will be an "-aga" ability. If you are
          unfamiliar with that suffix, just know it is the most powerful of
          the elemental spells a Black Mage can throw at you.

          Sages normally pose problems, but not this one. Just be thankful
          this one doesn't hold Giga Flare. Reflex negates all Fight moves
          as you might already know, so be sure you actually have some other
          abilities which can damage the Sage. The Red Mage is laughable
          considering the fact that she doesn't hold Doublecast, and her Magic
          Power is second-rate. Finally, the Time Mage can pose some threats.
          You do not want him to cast Quicken on the Fighter right after he
          damaged your units already. Quick KOs for the enemy.

          You will want to Disable the Fighter and Paladin quickly. Following,
          you can choose to Silence everyone else. It would be smart to bring
          in a utility unit to do all those status ailments, followed by your
          physical and magical attackers, followed by a healing unit. If you
          can set up an attack, you should be fine. However, if you just rush
          in without any strategy, you probably won't last that long. This 
          isn't a difficult battle considering it is a story battle, so you
          should be fine.

          Enemies:    Juggler
                      Alchemist
                      Time Mage
                      Gadgeteer 

          Marche enters the area as he always does and notices Shara coming
          out from a corner. Ritz also appears right behind you, and the two
          of you greet. Marche asks Ritz if she know of the bounty on Marche's
          head; Ritz responds and tells Marche she would never turn him in. 
          They are here instead, for some other business... 

          Ritz runs up and calls the Golden Clock forgers out. Yep, you 
          guessed it, it's another battle alongside Ritz. Judging from past 
          experience, this battle should be fairly easy considering that you 
          have Ritz and Shara on your side, not to mention that you are up 
          against only four competitors. Bring in three extra units and start 
          the battle. 

          Your enemies consist of an Alchemist, a Juggler, a Time Mage, and
          a Gadgeteer. The Alchemist holds Meteor which rains a large rock
          on your units for heavy damage, Poison which... well... Poisons of
          course, and Toad which turns the target into a Frog. Whee...!
          Alongside, you see a Juggler with Hurl which throws an item, 
          Firebomb which damages and Berserks, and Ball which Confuses.

          The Time Mage can become dangerous if you aren't careful. Demi is
          extremely effective against those with high HP, and Quicken gives a
          free turn to the unit of choice. Also, Slow and Stop are two 
          annoying status ailments you will want to avoid at all costs unless
          you like to lose turns.

          Finally, the Gadgeteer is as unpredictable as it is effective. 
          Red Spring casts Haste on a random side at the flip of a coin (Just
          hope that's you), Blue Screw casts Dispel on a random side at 
          another flip of a coin (Just hope that isn't you), and Green Gear
          Poisons either side (Again, just hope that isn't you). Also, 
          Damage > MP will make striking this Gadgeteer down a trifle 
          difficult. 

          Without Ritz or Shara, this battle might have caused some problems.
          But because both of your allies are at such high levels with 
          effective abilities, you should barely even break a sweat. However,
          just remember that Ritz and Shara can be KOed, and that's when you
          better do something, or face defeat. You can be a bit laid back here,
          but don't let your guard down.

                      Templar x2
                      Mog Knight x2

          As you enter Muscadet, an engagement is about to occur. Marche and
          Montblanc appear in the area and witness some Judges and officers of
          the law bringing in random units for questioning. A particular 
          argument between a Moogle and a Judge will appear on-screen. The
          Moogle will ask why he is to be brought in, and Judge responds with
          that the human they are looking for has been seen with a Moogle.
          Unable to take this injustice, Marche runs in...

          The first thing he does is exclaim that he is the one Prince Mewt
          is looking for. While the Judge is a bit disbelieving, he still
          brings in units to capture this supposed boy. Units begin to move
          in, and you will note that you are a bit outnumbered. Bring in three
          extra units with addition to Marche and Montblanc and begin the 
          battle with the odds of 5 vs. 7 stacked against you.

          Your enemies consist of some powerful units, but the most dangerous
          of them all would be the Paladin or the two Templars. If you care
          to steal anything, you will definitely want the Dragon Mail or 
          Genji Armor. The first enemy unit to move will probably be the enemy
          Paladin or either Mog Knight, but if you brought in swift units, 
          you should be able to move first for the most part. 

          The two Templars are dangerous with both of them holding the 
          R-Ability, Bonecrusher. In addition, both Templars can terrorize 
          you with Astra, Warcry, Rasp, Haste, and Lifebreak which can deal 
          incredible damage when you knock off a lot of that Templar's HP. 
          The second most dangerous, the Paladin lacks in numbers of abilities,
          but don't let that get your guard off. Holy Blade does incredible
          damage, and Drop Weapon can become annoying.

          Also included are two Mog Knights, a Gunner, and a Sage. The Mog
          Knights are pretty much standard issue and shouldn't provide much
          problems with only Mog Attack, Mog Guard, Mog Rush, Mog Lance, Mog
          Shield, and Mog Aid. By now, you should already have many ways to
          counter-act these kind of abilities. The Sage is almost laughable
          with only Drain, Aero, and Bio. Finally, the Gunner isn't dangerous
          as it hasn't learned Concentrate.

          At the beginning, begin Disabling and/or Immobilizing the Templar
          and Bishop immediately. Using status ailments can easily turn the
          tide of battle with you. Following, you will want to Blind the 
          Gunner. Deal with the opponents as you see fit, but you should try
          to set up an attack which you know won't fail before you attempt
          something rash. 

          But the battle isn't over just yet...

          Difficulty: Hard
          Enemies:    Avatar x8 (Exodus Fruit)
                      Runeseeker (Babus) 

          Afterwards, Judgemaster Cid appears on the scene, and begins to 
          question you. Pretty sure that the boy is the boy, Cid brings him
          to the prison. There, Babus will run in and confirm that the boy is
          indeed Marche. Now that they know, Marche demands that Judgemaster
          Cid let the others go. Cid will ask Marche if he is the one 
          destroying the crystals. Marche confirms, and a seam appears 
          mysteriously. Somehow...

          The fourth crystal is weak... But you have no access to your clan
          as of now. Babus and Cid are also in the area, and they aren't about
          to let you destroy these crystals in which they had so willingly
          defended. You guessed it, it's another fight with Runeseeker Babus,
          and this time, he's even tougher. The only opposition you will 
          receive here is from Babus. The Totema is weak, and it can't attack. 
          Since Cid is a Judgemaster (obviously), he will play as Judge to 
          make sure the Laws are enforced. Babus is no laughing matter 
          however. This battle is a one vs. one... Babus vs. Marche.

          Babus's abilities consist of Explode, a deadly Fire elemental move,
          Stillness, which Stops Marche right in his tracks, and Demi which
          cuts off half of your HP right off the bat. In addition, Counter
          and Weapon Def+ makes him even more of an adversary. The key here
          is to avoid his first move, and follow-up with a heavy damage move
          which you should have at this point for a physical character as
          Marche. Holy Blade or Beatdown would work. However, if you don't
          have access to them, you might have to pick away at Babus's health
          continuously and use X-Potions constantly. Defeat Babus and the
          Fruits to win.

                      Bishop x2
                      Fighter x2

          You all know how I start these story battle things right? "As Marche
          enters the area, he will note... blah blah blah blah." Well, for this
          battle, Marche won't enter the area at first. Therefore, you won't
          hear me say that. Instead, the camera brings you to the battlefield
          and a small conversation between our would be competitors. The 
          Fighters hints something about a kid and late. Perhaps an ambush?
          A scout Thief walks in and states that their "pot of gold" is here
          now. 
          
          Guess who walks in? Why, if it wouldn't be yours truly, Marche. 
          Seeing as he's just been ambushed by a group of six enemies, Marche
          doesn't appear too surprised. Just a simple, "Huh?" Anyhow, prepare
          for another battle. Bring in five extra well-rounded units and 
          prepare yourself for battle once again. You know the drill by now,
          don't you?
 
          Look at your enemies and you will notice that their line-up is
          pretty simple with two Fighters, two Thieves, and two Bishops. 
          Provide that you actually care to know what abilities to avoid, I'll
          tell you that you really want to watch out for Strikeback. Don't
          make stupid moves when you are already sure that it will miss, and
          you will probably get a nice thwack in the head for your imbecile
          move. The same goes for Bonecrusher, but there are a few ways around
          it. 

          The opponent's Fighter abilities consist of Rush, Air Render, Far 
          Fist, Wild Swing, Beatdown, and Blitz. If you were wondering if 
          both Fighters hold all those abilities, the answer is luckily, no.
          They are split up between them. Therefore, if you take out Fighter 
          #1 who has Wild Swing, Far Fist, and Beatdown, you won't have to
          worry about those moves for the rest of the mission unless Fighter 
          #1 happens to revive magically.

          The Thieves can provide some problems. Both of them hold Steal: 
          Weapon, which obviously, steals your weapon. You might want to watch
          out especially. Even worse, Steal: Ability literally "steals" one
          of your abilities. Therefore, you might find it smart to Disable or
          Immobilize the Thieves from afar. Apart from that, you won't see
          too much damage nor annoyance from them. Just don't let your rare
          weapons get stolen. 
 
          The remaining opposition consists of two Bishops. Lucky for you,
          they aren't the most powerful magic casters you might find. Water 
          and Aero do mediocre damage, and Holy might be the largest damage
          dealer even though it doesn't do THAT high of damage either way.
          Also, Bishops are capable of using Cura in this mission and Judge
          steals your JP. 

          Concern yourself with the Thieves at first. Once the chances of
          getting weapons stolen is at 0% (In short, just KO both Thieves),
          you can focus on the Fighters which are probably attacking your
          units like mad at that point. The Bishops won't provide too much
          problem, so you might want to leave them for last unless you have
          a masterful plan of your own. Defeat all enemies and win the 
          mission.

          As you enter Gotor Sands for the Desert Patrol mission, Marche
          notices a certain person... that looks a bit familiar. Walking a 
          bit closer, he realizes that it's Doned. Marche is instantly 
          happy to see his brother, but Doned remains silent, and runs away.
          Marche follows and to his surprise, sees Doned talking with another
          group. But even as dumbfounded as he might be, Marche realized 
          that his brother had just turned him in for a bounty. Just what
          is going on?

          The palace still wants your head, and as obvious, this enemy clan
          has come to challenge you. They were notified of your whereabouts 
          by a certain someone. There's nothing else to do but to fight our
          way out of this trap. Bring in six units to go against this enemy
          group and start the battle. Your foe this time is made up of Bangaa 
          and Humans. You will probably notice, that with exception to the 
          Bishop, your enemies are all physical. Try to bring in some magic
          casting units that have moderate Weapon Defense like Morphers or
          Sages to counteract their Weapon Attacks, and work upon their 
          weaker Magic Resistance.

          The White Monk in the front has a bunch of techniques up his 
          alley. Whirlwind damages surrounding units, Air Render is a ranged
          attack, Earth Render deals damage to ALL units in front of him,
          and Far Fist deals ranged splash-damage. Luckily, his Weapon Attack
          is fairly low so don't expect too much from a simple Fight move.
          Behind him is a Gladiator holding the elemental "Spellblade" 
          techniques which include Fire Sword, Bolt Sword, and Ice Sword. 
          They should be pretty self-explanatory.
  
          Two Soldiers make up the Humans of this enemy group. The one closer
          to you at the start holds a few standard "Break" attacks including
          Powerbreak, Mindbreak, and Magicbreak. Provoke Berserks your units
          so be careful. The other Soldier is less of a threat. Luckily, he
          only can use Powerbreak, Mindbreak, and Speedbreak. Mug deals 
          damage but steals Gil at the same time. However, that shouldn't be
          too much of a problem to you.
 
          Right smack-dab in the center is the Defender. Although his Weapon
          Attack and Defense can be intimidating, his abilities are nothing
          to be afraid of. Tremor pushes back all surrounding units, Drop
          Weapon drops your units' weapons, and Mow Down damages all 
          surrounding units, but causes the Defender to lose all his Evade 
          for the entire next turn. The Dragoon has even higher Weapon Attack
          and his abilities can become particularly exasperating. Lancet 
          drains HP, Fire and Bolt Breath are obvious. 

          The magic-casting unit of this battle is the Bishop in the front.
          Luckily, he doesn't pose much of a threat compared to the other
          units. Water is really the only damaging spell he holds. Dispel 
          clears all status enhancements and Break inflicts Petrify on your
          units. Keep in careful mind that once the Bishop is defeated, your
          opponent will have no means of healing apart from having to use
          items.

          I always prefer to take out the magic-caster, seeing as once he's
          down and out, the battle will move much quicker. Therefore, your
          opponent must rely on physical strength to overcome you. Since for
          the most part, Weapon Defense is higher than Magic Resistance for
          this enemy group, magic spells work wonders. Watch out for the
          Bishop's Return Magic however. As you progress through the battle,
          it will become easier and easier until you win.

                      Biskmatar (Llednar)

          The Delia Dunes have stopped barking. Enter the area and Marche will
          complain about the lack of sound. As he is about to walk out however,
          a certain Llednar happens to waltz in. Marche has never seen this
          monster before so he is a bit confused. With a simple, yet powerful
          order, Llednar tells Marche to get out of here. Just before Llednar
          pushes him out, a seam opens...

          Yes, here it is. The fifth and final crystal is just up ahead. The
          Llednar dude is nowhere in sight however. Quietly, Marche disregards
          him and continues. Just up ahead, to Marche's great dismay, is the
          strange man again. With another order, Llednar orders you to go no
          further. With a final blow, Llednar attempts to put Marche in his 
          place...

          Suddenly, a commanding voice streaks through the air. Judgemaster
          Cid has just appeared in the nick of time to stop Llednar and his
          deadly intentions. With an antilaw, the Judgemaster places a law on
          Llednar's most powerful attack, Omega. Disabled, Llednar continues
          to fight, and Marche chooses to stay. Prepare yourself... against
          Biskmatar Llednar. 

          While Llednar summons two Templars and two Titanias, you should 
          send in five units of your own. The Templars are both formidable 
          opponents. With heavy Weapon Attack, they can easily chop through
          your units like a butter knife through butter. If you bring in 
          any Mages, watch out for Silence, and their MP damaging attacks,
          Soul Sphere and Rasp. Astra is a special status enhancement that 
          automatically nullifies the first status ailment against that unit.
          Lifebreak deals lost HP in damage, and Warcry lowers Speed of all
          surrounding units.

          The two Titanias aren't as dangerous in terms of Weapon Attack, but
          LV?D Holy will still pose problems. If the day of month matches your
          unit's level, prepare for some heavy Holy damage against you. Angel
          Whisper both heals HP and casts Auto-Life on one of their allies.
          The last of the units, Llednar himself, is no pushover. He holds 
          incredible Weapon Attack. Even without Omega, he is a major problem.
       
          First off, his lineup of abilities is very deadly. Abyss acts like
          a Sage's Bio, damaging and Poisoning at the same time. Life Render
          deals damage and Dooms Llednar's targets. Heart Render deals MP
          damage. Ripcircle acts by damaging all surrounding units. And 
          finally, Furycircle deals damage to all surrounding units as well 
          as knocking them back. However, if you attempt to damage Llednar,
          you will find that no matter what you use, Llednar cannot be killed.
          
          Therefore, it is impossible to defeat the boss. Luckily, there is a 
          way to win out. Wait out the battle by defeating Llednar's allies,
          and Cid will eventually banish Llednar with a Red Card. With that
          freak gone, Marche may continue. To his great dismay however, the 
          Totema itself still awaits. 

          Difficulty: Hard
          Enemies:    Vampire x4
                      Totema (Mateus)

          With Llednar defeated for the time being, the final crystal awaits.
          As a precaution, Judgemaster Cid asks if Marche would like to leave.
          Knowing his destiny, Marche rightfully declines. Leading him into
          the final room, Cid states that the final crystal is here. The 
          Totema appears as expected, the Totema of the Humans. Mateus will
          suddenly turn into Ritz, then Doned, then Mewt, and then Marche
          himself. Knowing that this is just a mind-trick, Marche disregards 
          it. The fight will begin.

          The four figures will turn into four Vampires. Mateus herself 
          appears in the center. Seeing as this is the toughest of the
          Totemas, take necessary precautions with the units you choose to 
          send in. I would strongly suggest a White Mage against the Vampires
          and very strong physical attackers.

          Mateus has summoned four Vampires to help her out. They are very
          dangerous and can prove quite a bit of exasperation. Although the 
          abilities vary from Vampire to Vampire, you will especially want to
          watch out for LV? S-Flare which deals damage to all units with the
          same one's digit as them. Zombify turns your allies into Zombies,
          and Miasma inflicts damage and possible Poison status. 

          Mateus herself is quite a difficulty. With HP in the 400s, she 
          obviously won't be too easy to take down. Weapon Attack is actually
          in 400s as well! With a single strike, she can easily KO weaker 
          units. Spellbind is an ability that damages and Slows. Breath of God
          is a heavy damage radius attack. Star Cross is the same as the 
          Illusionist ability damaging all units with Holy damage. Thundaga
          is fairly self-explanatory.

          Before actually sending in your units, I would suggest using a 
          White Mage to cast Protect and Shell on them. Therefore, they have
          a higher chance of surviving Mateus' damaging attacks. If you really
          want to win, I would suggest bypassing the Vampires altogether. 
          Blind them or Disable them to make them useless and begin going gun-
          ho at Mateus. There really is no trick. To defeat this Totema, you
          are going to need to be a bit more diligent. Good luck.

          Difficulty: Slightly Hard
          Enemies:    Sniper
                      Summoner
                      Assassin
                      Red Mage
                      White Mage
                      Elementalist

          Marche has successfully located a bit of Materite in the Materiwood.
          As so far, no opposition has been encountered so from here on, it's
          smooth sailing. However, from his rear, Marche notices a clan of
          Viera bandits. How could they have known he was here? The streetear
          of course was Doned. Nothing we can do now but engage. 

          Six units should be brought in. You might want to work for units
          that are carrying items making them immune to status ailments; you
          should especially prioritize instant KO. The Assassin is bound to
          give you a few problems with that. Shadowbind and Last Breath are 
          the two that you should avoid as best as possible. Shadowbind Stops
          units right in their tracks and Last Breath deals an instant KO.
          That is not something you want happening. 

          The ranged Sniper will also provide a bunch of problems. Aim: Armor,
          Aim: Weapon, and Aim: Wallet destroys the item that they obviously
          shoot at. Once a weapon is destroyed, it cannot be used again which
          makes Aim: Weapon especially annoying if your unit is carrying a 
          rare weapon. If you are going to knock the Sniper into critical HP,
          be sure that you avoid Doom Archer which deals the lost HP into 
          offensive damage. The move also affects MP. Either KO her within one
          turn or Disable her one way or another.

          The rest of this Viera group consists of magic-casters. The 
          Elementalist, capable of using Spirit Magic, will be a major problem
          for you. Unless you use a Status law card, prepare to fall to her
          various "Elemental damage + Status ailment" spells. Shining Air 
          deals Wind damage and Blind at the same time. Evil Gaze deals Dark
          damage and can Confuse. Heavy Dust is a Earth spell that Immobilizes
          and finally, Sliprain deals Water elemental damage and Slows targets
          down.

          Behind her, the Red Mage reigns supreme as the Doublecasting maniac.
          Doublecast allows her to send out two spells in one, single turn. 
          However, you can rid her of that ability by simply stealing her 
          Madu (Rapier). Because she hasn't mastered Doublecast, stealing her
          weapon will prevent her from using an unmastered ability. Even 
          with Doublecast however, the Red Mage still won't pose much of a 
          threat with Fire, Thunder, Sleep, and Poison. KO her whichever way
          you choose.

          The Viera Summoner is your standard, generic enemy. Remember that
          Summon spells have a much larger radius of effect than normal 
          spells. All spells will affect units two tiles out horizontally and
          vertically and one tile diagonally on each corner. If you group your
          units together, your Summoner will wreak havoc. Make sure she
          doesn't take the best of you. Madeen, dealing heavy Holy damage,
          will be very hard to recover from. And finally, the White Mage has
          four simple yet powerful spells. Curaga cures HP, Esuna heals 
          status, Auto-Life revives to full HP, and Shell protects from 
          harmful magic spells. 

          The way you choose to tackle this battle is your choice. I always
          like to take down the Assassin first followed by the White Mage. 
          Without the White Mage, your enemy team is incapable of reviving
          fallen allies as well as becoming very lacking in the ability to
          heal. The Assassin should be taken down early just to avoid her
          annoying techniques. As a possible strategy, group all your enemies
          by the cliff in the northwest corner and push them off for heavy 
          damage and of course, lots of laughs.

                      Mog Knight
                      Gladiator x2

          Despite the "run-in" with Doned, Marche and Montblanc were still  
          able to get Nono to make them a legitimate gift in time for Present
          Day. At the start, Montblanc will comfort Marche on the fact that
          the palace won't even recognize him. Walking a bit forward, the two
          of them enter the palace... Nono's gift, the "Lugaborg" is sure to
          get them in. 

          In the palace waiting room, Marche begins to complain about the 
          waiting time. Everyone else has already gone. Montblanc responds
          suggesting that something may be... wrong? If there was some kind 
          of trouble, then the two of them were in deep waters indeed. Behind
          them, a door opened and a group of palace guards enter. It seems 
          that they've figured out who you are. A tip from a concerned citizen
          was their lead; the concerned citizen obviously being Doned.

          This battle may be a bit problematic because of the tiny size of 
          the arena (Heck, we are fighting in the palace waiting room). 
          Luckily, the opposition has the same problem as well. If you bring
          in a Summoner, you can probably expect your enemies to be grouped
          up together. When they do just that, give them a full-powered taste
          of magic. Because of the lack of space, magic units would do very
          well. However, be sure to not group up your units either or you 
          might be forced to make sacrifices.

          Leading the offensive, the Bangaa Templar is nightmarishly strong.
          He excels at Weapon Attack and Weapon Defense so you might want to
          Disable him before he gets too far. Because of Bonecrusher which 
          counter-attacks with an added 1.5x to Weapon Attack, avoid close-
          range attacks. Ability-wise, Astra nullifies the first status 
          ailment against an unit, Warcry lowers Speed of surrounding units,
          Rasp deals MP damage, and Haste speeds an unit up.

          The two Gladiators can be dealt with much quicker, but their Weapon
          Attack are really high. The elemental "Spellblade" attacks will be
          sure to pose some problems for your units. The standard Rush, 
          Beatdown, and Blitz abilities make their appearance as well. Do 
          take precautions when using the Fight move at close range. The
          Reaction Ability, Strikeback, will nullify the incoming attack at
          weapon range as well as following up with an attack of their own. 
          With Weapon Attack in the 340s, you will by all means want to avoid
          that.
 
          The only Moogle here plays his role as a Mog Knight. Mog Attack
          pushes units back one tile while damaging, Mog Lance is a ranged
          attack, Mog Rush is a generic high-powered and low-accuracy attack,
          Mog Shield helps defend by casting Protect and Shell on himself, 
          and Mog Aid heals HP. However, although Mog Knights are normally
          dangerous, the lack of Reaction Ability or Ultima Charge makes this
          Moogle a bit less threatening. Nonetheless, take necessary pre-
          cautions and watch it. 

          The only magic-caster plays an Alchemist job set. You will want to
          especially watch out for Death, which will deal an instant KO. 
          However, if you notice that Death has not been mastered yet, know
          that if the Life Crosier is stolen, the enemy Alchemist will have
          no access to that move. Use that to your advantage. Other abilities
          consist of Flare which deals heavy damage, Poison which of course,
          Poisons, and Toad which inflicts Frog status on an enemy unit.

          As stated before, magic-casters or radius-damage attacks work very
          well in such a small arena. The Templar will most likely play the
          battle by casting Haste on his allies. The three Bangaas are the 
          ones you want to watch out for. All three have very high Weapon 
          Attack which can be devastating to the magic unit lacking in Weapon
          Defense. Once those three are out of the way however, the remaining
          portion of the battle is a cakewalk. 

          Difficulty: Hard
          Enemies:    Biskmatar (Llednar)

          With the initial opposition defeated, more guards begin to run in.
          By now, it seems as if getting through would be impossible. 
          Suddenly, Mewt's Nu Mou servant, Babus, appears. Instead of going
          against you however, Babus Stops the guards right in their tracks.
          Confused by this sudden change of position, Marche asks Babus why
          he's helping him. Responding, the Nu Mou states that he wishes to
          know more about what is going on with these "worlds." 

          Babus soon warps you to the Prince's throne room. Mewt is pacing 
          along. Babus brings Marche up, and Mewt is instantly angry to see 
          him. Knowing he hasn't got much time, Marche tries to reason with
          Mewt as quickly as possible. Mewt realizes that even Babus is now
          against him. Before Mewt could be changed, Remedi warps in to 
          comfort him. However, Mewt is taken away... and Marche is left with
          nothing...

          To add insult to injury, Llednar has been summoned to rid the palace
          of this presence. Babus agrees to help, but Marche tells him to 
          try to trace where Mewt and the Queen had gone. However, as of now,
          Marche must engage with Llednar... You should notice that the 
          barrier protecting Llednar from damage is still active. Therefore, 
          the objective is not to win, but to SURVIVE. The amount of turns 
          required is five, but that won't be easy. 

          The main difficulty with this mission is the fact that Llednar 
          will most likely take the first turn. However, if you leveled up 
          Marche as a Thief or a Ninja, you might prevail and take the first
          turn. If you aren't faster, then pray that Llednar doesn't use 
          Omega. If he lands that, the battle is already over. Use your turns
          wisely by running away from Llednar every single turn. In order for
          Llednar to use Omega, he has to be right next to you. 

          Therefore, I recommend that for your first turn (If you survived),
          you run in the opposite direction. Therefore, Biskmatar Llednar will
          be forced to use Abyss which Poisons and damages. However, that is 
          easily solved with Potions. Spend five turns running away from 
          Llednar if you want to win. In the end, the Judgemaster will make
          his presence, and the battle is over...

                      Juggler
                      Animist
                      Blue Mage
                      Mog Knight
                      White Monk

          Now that we're out mythril hunting, Doned will be sure to try to
          interfere again. Marche walks into the Tubola Cave area pretending
          to be searching for mythril. A voice splits the area. "Stop! Thief!"
          Marche is dumbfounded. The enemy group states that Marche is 
          stealing their mythril. Apparently, Doned has turned him in... 
          again! Surrounded, Marche has no other options but to engage. 

          When you bring in your units, be sure that you position them so 
          they can take attacks from both sides. With three units on one side
          and three units on the other, your position is flanked. The first
          of your opponents to move would most likely be the Moogle Juggler.
          The Knife that he holds is one of the strongest in this game. You 
          can easily disable his Weapon Attack by simply stealing it. Watch 
          out for Dagger which damages and Disables. Firebomb can be annoying
          as it Berserks and damages while Smile automatically gives one of
          allies the next turn.

          The Sage will become a pit of many of your problems. Giga Flare is
          one of the most powerful magic spells a Nu Mou has to offer. This 
          move is also second to Ultima Blow in terms of damage. If you group
          your units together, Giga Flare can affect all of them as it is
          capable of dealing damage to multiple units. The last unit on the 
          east side is a Mog Knight. Mog Guard is used to guard himself. Mog
          Rush deals heavy damage at the cost of lowered accuracy, Mog Shield
          automatically nullifies one status ailment, Mog Peek detects hidden
          items, and Mog Aid heals HP and status.

          A Bangaa White Monk leads an offensive to the west. Earth Render
          can damage all units directly in front of that unit. It can be
          devastating if you don't watch your unit placement. The White Monk
          is also capable of reviving fallen allies with Revive. Next on the
          list is the Moogle Animist. You should avoid Tail Wag, a Charming
          move, and Friend, a completely wildcard ability with unpredictable
          results. Finally, the Blue Mage finishes off the set with various
          Blue Magic techniques. Twister cuts off 1/2 HP right off the bat. 
          Bad Breath will deal multiple status ailments. Roulette KOs a random
          unit on the field. And White Wind will heal the amount of HP he has
          remaining.

          This battle isn't that tough. The only real problematic units would
          be the Sage or the Blue Mage. The latter can wreak havoc with Bad
          Breath and Roulette. However, ban Color Magic with a law card and 
          his abilities go down the drain. Likewise, ban Skills and the Sage
          is disabled in terms of using his Sagacity Skill. Overall, this 
          story mission is nothing tough. What is soon to come however, will
          be.

                      Lilith

                      Jawbreaker
                      Big Malboro

          On our way to the Deti Plains, Marche comes across a group of 
          monsters in his path. What comes next should be drilled in your 
          head by now. Bring in another five units in addition to Marche
          himself. Before we can find Judgemaster Cid, we are going to have
          to take care of this monster threat first. Cid hasn't arrived yet
          so take your time. As a story mission, you can already expect these 
          monsters to be a bit tougher than some normal engagement. 

          The nearest target, a Coeurl stands valiantly. Blaster is his only
          technique, but each casting will Petrify an unit. Being a ranged
          ability, keeping your units away won't always help. Therefore, I'd
          suggest taking it down before a chance to use it is taken. Even so,
          its Weapon Attack power is fairly high. Ridding the battlefield of
          the Coeurl first will make advancing through the arena much easier
          as there won't be any opposition blocking the front-lower area.

          I normally get stuck up at bottom where the waterfall hits the 
          edge of the map. Usually, if you take down the Coeurl, you can avoid
          any pre-battle traffic jams. However, you might still find that the
          Jawbreaker attempts to impede your path very often. If any of your
          units have levels divisible by three or five, watch out for LV3 Def-
          less and LV5 Death. The latter provides instant death to all units 
          with levels divisible by five and LV3 Def-less lowers the Defense 
          and Resistance of all units with levels divisible by three. Even 
          worse, they both have a 100% chance of hitting if the levels pertain
          correctly.
 
          By this point, you should be nearing the west side of the arena and
          beginning to climb the steps up to the higher level. The Big Malboro
          will be a nuisance with Bad Breath. In short, it is capable of 
          inflicting a large number of status ailments on you with one cast.
          Soundwave is less of a problem as it only Dispels any status 
          enhancements. Further up, a Lilith reigns supreme. Avoid being 
          caught at distances with Twister. Poison Frog inflicts Poison and
          Frog status while Kiss inflicts Doom and Charm.

          I always prefer to take this battle on in order. The monsters aren't
          too smart and usually stick to their area. If you take out the 
          monsters as they come, the battle will flow through. Unless you
          are wearing Galmia Shoes (In which you can just jump up the cliff),
          you will need to transcend through the path anyway. You should end
          at the Thundrake. If you have retained most of your units while 
          pushing through, it will fall easily despite holding Bolt Breath and
          Geomancy.

                      Sniper (Shara)
                      Red Mage (Ritz)

          Our last stop before we head off to Ambervale is Siena Gorge. There,
          we are to find some amber for Judgemaster Cid to create the antilaw
          he needs. Entering the Siena Gorge, a pink-haired girl stands 
          valiantly at the top of a large pass. Laughing for a second, Ritz
          is positioned with her clan. Next to her is Shara. With a sense of
          confidence, Ritz states that when Marche might be engaging them,
          it just seems kind of funny.

          A surprising turn of events, huh? Ritz had never wanted to go back
          home, so this battle was sure to come eventually. Marche enters and
          realizes what is about to commence. For the next engagement, they 
          are no longer acquaintances. Marche is going over that hill. Ritz
          however, will use all her power to stop that. Knowing that she won't
          give up now, Marche prepares to engage. Bring in five additional 
          units and the epic battle between Marche and Ritz will begin.

          We had never battled Ritz and her clan before, so this might be
          something new. Ritz's clan consists of Viera only. She does well
          with a good balance between magic and physical units. You should do
          the same. At the start of the battle, climb up the hill to meet 
          Clan Ritz at the edge. Try not to move further onto the wooden 
          bridge as traffic jams will be sure to start there. Instead, stay 
          back and let Ritz come to you.

          Now that you are in a good position to start your offensive from,
          begin to build up your units and prepare to attack. The first of
          Clan Ritz to most likely move would be the Assassin. With 200 points
          in Speed, she can move pretty fast. Even so, the Ninja Tabi allows
          her to move 6 tiles which can become pretty threatening. Do not let
          her get behind you and use Last Breath. Aphonia is only dangerous to
          magic units as it Silences and Rockseal can Petrify units into 
          stone. Oblivion works by Addling a target.

          The Fencer has mediocre Weapon Attack for a physical unit. Luckily,
          she is fairly lacking in abilities. Swallowtail damages surrounding
          units, Piercethrough works like a Spear-jab by dealing damage to 
          two units directly in front of her, and Nighthawk is a ranged 
          attack. Of the magic-casters, the Summoner will be sure to pose a 
          few problems with her Summon spells. Madeen will deal incredible
          Holy damage. Also, her castings can deal damage to all units two
          tiles away and one tile diagonally from the center of damage. Don't
          group your units together and her spells will be less devastating.

          Taking up a particularly problematic position, the Elementalist 
          will be sure to get in your way. Because all of her techniques have
          status ailments connected (With exception to White Flame), you will
          not only be struck by magic, but also inflicted with certain status
          ailments. Fire Whip deals Fire damage and can also Disable an unit.
          Shining Air will deal Wind damage along with Blinding a target. 
          Heavy Dust deals Earth damage with a chance of Immobilizing. Beware
          of the Elementalshift as well. Once through, you might be taking 
          heavy damage because of taking elemental weaknesses that 
          Elementalshift exploited.

          Ritz's right-hand man (or in this case, Viera) is apparent as a 
          Sniper. Her Weapon Attack is high enough to prove a difficulty. 
          Even so, her abilities are ones to watch out for. I'd mostly 
          recommend banning Missile attacks altogether (Law Card). However,
          if that can't possibly apply to you, I'd suggest you take her 
          down fast. Death Sickle will inflict Doom status from far away. Doom
          Archer deals lost HP in damage against. Aim: Weapon and Aim: Armor
          will destroy the selected item. The last two should be taken with
          caution if you are wearing or wielding any valuable weaponry or
          clothing.

          Finally, the boss herself plays a role as a Red Mage. Ritz is no 
          easy matter to overcome. Her Weapon Attack is mediocre, but you will
          hardly see her actually using Fight moves. As a Red Mage, it is 
          true that Doublecast is apparent. With it, she can cast Fire, 
          Thunder, or Blizzard against you for offensive damage. Magic Pow+
          boosts the Magic Power and therefore makes each hit hurt. Be wary
          of "Sleep + Offensive Magic" combos as well. Being put to Sleep
          can make a unit vulnerable to spells right off the bat. Simply
          Silencing her wouldn't work as Ribbon nullifies all status ailments.
          Not good.

          The main objective is defeating Ritz. Being at the front of the
          group, that objective is easily accomplished if you just feel like
          rushing through the mission. While you fight however, I'd suggest
          you Steal some of the items around. Max's Oathbow, SeventhHeaven,
          and Ritz's Femme Fatale are all very useful items to take. Defeat
          Ritz to take her down. The pass... is now clear. 

     #24 Royal Valley ~

          Thank you for waiting, Marche, I can leave for the Ambervale any
          time. Let's go as soon as you are ready.

                      Illusionist
                      Biskmatar (Llednar)

          Finally, after many obstacles, we find ourselves in the final 
          chapters... Ambervale... the Royal Valley. As Marche is led into
          the area, he denotes the beauty of this palace. Judgemaster Cid has
          located Mewt to this position. As the two walk forward, the music
          stops as they discover Babus lying unconscious on the ground. An
          unknown voice states the fact that he isn't dead... yet.

          Llednar again. As always, he is here for trouble. Not letting you
          pass, Cid pulls out a special Law Card. With the cast, all Laws
          protecting Llednar are nullified. The invincible barrier surrounding
          Llednar will break. Now vulnerable to attack, the Biskmatar still
          fights. Bringing in his units, the battle will begin. This time
          however, you won't be running away from Llednar. Now, you must fight
          him... and thus, defeat him. You have the option of sending in three 
          units of your choice. Unless you want to take Llednar on 
          singlehandedly, I'd suggest you take advantage of that. A White Mage 
          will be very logical for the incoming fight. 

          The Biskmatar's group consists of a Ninja, a Gunner, an Assassin,
          an Alchemist, and an Illusionist. The first three are the main 
          difficulty. The Ninja is capable of using Double Sword. From past
          experience, you know that two high-powered Katanas against you will
          generate a lot of hurt. Along with that, watch out for his ranged
          "Veil" attacks. Fire Veil deals Fire elemental damage and will 
          Confuse an unit. Earth Veil uses Earth elemental damage and can
          Slow a target. Water Veil deals Water damage and will Silence a 
          target. Finally, Oblivion inflicts Addle status on an enemy which
          disallows them to use Action Abilities. 

          The Moogle Gunner is sure to pose some problems. His ability line-up
          consists of Charmshot, Blindshot, Silenshot, and Stopshot. Luckily,
          he doesn't have Concentrate so he can easily be counteracted by
          Blinding him. The nearby Assassin can be particularly dangerous
          using her Corner techniques. Take caution and watch out for 
          Nightmare and Rockseal. No Last Breath makes her much less 
          dangerous. Even so, her abilities will give you many problems if you
          aren't careful.

          The two magic-casters of this group are an Illusionist and an 
          Alchemist. The latter of the two is capable of instant KO with 
          Death along with heavy damage through Flare. Toad should also be
          taken with caution as it turns his target into a Frog. The 
          Illusionist is a master of Phantasm Magic. Included are Prominence
          which deals Fire damage to all units, Tempest which deals Lightning
          damage to all units, Stardust which rains meteors down on all units,
          Soil Evidence which deals Earth damage to every unit, and Wild
          Tornado which initiates Wind damage on all units.

          Finally, Biskmatar Llednar plays a role as the boss. Now that he
          can be hurt, you should no longer run from him. (Remember the 
          Present Day battle?) Wielded are a few useful items. Excalibur is
          a high-powered Knightsword and Peytral is a rare piece of Armor.
          Ability-wise, there's nothing stopping Llednar from using Omega 
          now. Heavy damage will most likely KO your units within a single
          strike. Do your best to avoid that. Life Render will damage and 
          Doom. Don't try to surround him either as Furycircle will just
          push them all back.

          This battle is over once Llednar is defeated. Go gun-ho against him
          and he'll fall beneath your blade. Without his barrier, he will be
          vulnerable to defeat. With that, he crumbles and shall live no 
          more...

          Difficulty: Hard
          Enemies:    Battle Queen (Queen Remedi)
                      Dephs x2 (Famfrit/Adrammelech)

          It turns out that Babus was really just knocked out. Marche succeeds
          in waking him up luckily. The first thing he asks is where the 
          Prince is. We still hadn't gone inside yet so we couldn't have
          completed our task yet. Babus cannot fight anymore. He stays behind
          while both Marche and Cid venture inside the chapel. Once inside, 
          the two of them meet Remedi. With that, she reinforces the fact that
          this world is still an illusion. At the same time, Marche demands to
          know where Mewt is. The Queen then states that even Marche isn't 
          ready to let this world go. Being the moral person he is, Marche 
          admits to liking this world. However, it isn't real. Mewt's voice 
          booms through the air. Suddenly, he appears in the hand of the 
          statue ahead. Mewt still doesn't want to leave...

          Now Queen Remedi is obligated to use any means necessary in order
          to extract Marche from this area. With that, she transforms into 
          Battle Queen mode and summons two Dephs, her own creatures of 
          incredible power. Prepare to fight Battle Queen Remedi and her two 
          creations, a resurrection of Famfrit and Adrammelech. They still 
          have their own tricks up their sleeve. If you ever want to go back, 
          you must defeat the Queen.

          Famfrit on the right is basically a more powerful version of the
          first Totema we had battled. However, you will note that his level
          and stats have gone up considerably. If you thought he was difficult
          before, now he will be a nightmare. Breath of God is still in his
          ability line-up. Still capable of using that destructive casting,
          expect heavy damage. Lightspeed works a lot like Greased Bolt or
          Faster by delivering an attack that bypasses R-Abilities. Presense
          deals damage and knocks a target back one tile. You should already
          be aware of what Demi does. Cutting off 1/2 an unit's HP will hurt.

          In addition to that monster, Adrammelech of the Bangaas will aid
          Remedi and your destruction. Lightspeed is the same move that 
          Famfrit. Firestream is a high-powered Fire attack that deals damage
          to all units standing directly in front of him. Howl of Rage is 
          basically Warcry as it lowers the Speed of surrounding units. Watch
          out for his heavy Weapon Attack. A strike from that will send most
          units into critical HP. 
      
          The Battle Queen herself is no laughing matter. She currently holds
          the highest Weapon Attack out of both her Dephs heathens. However,
          she is currently incapable of using any abililities. Therefore, if
          you can just avoid her bite, then you should be fine. Defeat the two
          Totema clones and then focus on Remedi. Don't allow her to touch you
          however, as a hit from her would take most units down. Defeat 
          Remedi and complete the battle... 

          Is it over...?

          Queen Remedi has been defeated... or not. Mewt appears once again
          and Marche takes this chance in a vain attempt to talk to him. 
          Mewt's beginning to break down finally. While Remedi is weakened,
          Marche does his best and tries to coax with him. The Queen gets up
          again and walks over to Mewt. "I am the wish-gatherer. I am the
          world-maker." No longer is she Queen Remedi. Now she is the pure
          essence that binds this world together. Defeat her... and the wishes
          shall be undone... With that, the Li-Grim brings in two more Dephs. 
          This time, they are Mateus, the Human Totema. The epic battle we had 
          all been waiting for shall begin in the next few seconds. This 
          really is the end. 

          Bring in five units and let the final battle begin. Before we go
          over Li-Grim, you might want to know what the two Dephs Remedi has
          summoned are capable of. The last Totema battle was difficult. Now,
          you are up against two Mateuses. Spellbind deals Dark damage and can
          Slow a target. Breath of God is a new and improved version of 
          Famfrit's original signature move. Along with that, both Mateuses
          have mastered Star Cross which deals Holy damage to all enemy units
          and Thundaga, the Black Magic spell.

          Li-Grim herself is a difficulty. Lucky for you, her Weapon Attack
          has gone down. What appeared however were a bunch of abilities; all
          of them being dangerous in their own sense. Lawshift is one annoying
          ability that is also very unpredictable. Basically, she is capable
          of shifting the Laws to her liking, and Cid has no control over it.
          Amber Gleam acts by Dispeling status enhancements. Her offensive 
          magic (Ricca) consists of Llednar's Omega which deals heavy damage.
          However, Alpha dwarves even Omega in terms of damage! Descent sends 
          in a random Totema and Magi deals lot of damage really, really fast. 

          If you really want to win as quickly as possible, send all your 
          units on a collision course against Remedi. The Mateuses are 
          dangerous, but attacking them will only allow Remedi more time to 
          use Omega or Alpha. From here on, there's really no more strategy.
          The remaining battle depends on your determination and your sheer
          power. Overwhelm Remedi... and the world-thread... shall 
          disappear...

                      White Mage
                      Black Mage (Dolce)

          We enter the battlefield and find the Black Mage Dolce along with 
          three other members. Immediately, Dolce claims he paid for his food,
          but we are obviously aware of his recent crimes. So, get your units
          ready and make that Black Mage pay for all the restaurant checks he
          passed.

          Black Mage Dolce's forces aren't spread out which should make the 
          battle considerably easier. The main threat here is Dolce and his
          powerful Black Magic obviously, but you should also watch out for the
          White Monk. The Soldier should be ignored for the time being, but 
          you should also take note of the White Mage which will constantly 
          heal his team. To avoid making the battle too long, take out the
          White Mage. To further shun Dolce's team, defeat the White Monk too.
 
          End the battle by putting the smack on Dolce. It's pretty easy 
          getting near him, but if you choose to run after him with more than
          one, be sure you spread them out. As you already know, Black Magic
          has radius damage. Dolce will fall pretty quickly and by then, the
          mission is complete.

                      Warrior
                      Time Mage
                      White Monk 
                      Juggler (Lil Gabbana)
                      Mog Knight (Big Gabbana)

          Here we are, yet another Wanted! mission. This time, we are facing
          two of the most wanted figures of the Moogle race. You see both of
          the Gabbana Brothers at the start, along with the rest of their 
          forces. Let's engage.

          You might have some trouble right off the bat here. The Moogle Thief
          has two abilities, and both of them are painful. Steal: Armor steals
          your Armor obviously, and if you are wearing something valuable, 
          you might lose. The other, Steal: Weapon, is even more of an 
          annoyance. Since Weapons usually hold at higher values than Armor,
          if you lose that particular Nosada, Excalibur, etc., you might not
          get it back for a while. Not only that, but this Thief holds Cuisine
          which can quickly heal all of his HP.
 
          The Time Mage shouldn't be taken into too much priority. Quicken 
          might be the only technique which might cause some problems. The two
          Bangaas are a White Monk and a Warrior. The White Monk has Earth
          Render which damages all who stand directly in front of him, along 
          with Air Render and Whirlwind. The Warrior has a few tricks up his
          sleeves however. Greased Bolt nullifies R-Abilities, and Downsize
          cuts off 1/2 of your HP.

          This leaves us with Big Gabbana and Lil Gabbana. Lil Gabbana holds
          just two abilities, but they can pose a few problems. Smile is 
          another way to Quicken, and Dagger Disables and damages. Big Gabbana
          on the other hand is a much bigger threat. His abilities consist of
          Mog Attack, Mog Guard, Mog Lance, Mog Rush, and Last Haste. To win
          this battle easily, defeat the Thief to avoid the Steal: Weapon and
          Steal: Armor ability, followed by Sir Mog Knight.

                      Gladiator
                      Alchemist (Diaghilev)

          If you are engaging with Diaghilev before completing at least Mission
          #2 and training your clan up to level 4-5, you might be in for some
          trouble. However, if you wait before taking this mission and have 
          leveled up to around that point, this battle should be pretty simple
          yet slightly challenging. 
          
          Diaghilev holds his forces towards the north end of the arena. You
          come in towards the south. There appears to be a giant hole in the
          middle of the arena (Do not ask me why the heck that is there) so 
          you can't station your units there. Since Diaghilev is towards the
          far back, I suggest letting your enemies come to you. Lure Diaghilev
          close and when he's in range, pummel him with a physical unit.

          That's the best course of action, however, if you failed to bring
          in a physical unit or you for some reason, can't set up the attack,
          you won't be able to end the battle quicker than you might expect.
          The Dragoon is the main problem here. If you fail to take out 
          Diaghilev within three turns, he will wreak havoc with your attacks.
          Therefore, take the Dragoon out before dealing with Diaghilov 
          otherwise. The objective is to defeat the Alchemist and once that
          is accomplished, the mission is yours.

                      Bishop
                      Dragoon
                      Summoner
                      Templar (Kenan)

          For this month's Wanted! mission, we are going against the original
          palace guard, Kenan and a group of his followers. His allies are
          balanced and can pack a punch if you aren't careful. Bring in your
          units and prepare to show Kenan that a life of crime is like a 
          boomerang; you choose to let it go, but if you aren't careful, you
          will smack yourself in the face.

          The main opposition is like always, the boss of today's battle,
          Kanan. His Templar techniques include the standard Warcry, Soul 
          Sphere, and Haste, along with a special ability, Lifebreak, that 
          deals the amount of HP damage he has taken against you. Kanan's
          weapon at the moment, Kain's Lance, teaches that ability. If you'd
          like, steal it, so you can have access to it as well. (Unless you 
          already have.)

          The Dragoon in this battle plays like Kanan's right-hand man (Or 
          in this case, lizard). Being a Dragoon, he can pack a punch with
          his Breath attacks. Even worse, Doublehand allows him to deal 
          heavy damage with an already powerful Sword. The Archer in the 
          rear has Cupid and Take Aim. Concentrate makes sure that either
          ability will have a high chance of hitting its mark. Unless you
          like your units running around Charmed, defeat him to destroy that
          threat.

          Your two magic casters consist of a Bangaa Bishop, and a Viera 
          Summoner. The first holds the ability Cura, Water, and Aero. 
          Therefore, the Bishop is capable of both healing and dealing 
          offensive magic. The Summoner is a bit more dangerous however. Know
          that Summoner abilities have a larger radius than normal spells
          hitting at the diagonals and two squares out from the target. Beware
          of Ifrit, Ramuh, and Shiva.

          If you Silence the two magic casters, you can defeat their threat
          fairly quickly. The objective here is to simply defeat the boss, 
          of whom in this case is Kanan. Don't allow the Archer to Charm your
          units too often, and keep the Bangaa Dragoon at bay to leave the
          path to Kanan open. Watch out especially for Lifebreak when the 
          Templar is at lower health.

                      Sniper
                      Red Mage
                      Assassin (Rayne)

          The Jagd Helje area is haven to many deadly assassins. Like always,
          be sure that your units don't get KOed. Seeing as this is a Jagd,
          if they die here, then they die forever. Bring in six units to 
          combat Rayne's team. It's four versus six, but Rayne's deadly clan
          will more than make up for numbers.

          The arena is flat except for a few steps and abandoned houses. The
          nearby Gunner will be a pit of many problems. Although he is a 
          Gunner, he hasn't mastered Concentrate yet so he can easily be 
          disabled through use of Blinding. His Gunmanship abilities allow
          him to Confuse, Charm, Blind, or Silence your units so beware of
          them. Last Quicken allows him to automatically gain the next turn
          once his HP turns critical.

          The Viera Red Mage (although she isn't really red) is an able 
          caster of Red Magic. Luckily, she hasn't learned any offensive 
          spells, but Doublecast can allow her to cast out two spells within
          one turn. Cure will heal an ally's HP, Sleep will put a group of
          units to Sleep, and Poison will inflict Poison status. Even though
          Magic Pow+ is evident, it really is useless as she has no offensive
          spells.

          The second most dangerous unit to Rayne is the Sniper. While the 
          Gunner might not have Concentrate learned, she does. With that
          Support Ability equipped, she can use Doubleshot which shoots two
          arrows simaltaneously, Beso Toxico which damages and Poisons, Death
          Sickle which inflicts Doom status, Doom Archer which deals lost HP
          in damage against HP and MP, and Aim: Weapon of which is capable of
          destroying a weapon. My best piece of advice would be stealing her
          Hades Bow. Once it is gone, she will be forced to pop up at point
          blank range in order to use any of her abilities.

          The Assassin Rayne fills the final gap. As an Assassin, a number of
          deadly abilities are available to her. First off, Shadowbind acts 
          by pinning an unit's shadow to the ground. Through that, units can
          be Stopped right in their tracks. Last Breath deals an instant KO.
          Since this a Jagd, you will want to avoid that at all costs. 
          Nightmare puts targets to Sleep while Dooming them. Ague Slows an
          enemy and Oblivion inflicts Addle status. Finally, Ultima Masher 
          deals incredible damage at the cost of 60 MP. Avoid the latter as
          best as you can.

          Status ailments always help to turn the tide of battle in your 
          favor. Take precautions before sending units on offensives or else
          you might have quite a dilemma on your hands. Blind the Gunner, 
          Disable the Sniper, Silence the Red Mage, and take down Rayne while
          her comrades are struggling through their own problems. Try to take
          Rayne out within a single turn to avoid any counterattacks.

                      Gladiator
                      Illusionist (Lodion)

          Jagd battles are always difficult. This particular "Wanted!" battle
          should be no exception. You are up against a full house of six 
          high-powered units so you might want to bring in some units you can
          trust. Luckily, there are no laws, so just bring in all your 
          powerhouse units along with a White Mage if you're paranoid about
          the possible "death."

          The Archer is perhaps the least effective unit. With only Boost,
          Aim: Legs, Aim: Arm, and Blackout, he shouldn't be able to deal too
          much hurt. Also, he lacks Concentrate which turns him into an even
          lesser threat. The Dragoon on the other hand is a bit more 
          problematic. Jump is a ranged attack, Lancet drains HP, and Bangaa
          Cry is a special "Breath" attack that deals more damage, but doesn't
          have elemental backing. Dragonheart is the main problem. Any 
          Weapon strike against him will give him Auto-Life automatically.
 
          Next in line, the Gladiator and Fighter appear to co-exist with
          each other. Luckily, both Spellblade and Fighter techniques don't
          have any real effect as long as your Weapon Defense is up. Blitz
          is a high-accuracy, low-power strike and Beatdown is a low-accuracy,
          high-power strike. Wild Swing deals damage to all units surrounding
          and Rush pushes units back a tile. Unless your team is a bunch of
          weaklings, I don't see how these two will really do anything apart
          from HP damage.

          The Assassin IS a problem however. Shadowbind is annoying in itself
          as it Stops your units, but if she decides to use Last Breath 
          on you following a Shadowbind cast, expect instant KO. Aphonia
          Silences units, and Oblivion will Addle your units disallowing
          them to use A-Abilities. Finally, Lodion himself shouldn't provide
          much of a difficulty. Prominence, Tempest, and Freezeblink are 
          elemental Target All attacks. Wild Tornado is a Wind based Target
          All move, but it shouldn't deal more damage. 

          The real deal here is the Assassin. Shadowbind + Last Breath combos
          will constantly plague your team. Even worse, you are fighting in
          a Jagd so if you fail to revive your units, they are history. 
          Nevertheless, with the Assassin down, you should be able to win
          against the Dark Lord Lodion easily.

                      Icedrake
                      Thundrake
                      Blue Mage
                      Beastmaster

          Well, here we are in Baguba Port. This enemy group is most 
          definitely the culprit. Bring in six units to combat the two Dragons
          along with the rest of the clan. You should preferably bring in
          Dragoons or any other anti-Dragon unit.
 
          Both Dragons may have high Weapon Attack, but their abilities are
          a bit lacking. Ice Breath and Bolt Breath can pose a few threats,
          but apart from that, without Mighty Guard or Dragon Force to boost
          their Weapon Attack, Weapon Defense, Magic Attack, and Magic 
          Resistance, you can easily find a way to take them out. 

          The Archer is no problem. Without Concentrate, simply Blinding him
          should stop him for the entirity of the battle. Cupid and Blackout
          might cause a few problems with Charm and Blind, but as long as you
          strike first, you can easily take him down. The other ranged
          attacker, the Hunter, is provided with Advice, Aim: Vitals, and 
          Addle. Disregard the last ability as it can only affect monsters of
          which you don't hold. 

          The Beastmaster not only is capable of controlling monsters (which
          in this battle's case would be useless), but he is also adept at
          White Mage techniques: Cura, Protect, and Shell. If you think that
          that might cause you some annoyance, take him out with a quick 
          strike. It would be best to take him down in one turn before he can
          heal himself along with others. The Blue Mage completes the set 
          along with being the most dangerous. Although the Dragons don't
          hold their special Might Guard/Dragon Force set, the Blue Mage does.
          Most likely, he will power up the Dragons so beware. Angel Whisper
          is another curing move, but it will also cast Auto-Life on his 
          allies. Not good. 

          Before you go crazy, you might want to focus on the most problematic
          of the enemy units. For me, that would be the Blue Mage. Watch your
          weaknesses and KO enemies as required. Keep in mind that an 
          Auto-Lifed, Mighty Guarded, and Dragon Forced Thundrake is no easy
          matter in terms of taking it down. This is an easy battle as long as
          you don't let your opponent take the advantage.

                      Icedrake
  
          Following in the great Hero Gaol's footsteps, we find ourselves in
          the Koringwood facing off against the "red-armed" fiend that Gaol
          had fought. Along with that, you are also going against a few of 
          its friends. Get your battle routine set, and prepare to fight.

          The enemies consist of a Bomb, a Goblin, a Marlboro, a Firewyrm, 
          and finally, an Icedrake. All of them have fairly high Attack power,
          with an emphasis on the Firewyrm whose Attack power is in the 230s!
          The closest enemy to your starting position is a Goblin, who is 
          relatively weak and not too dangerous. If you can take out the 
          Goblin with a single hit, take it out on the first turn. If not, pass
          it by for the time being, and attack it later. For long-range units,
          aim at the Marlboro on the far side. It has Bad Breath, which 
          inflicts a bunch of ailments if it hits. Blue Mage users, I strongly
          suggest you pick that move up.

          This level is high on one side, with a sheer cliff dropping to 
          toward. If you have a Fighter with the ability, Rush, or a Defender
          with Tremor, you can push an enemy monster off this cliff for 
          incredible damage. Luckily, the Firewyrm starts down there, and has
          to climb up, so you should have to deal with it last without any 
          other monsters getting in your way. This is a difficult fight, but
          only if you don't come prepared.

          Oh boy, here goes Chapter Two of the famous "The Hero Gaol." Anyhow,
          you find yourself at the Aisen Keep, and who else do you find but
          some members of the Aisen 13. They aren't too tough, so let's get
          to work.

          This battle works much like a normal clan battle. There really 
          aren't any redeeming qualities about any of these Aisen 13 members.
          The one with the most abilities would have to be the Fencer, who
          sports the typical Swarmstrike, Featherblow, and Piercethrough, but
          also Nighthawk, a special ranged move similar to the White Monk's 
          Air Render. For the Archers, you should know which one is more 
          annoying, and which is easier. The Viera is capable of Concentrate,
          which makes each of her shots accurate, and the Human really doesn't
          have anything other than Maintenance which prevents stealing.

          When you start to get to work, work your way against the Fighter and
          the Viera Archer. The rest can wait, as they aren't very dangerous.
          The Fighter does have mediocre Attack statistics so it should be 
          taken out quickly. The two Archers both become annoying if you allow
          them to stay alive more than five turns, so make sure they are 
          defeated quickly as well. This battle shouldn't prove too difficult
          for you. Defeat all enemies and complete Chapter 2 of "The Hero 
          Gaol."

                      Thundrake (Gerland)

          Chapter 3 of the "Hero Gaol" takes its setting in Delia Dunes. Your
          party will face off against a group of monsters and the Magewyrm,
          Gerland in a ominous temple-like arena (It may just be me, but the
          music seems WAY too happy for such a desolate place). These Dragons
          are no pushover so make sure you bring in strong units. 

          The main threats in this battle are the Dragons. Both the Bomb and
          the Antlion are nothing special. The Bomb might pose some problems
          with Blowup, but apart from that, it's almost completely harmless.
          Remember that Ice attacks are super-effective against the Bomb,
          but Fire attacks will simply be absorbed. For the Antlion, beware 
          of LV? Def-less only if your units have levels divisible by three.
          If not, you can pass it off.

          The Red Panther has nicely balanced Weapon Attack statistics. 
          Luckily, its abilities won't help its chances of surviving. Poison
          Claw deals damage and has a chance of Poisoning. Rend is basically
          a damaging move with some cool animation. 

          The Dragons are the main problem. You will most likely have some 
          trouble with their outstanding Weapon Attack stats. Don't let them
          get too close or trouble is bound to start. In terms of abilities,
          the Firewyrm has Guard-Off which breaks Defense and Resistance 
          along with Fire Breath. The Icedrake is capable of Mighty Guard of
          which raises an allies Defense and Resistance and Ice Breath. 
          Finally, the Magewyrm itself, Gerland, holds Dragon Force which
          increases Attack and Power and a powerful Bolt Breath technique.

          Before you begin with the elemental Black Mage (Or whatever) 
          spells. Remember that the element that a Dragon represents (Icewyrm
          = Ice, Firewyrm = Fire, Thundrake = Lightning) makes a difference.
          If you attempted a Blizzara against an Icedrake, you will deal no 
          damage because of elemental resistance. If you possibly can, Blind
          your opposition and the battle will become much, much easier. 
          Defeat all enemies and win the mission.

                      Defender x2
                      Vampire (Lord Ghost)

          It seems that the keeplord of Salika Keep has come back as an Undead
          creature to challenge anyone that opposes him. Along with him are
          his guards and comrades. It may just be me, but these "Gaol" 
          missions really are becoming strange indeed. Bring in six units and
          make sure that one or two of them excels in Holy attacks.

          The two Defenders play a role as the Lord Ghost's guards. As guards,
          you might want to take them out first. The one on the right has two
          Defender techniques: Hibernate which cures status ailments and
          Mow Down of which deals surround damage at the cost of losing all
          Evade for the entire next turn. The Defender on the left has those
          two abilities along with Aura. This move casts Auto-Regen and Auto-
          Life on self so be sure that Defender doesn't have enough time to
          use it.
          
          The Moogle Time Mage is capable of Haste, Quicken, and Slow. Avoid
          having your already slow units getting Slowed even further as your
          progress can easily be stunted. A Hasted Lord Ghost isn't a good
          thing either. The White Mage on the Vampire's right doesn't really 
          do anything except for healing of course. However, if you Charm 
          him, he'll most likely use his Holy curing moves against the Vampire
          for HEAVY damage. If you possibly can, take advantage of that.

          The Lord Ghost himself is a generic Vampire sprite with exceptional
          Weapon Attack. Beware of LV? S-Flare if any of your units have the
          same one's digit as the Lord Ghost. If they do, he can use LV? S-
          Flare and heavily damage whoever. Miasma damages and Poisons while
          Zombify turns one of your units into a Zombie. The latter should
          most definitely be avoided at all costs.

          The Lord Ghost does have one weakness: Holy. Therefore, you will
          find that Paladins and White Mages will wreak havoc. However, do
          remember that Undead monsters always regenerate within three turns.
          If possible, leave the Vampire for last and pick off his allies
          to make the battle easier.

                      Mog Knight x2

          Entering into the Eluut Sands area, you find a group of Moogles of
          whom you must fight. Bring in your six units, and prepare yourself
          for a fight.
 
          You are up against six Moogle enemies, all of them fairly dangerous.
          Keep in careful mind of the Gunner, and the left Mog Knight. The 
          Gunner holds some status ailmenting shots (Charmshot, Blindshot, etc)
          but he also holds the S-Ability, Concentrate which allows him to 
          shoot from any angle with grim accuracy. You will want to take him
          as soon as possible. Second, the more powerful of the two Mog Knights
          also holds certain Gunmanship abilities along with an Attack power
          of 200!

          The Time Mage isn't dangerous, but it should also be priorized to
          make the battle much easier. The Animist isn't dangerous, but can
          be a problem as it likes to help his allies with Cuisine which 
          restores HP back to 100%. The Black Mage should not be bothered
          with at all, until all the more dangerous enemies are defeated. 
    
          A ranged attacker would be smart here. Send your long-range unit 
          toward the Gunner. Follow up with a few physical units against both
          of the Mog Knights. Before concentrating on any of the other 
          opposition, the Gunner and one or two of the Mog Knights should be
          down and out. Following, take out the Time Mage, then the Animist,
          and finally, the Black Mage. If you take them out in that order, you
          should win it.

          across what appears to be an Antlions nest... obviously judging by
          the high number of them ahead of us. Anyhow, prepare yourself for
          battle... again.

          The main difficulty here is the Coeurl. It's Attack Power is rather
          high, so it can usually take a unit out within two turns if you 
          choose not to heal. Therefore, healing Potions and Hi-Potions are
          recommended here. A few Pheonix Downs couldn't hurt either. Beware 
          of the Antlion's ability, Counter. Long-range units are practical 
          here, as they make defeating the Coeurl much easier. Leave the Goblin
          for last as it lacks any real ability, thus making it not that big
          of a threat.
                      
          Keep your units alive and heal if necessary. With defeating all the
          monsters here, you have cleared the Antlion nest and seem to have
          found the legendary Moogle village... No matter, you finish the

          Enemies:    Bomb x4

          If you are a newbie at this game, this mission might cause some
          problems. After all, it is one of the first missions. Anyhow, you
          shouldn't have "too" much trouble with these Bombs.

          The mission starts off with you on a lower area. The Bombs are 
          scattered throughout. Since Fire is weak to Ice, just use a Black
          Mage's Blizzard attacks to put them out quickly. Fire attacks are
          not useful as they simply replenish the Bomb's health. You will have
          to keep in mind that the Bomb's are capable of healing each other
          with their "Flame Attacks." If they use that move against you, 
          prepare them for some hurt. Take them out as quickly as possible to
          avoid getting too deep into the battle. The faster you cut the 
          battle, the better.

          Enemies:    Tonberry x2
                      Masterberry
 
          It seems the sleek and silent Tonberries have committed yet another
          crime. Head to Muscadet and engage. Your enemies consist of a 
          group of three. Two Tonberries and a single Masterberry make up
          your enemy force. This isn't your average monster battle so be
          careful with whom you choose.

          The two Tonberries are nothing you haven't seen yet. The main 
          problem is the fact that they don't actually attack, rather, they
          use the Knife attack which cuts out 9/10 of your health right off
          the bat. Karma is a strange move. It deals damage for each unit 
          that the target has KOed. You will want to watch out for that
          especially. The Masterberry is the spawn of all the main problems. 
          Knife is the original "cut-out-9/10-HP" attack, but replacing Karma 
          is Voodoo which basically Dooms its target. I'm sure you don't want 
          that to happen. 
     
          There is one weakness that all Tonberries hold; they have sucky
          Move stats. Although their Speed statistics rock the house, they
          can only move two tiles at a time which you can definitely use to 
          your advantage. Use long-range units or magic-casters to take these
          Tonberries out from a distance. Defeat all of them to complete the
          mystery.

                      Paladin
                      Dragoon
                      Defender
                      Illusionist

          The purpose here is simple. Your objective is to defeat your 
          opponent in a dead-heat battle. It is going to be your five versus
          your enemy's five. Once you are ready, begin the battle and let 
          this game begin. Your opponent has laid out their units 
          strategically. The strongest is in the center with the first line 
          made up of physical units. The weaker magic-casters are placed 
          behind the offensive line. Because of the fact that you both start 
          really close to each other, whoever takes the first turn usually 
          inflicts the first strike. 

          The Dragoon is in the middle. Being a Dragoon, he is capable of the
          three "Breath" attacks as well as the Templar Warcry. Don't try to
          fight him at point blank or else Strikeback will get the best of 
          you. The nearby Defender holds Tremor, Drop Weapon, and Aura. Again,
          he also holds the Templar Warcry. The Paladin is very ineffectuous
          in terms of abilities as he is only capable of Defense and some
          White Mage healing techniques. Nevertheless, his Weapon Attack can
          still pack a punch if you aren't careful. I'd suggest taking him
          down early so he can't heal. The magic units consist of an 
          Illusionist and a Sage. The latter poses quite a problem with Giga 
          Flare and Bio. 

          I choose to tackle this mission by defeating the Paladin first to
          destroy their chances of healing. Following, I usually take down the
          magic-casters leaving only the remaining physical units to fend 
          for themselves. By this point, the battle is already won. The reward
          for this battle, the Sequence, is a very special weapon. Everytime
          you win it again and again, its Weapon Attack statistics increase 
          by one. If you are patient, you will eventually have the most 
          powerful weapon in the game.

                      White Mage
                      Black Mage

          Because this is a Mage Tourney, all physical attacks will be 
          penalized. The set laws for this tournament are based off of 
          Color Magic. If you do not use Color Magic for every turn, you will
          be given a Yellow Card. You know what to do. If you don't have up to
          four magic units, this battle might be tough as any other units 
          cannot be used. Your enemies consist of the four Color Mages. They 
          consist of the Viera Red Mage, the Human Blue Mage, the Nu Mou White 
          Mage, and the Moogle Black Mage.

          First on the lineup is the Red Mage (Although she isn't really Red
          in color). Notice that her Thunder Robe nullifies Lightning strikes.
          Therefore, avoid using Lightning against her. Her magic spell lineup
          is simple, but Doublecast makes sure that two spells in a row will
          pack you a punch. The nearby Blue Mage is less of a threat, but he
          can still be a nuisance. Luckily, he lacks some of the higher end
          Blue Magic spells such as Bad Breath. Don't group your units 
          together or you will be victimized by Twister.

          The Moogle Black Mage is the offensive unit of this group. Luckily,
          he only knows spells up to the "-ara" suffix of elemental attacks.
          Even so, with Magic Power at 294, expect to be hurt anyway. Return
          Magic will slingshot a spell back at caster so beware. Finally, the
          White Mage provides support through healing with Cura, reviving 
          with Life, and casting both Protect and Shell. 

          Anyway, to win this battle, you need sheer power over strategy. 
          Because you can really differentiate your units too much, don't
          expect too many possibilities. I'd suggest just leveling up until
          your Magic Power beats their's. Upon defeating this group of four,
          you will receive the Sapere Aude. Everytime this mission repeats 
          itself, you have the opportunity to win it again. For every battle
          that you win it again, the Magic Power goes up by one. Level up the
          Sapere Aude to make it powerful.

                      Gladiator
                      White Mage
 
          Swimming, huh? For this tournament, you appear in an arena filled
          with water. The objective is to defeat the other team while you
          transcend the water. Keep in mind that stepping into water disallows
          a unit from performing any actions. Therefore, you should use units
          holding Feather Boots as they can just walk over the water! Also,
          don't bring an unit with Galmia Shoes. That's just stupid.

          Luckily, your opponents have the same disadvantage. However, they 
          will be diligent in taking you down. The Archer is the only ranged
          attacker so she will most likely be your biggest problem. Aim: Legs
          can Immobilize you (Not good if you are in the water without Feather
          Boots), Cupid Charms one of your units, and Take Aim is a 100% aimed
          shot. Also, that Archer is capable of Doubleshot and Concentrate 
          which can be particularly annoying. The Dragoon is well-suited for 
          this environment. Jump is a ranged attack which he can use from one 
          of the many islands scattered through this arena. Lancet drains HP 
          if he is ever critical. Don't allow him to use Cheer followed by a 
          Jump. The HP damage would be devastating. 

          The Bangaa Gladiator nearby holds Wild Swing which damages 
          surrounding units and Ice Sword which strikes his opponent with a 
          magical Spellblade. Air Render is a ranged attack and Earth Render 
          deals damage to all units in front of him. If you want to keep your 
          enemies down, the White Mage really needs to be taken out. She is an 
          able healer with Curaga. Esuna heals status and Shell casts a magic-
          resistant barrier around one of her allies. Even worse, she can 
          summon Unicorn to heal HP or Kirin which casts Auto-Regen. 

          As stated before, Feather Boots can make the battle much easier. 
          Since your opponents don't use them, they will have to rely on the
          islands scattered throughout to attack you. I'd strongly suggest 
          taking the central island so your opponents will have few areas to
          attack you from. Once you occupy the central island, you can just
          take down the foe from there. If possible, Immobilize enemy units
          in the water so they can't use actions. 

          Beating this mission will win you the Acadia Hat. When this mission
          repeats itself, you have the opportunity to win it again. Every time
          you re-win the Acadia Hat, i's Magic Resistance goes up by one. 
          If you constantly re-win it, its Resistance will go through the 
          roof.

                      Elementalist
                      Sniper (Villi)

          If you are confused at when this mission will appear, know that you
          must first engage with a number of Encounters that occur beforehand.
          Defeat the Brown Rabbits, Blue Genius, Yellow Powerz, and the White
          Kupos without surrendering once. Once they are all defeated, the
          final Clan League will appear at the Pub. Accept that and prepare 
          for battle in the Bervenia Palace courtyard. 

          It's 4 vs 4 in a dead-heat battle. There are no laws to restrict
          anything so be sure to take advantage of that. You are up against
          Viera that are fairly tough. Be sure to especially take caution
          around the Assassin. Alone, she would be a threat, but with three
          other units with her and Concentrate learned, the Assassin is even
          more of a threat. Last Breath (Instant KO) will easily put you out 
          of commission so do your best to avoid that. Likewise, avoid 
          Nightmare (Sleep and Doom) as well. 

          The two magic-casters of the group are the Summoner and an
          Elementalist. A lot of caution should be taken around the latter.
          The Elementalist is capable of Shining Air of which deals Wind 
          damage and Blinds at the same time, Evil Gaze which does Dark damage
          with a chance of Confusing, Heavy Dust, an Earth move that can 
          Immobilize, and Sliprain the Water elemental spell that can Slow
          your units. You might have a little difficulty with some of the
          Summoner's spells. With Red Magic, she can also put your units to
          Sleep along with Poisoning them. I'd suggest simply Silencing both
          to keep them out of play for a few turns.

          The boss, and the real objective here is Villi the Sniper. 
          Basically, if you are able to take her down, the mission is over.
          However, as a Sniper, she might be a bit difficult. With high Weapon
          Attack, be sure that all arrows against you will deal heavy damage.
          Doubleshot shoots two weakened arrows simaltaneously. Beso Toxico
          deals damage while Poisoning at the same time and Death Sickle 
          inflicts Doom status. Doom Archer can pose a problem if Villi is at
          low health as it deals amount of lost HP in damage. Protect yourself
          from Aim: Weapon as it can destroy your weapon (obviously).

          If you don't need the experience, just send all four of your units
          on a collision-course with the Sniper. If you are diligent, you 
          should take her down within a single turn. However, try not to drag
          on the battle too long as the Assassin will surely be a problem with
          her abilities. Take any approach you'd like, but defeat Villi in the
          end to win the Clan League!

          This battle isn't as easy as it sounds. This will probably be your
          first encounter with the Panthers, one of the more powerful monster
          classes.

          You start off in Lutia Pass obviously. The three targets are right
          ahead of you. All three are powerful and have heavy defense. You will
          need magic or powerful strikes from a weapon to defeat them all. 
          A White Mage is a must and some Pheonix Downs really couldn't hurt.
          Focus on taking out the Red Panthers first as they have the highest
          Attack and Defense statistics. The Goblin is easier, but should also
          be attacked with caution.

                      Red Panther x2
                      Black Mage (Gelato)

          This is a fairly easy battle if you know what you are doing. You are
          up against three monsters and a Black Mage which is pretty powerful.
          However, if you destroy both of the Magic Devices (The shimmering 
          blue objects), the mission is over. Therefore, a ranged attacker is 
          a good idea. 

          If you have a Gunner this early on, you are lucky as these Magic 
          Devices cannot evade. An Archer or similar would do fine, though, 
          they do have a lesser range. Anyhow, the Floateye along with the 
          Black Mage, Gelato, both should be prioritized. The Red Panthers 
          are dangerous, but they don't pose as big as a threat as the other 
          two. If you can keep a constant blow from a long-range unit to the
          two Magic Devices, you should be fine. Have your long-range unit 
          pound away at those two objects while the rest of your party tries to
          keep that unit alive. Defeat Gelato is optional, but I'd suggest
          taking him out to make the battle easier.

          Because of Gelato's incredibly high level, a White Mage is only 
          practical. Try to station the White Mage so that its in range of
          your long-range unit, and the rest of your party. Therefore, you can
          heal both groups without much problem. When both Magic Devices are
          obliverated, the mission is yours.

          Enemies:    Ice Flan x2
                      Zombie x2 (Colin, Lyle, Guinness)

          This may very well be your first encounter with the Undead type of
          monster. This battle is difficult, but if you know what you are 
          doing, it will flow through. First off, Zombies are defeatable but
          they will regenerate after three turns. This may pose a problem.

          Also on the playing field are two Ice Flans. A Black Mage is REQUIRED
          here, unless you happen to have another magic casting unit. I'd
          suggest you focus on those pesky Ice Flans first as they can cast
          Blizzard attacks against you which causes a whole lot of damage. 
          Be sure that you keep that Sage, Auggie, alive or else you lose it. 
          Leave the Zombies for last as they can regenerate. To defeat the
          three Zombies, try to take them all out at the same time within a 
          turn. If one regenerates, you will have to defeat it all over again,
          which is not good. Kill all enemy units and the mission is yours.
        
          By the way, if you haven't noticed by now, the three Zombies are 
          named after the bullies at your school; Colin, Lyle, and Guinness.
          Looks as if they met a pretty gruesome fate if you know what I mean!

          Enemies:    Bomb x3
                      Firewyrm x2

          You walk into the Roda Volcano area and note a bunch of monsters up
          ahead. Bring in six units, and prepare to engage against three Bombs
          and two Firewyrms. Despite their intimidating looks however, they 
          shouldn't prove too much of a problem.

          The Firewyrms have attacks in the 200-units, so you might want to 
          watch out. The Bombs are just your standard issue, so unless they
          really annoy you, you can defeat them later. Apart from the 
          occasional Fire Breath from one of the Firewyrms, you won't really
          be seeing any ultra-powerful attacks. 
 
          The closest enemy to you is a Firewyrm. Focus all your attacks on
          it before attempting to take out the others. The next target should
          preferably be the other Firewyrm, but if it's currently out of range,
          knock out a Bomb or two. Once both Firewyrms are snuffed out, you
          won't get much more opposition or have any difficulty whatsoever,
          unless a Bomb happens to use its Blowup ability against you. Defeat
          all the monsters and win the mission.

          Well, it looks like Clan Ritz needs our help! Head over to the 
          Koringwood to find Ritz and Shara cornered by some monsters and a 
          Juggler. You start off in the southeastern corner, while Ritz and
          Shara are at the western section. 

          You are allowed two more members in addition to Marche. Luckily, 
          that's all that's really required. With the help of Ritz and Shara,
          of who are both at very high levels, you should have no problem. 
          In fact, it's difficult to even try to lose. 

          You might want to focus on the Sprites first. They hold the White
          Wind healing ability which can become an annoyance. Following, be
          sure to take out the Juggler as well to avoid his arsenal of 
          abilities. You will want to watch out especially for Ring and Ball.
          Defeat all enemies to win the battle, and save Ritz and Shara.

                      Lamia x2

          So you step into the Ulei River area and notice that monsters have
          decided to make their presence known. Well, we better find that ring
          even if getting to it means a little engagement.

          All monster fights thus far have probably been easy. Well, this 
          isn't. The Goblin is the least important monster here. Focus the
          majority of your attacks on the single Lilith as it holds incredible
          Attack Power and is a nuisance overall. However, the single Lilith
          is at the rear of the level so you won't need to attack her first.
          The Sprite becomes annoying, especially with its White Wind healing
          move. Luckily, it's exceptionally weak so you should take that out.
 
          The key to this mission would be to take out the Lilith quickly as
          explained. With her out of the way, you won't have to comprehend with
          Poison, Charm, Doom, or Frog status ailments. Defeat every monster to
          find the ring we are in search of as well as completing this not-so-
          easy mission.

                      Ahriman
                      Beastmaster
 
          Let's get the lowdown on the battle field. You are up against two
          Floateyes along with a more powerful red version known as the 
          Ahriman. The Beastmaster may appear useless, but he is capable of
          White Magic just as well. 

          The first enemy you might want to take care of would be the Ahriman.
          It has high attack power and can easily put your units into the 
          critical zone. Beware of the Floateye and Ahriman abilities Stare
          and Circle. The Beastmaster can heal his monsters, but he can't
          attack too well so focus on the Floateyes. It's just a normal battle
          after the Ahriman is killed off. One thing to remember however, do 
          not attempt to surround a Floateye in an attempt to flank it. 
          Floateyes can fly (Well, judging by their wings) right over your
          units. 

          Just cut away at everyone's health and you should be fine. This is 
          no difficult battle no matter what level you are at. If any of your
          units faint or get hurt, items always work.

                      Red Panther x2

          For the Desert Rose mission, you are to find a special flower near
          an oasis. Obviously, seeing as this is an engagement mission, we run
          into some monster opposition. Bring in your standard set of units
          and prepare for battle.

          Your initial Antlions aren't the greatest threat in this battle.
          LV3 Def-less is a 100% accuracy Defense and Resistance breaker which
          can only affect units with levels divisible by three. Sandstorm is
          the standard surround move which Blinds and damages. For the 
          Jawbreaker, you will note both LV3 Def-less and LV5 Death. The latter
          is an automatic KO for all units with levels divisible by five. Mark
          my words, don't bring in units with levels divisible by five. That's
          just stupid.

          The Sprite can provide some problems with the heavy damage Meteorite
          attack. The last of the monsters here include two Red Panthers. 
          Poison Claw is simple enough to understand. Just try to avoid getting
          Poisoned yourself. Rend is basically an attack with no side effects,
          and Reveal can locate invisible units such as Concealed Snipers. 
          Beware of their high Attack stats.

          Focus on the Antlions and Jawbreakers. You should also send a 
          single unit against the Sprite as it has low Weapon Defense, and 
          you don't want it raining meteorites on your units. The Red Panthers,
          although intimidating, shouldn't provide much of a problem. Like
          most battles, defeat all monsters to win this battle as well as the
          mission.

                      Red Panther x3

          Here we are with Mission #52, yet another monster battle with some
          simple monsters. Bring in your six units to the battlefield and
          engage against three Red Panthers, a Cream, and a Coeurl.

          This battle should be no trouble considering that you should now be
          able to rip these monsters to shreds. You won't have too much trouble
          with the Red Panthers, except for perhaps Poison Claw. The Coeurl
          has a higher Weapon Attack, and Hastebreak, which either Slows your
          units, or breaks any Haste casted on them. Finally, the most 
          difficult enemy here, the Cream holds Thundara, Acid, and a self-KO
          healing move, Sacrifice.

          The order in which you defeat these monsters doesn't really affect
          anything. Because the Cream is only affected by magic, you might want
          to zap it with a quick shot of some Fire/Ice elemental attack. The
          Red Panthers and Coeurls should fall easily beneath your very blade
          and crumble on the floor.

                      Hunter x2

          I guess it's time again to teach these low-lifes that poaching is
          bad. Here at the Baguba Port, you are up against a group of enemies
          who are willing to use all means necessary to escape the wrath of
          the law. However, even low-lifes know how to defend themselves. 
          Bring in six units you can trust and start the battle.

          Apart from the two Thieves, your enemies are long-range units. You
          should be sure to bring in some long-range units of your own to 
          counteract them. Anyhow, the closest opponent is a Human Thief. 
          His Steal abilities won't deal too much of a threat, but Double
          Sword is deadly. Holding two Knives, that Thief can get two strikes
          in. His other Ninja Skill is Oblivion which Addles your units 
          disabling Action Abilities.

          The other Thief, a Moogle, is more of a utility unit than an all-
          out attacking unit. In terms of Steal abilities, you won't really
          take too much trouble from Steal: Shield, Steal: Access., Steal:
          Helm, and Steal: Gil. However, the two Juggler techniques he owns
          can pose a problem. Dagger damages and Disables, and Smile 
          automatically gives an ally the next turn.

          There are also two Hunters on the bandwagon. Their Weapon Attack is
          in the 290s so you might want to be a bit careful. Sonic Boom is a 
          radius-damage attack which can demolish your team if you group them
          together. Aim: Vitals inflicts a random status ailment and Addle
          disables your unit in terms of A-Ability. You might also want to 
          watch out for Battle Tech which consists of Powerbreak, Mindbreak,
          Magicbreak, and Speedbreak. Fighter Tech consists of Rush, Beatdown,
          and Blitz.

          All Gunners are annoying. Especially those with Concentrate 
          equipped. To your luck, the Gunner of this battle happens to have
          Concentrate along with almost every Gunmanship technique (Exception
          goes to Iceshot, Fireshot, and Boltshot). Yep, that means the 
          three big ones: Charmshot, Confushot, and Stopshot. The Archer on
          the other hand is less of a threat, but still can be dangerous. 
          Concentrate is still equipped, and in addition to some simple Aim
          abilities, certain Assassin techniques also make appearance. Aphonia
          Silences, Nightmare Sleeps and Dooms, and Ague Slows her target.

          It might be a bit difficult to start off here. Every unit has its
          ups. However, if you know what your weaknesses are right off the bat,
          then you should know who to attack first. If you think your team
          will crumble once your Paladin (or some other high-powered unit
          is Charmed), you might want to deal with the Archer and Gunner 
          threats first. Likewise, if you rely on weak magic units, you might 
          want to take out the Thieves and Hunters.

          In the Materiwood, you locate Leanan the Summoner, but she's in a

          go and knock these monsters out. Bring in a few, trusted units and
          begin the battle.

          Many people have trouble with this mission because of the fact that
          Leanan starts so close to the monsters. If your units aren't quick
          enough to stop them, Leanan will most likely fall pretty fast. Once
          she is KOed the battle is basically over. Therefore, take necessary
          precautions. You can use a Paladin's Cover to take damage for her
          or use a White Mage to cast Auto-Life on her. 

          If you saved Leanan and kept her alive for the first turn, the 
          battle is easy going from this point forward. The Firewyrm will 
          probably be your biggest problem. Guard-Off knocks down Defense and
          Resistance and Fire Breath is particularly damaging. With Weapon
          Attack in the 300s, you might have a bit of trouble around this 
          Firewyrm. Second in terms of overall toughness is the Red Panther.
          Beware of Poison Claw as it (obviously) Poisons.

          The Titania might pose a threat, but only if the day of months play
          against you. LV?D Holy deals damage to units with the same level as
          the day of month. As long as the day of month doesn't match any of
          your units' levels, you should be fine. The Sprite is less of a 
          danger, but Meteorite can still deal some damage. Finally, the 
          Malboro can wreak havoc if its Bad Breath attack lands a hit. Make
          sure that doesn't happen.

          Again, if you saved and kept Leanan alive for the first turn, the
          rest of the battle should be smooth sailing. However, do not let
          Leanan get KOed even afterwards. The Firewyrm is not affected by
          Fire attacks so don't even try it. You might want to target the
          Titania as it holds Angel Whisper which is capable of healing both
          HP and casting Auto-Life on one of its allies. Don't let that happen
          and take that Titania out as quickly as possible.

          This mission is fairly easy as by now, you should already have had
          enough experience with engagement. Not only that, but your clan 
          should be well-rounded and experienced enough to take these butt ugly
          creatures as well.

          Apart from the Red Cap which might cause some problems, these 
          monsters should be a piece of cake. Magic users should beware of the
          Red Cap's Magic Hammer ability which pulls off quite a bit of MP 
          with each strike. The key here is to end the battle quickly. Do that
          by sending two physical units at the Red Cap and the having the 
          remaining units each take a monster of their own. If you do that, 
          the battle should end quickly. Monsters don't have that great of 
          Speed stats so you should be able to take a few out within the first
          turn. Tear away and win this easy battle.

          Difficulty: Slightly Hard
          Enemies:    Ninja
                      Gunner
                      Sniper
                      Defender
                      Red Mage
                      Time Mage

          Siena Gorge is haven to many clans. While searching for Amber in
          the Siena Gorge, you come come across a group of enemies. Their 
          intentions appear hostile, so we might as well engage. However, this
          battle can become tough so make sure your clan is well-rounded
          and ready to fight.

          First off, the Human Ninja commands his position. As a well-leveled
          Ninja, he might pose a problem at the beginning of the battle. 
          Double Sword allows him to deal heavy damage by swinging two Katanas
          at your face. Along with that, he is also capable of casting a 
          number of "Veil" spells. Specifically, Fire, Wood, Earth, Wood, and
          Metal will all make their appearance. The status ailments connected
          to each one are particularly troublesome.

          The Moogle Gunner can prove to be some difficulty, but it won't
          cause too many problems. The lack of Concentrate makes it so that
          attacks against you won't have insanely high accuracy percentiles.
          The nearby Sniper will be much more threatening however with a 
          larger ability line-up. Doom Archer and Aim: Weapon can both be 
          troublesome. For that, I'd suggest Blinding her. Aim: Armor can 
          also be a problem if it lands a hit. 

          The physical unit of this group is a Bangaa Defender. As a Defender,
          his Speed statistics are as low as anything. You can even further
          delay his turns by reducing his Speed or inflicting Slow on him.
          Even so, Earth Render causes problems as it deals damage to all 
          units in front of him. Aura works by casting Auto-Life and Auto-
          Regen on himself. Before he has a chance to use that on himself, 
          KO him. Disabling would work too.

          The Viera Doublecaster (aka the Red Mage) will very likely be a 
          threat. If she happens to use Doublecast on you, be wary of "Sleep +
          Poison" combos. By putting your units to Sleep, Poisoning that unit
          will damage HP while the unit is dozing. For the Time Mage, you just
          want to avoid Demi. Meteor is an Alchemist technique which also 
          might appear occasionally. Do not group your units together or he
          will most likely cast Meteor into that group. With heavy damage, 
          you will take casualties.

          The enemy group here is well-split and balanced between magic-
          casters and the physical units themselves. Follow up with a good
          balance of your own. Remember that Silence will easily keep a magic
          unit out of commission for a few turns (With emphasis on the Time
          Mage and Red Mage here). For physical units, Disabling them or using 
          Blind should help you out.

          Enemies:    Templar x2
                      Defender x2

          Here we are helping a "troubled" inmate escape certain containment.
          Apparently, our nightly prison break failed to get past the eyes of 
          the local guard. Julian escaped, but we're stuck here. Stall them 
          so that the young criminal can make take his leave. Stuck doing the
          dirty-work, huh?

          The prison guards really must be on their day off. The alarm was
          issued and only four units came to stop you. Your opposition this
          time consists of two Templars and two Defenders. All four really
          lose in terms of Speed so you can expect to get the first few turns
          to yourself. Use their lack of Speed to your advantage and set up 
          an attack while they wait there.

          The two Templars, as always, are the source of your problems. Heavy
          Weapon Attack make them both very formidable opponents at close
          range. Warcry can be annoying as it lowers Speed. If you are going
          to take them down to critical health, just watch out for Lifebreak
          which deals lost HP in damage. If that strikes you, prepare to be
          devastated. Also, the one Templar capable of Prayer can cast Cura 
          on his allies. Defeat that one Templar and your opposition will be
          incapable of healing.

          The Defenders may have lower Weapon Attack, but as Defenders, their
          Weapon Defense goes through the roof. Needless to say, magic attacks
          would be very useful. However, if you have any elemental weaknesses,
          beware the Spellblades that one Defender holds. Likewise, White Monk
          abilities are evident in the other Defender. While multi-tasking, 
          be sure that you don't underestimate their abilities. 

          I choose to defeat the Templar capable of casting Cura. Therefore,
          once he is down, your opponents will be incapable of healing. 
          Following, you can try to KO the second largest threat in terms of
          Weapon Attack, the other Templar. The more of the guards you take
          down, the less capable your enemies will become. Defeat all four of
          the guards and escape.

                      Toughskin
                      Odd Statue x2

          Bring in your six units, and take a moment to observe your battle-
          field. The main objective of this engagement is not to defeat the
          enemies, rather to destroy the two Odd Statues at the northwestern
          corner as soon as possible. So bring in some long-range units, and
          some physical members if you'd like, and begin the battle.

          All your enemies are fairly well-rounded in terms of stats. The 
          closest enemy would probably be the Lilith. She is capable of 
          inflicting Poison, Frog, Charm, and Doom status on your units so
          beware. The single Titania becomes increasingly annoying later in
          the battle. With LV?D Holy, the Titania can hit all units that have
          the same one's digit as the day of month. 

          Adding to the enemy monsters, you will find a Lamia towards the
          rear. She holds the Poison Kiss ability which is the same as the one
          the Lilith Holds. Along with that, Night puts all units (friend or 
          foe) to sleep on the field. The monsters close off with the Toughskin
          chilling around. Resonate will Disable all physical units, and 
          Matra Magic switches around MP/HP. 
 
          As I said before, bringing in long-range units would be a smart 
          thing to do. With them, get them towards the two Odd Statues toward
          the rear and unleash your arrows, bullets, and whatever into them.
          Have your physical units hold off on the monsters while the others
          take care of the Odd Statues. In fact, it is possible to simply make
          a run for the two Odd Statues and quickly knock them down before
          your enemies have a chance to retaliate.

                      Thief x2

          Well, they had stolen his sketchbook, and with it, the "Sketchy
          Thief" had apparently put one of his sketches to life through some
          strange transformation process. Apart from a drawing Jelly, your
          opponents are your standard engagement grunts. Bring in six units
          to combat this group. Make sure that you take in at least one magic-
          casting unit to take down the Jelly. 

          Your enemies consist of the standard. Two Thieves play a role as
          the main physical units of this battle. The Moogle Thief can steal
          your Armor, Shield, and Weapon as well as being able to use the
          Gunmanship techniques: Blindshot and Stopshot. Concentrate makes 
          it so that all moves have 90%+ chance of hitting. The Human Thief is
          a bit less dangerous in terms of stealing ability. Your Gil, EXP,
          and JP are not safe around him (sarcasm)! Watch out for some of his
          Black Magic however.

          The Archer is the ranged attacker of this group. He holds Aim: Legs
          and Aim: Arms. Furthermore, he also holds Concentrate which improves
          accuracy greatly. The few Battle Tech he holds aren't very useful.
          The Moogle Animist nearby is much more capable. Cuisine heals HP
          to the max while Chocobo Rush creates a giant stampede dealing 
          damage to all units standing in front of and in back of him. 
          Frogsong works by changing an enemy unit into a Frog. By all means,
          Silence him to avoid any problems. 

          Finally, the "drawing" that the Thief brought to life is nothing
          more than a simple Jelly. Like all Flan, this Jelly will only be
          affected by magic. Physical attacks will deal one HP damage and 
          occasionally two. Watch out for his Fire spells however as they
          can deal very heavy damage with each casting. As a side note, do 
          make sure that you don't use Fire against it. The Jelly will only
          absorb them.

                      Dragoon
                      Summoner
                      Assassin
                      Alchemist
                      Mog Knight

          Helping the Bardo Band against the Gertai Band, you venture to the
          Ozmonfield. Awaiting you there are your opponents of the Gertai 
          Band. Send in your six units and begin the battle. You might have
          some trouble here so keep that in mind. 

          Your enemies consist of a full party with six members. Because of
          the elongated terrain, your enemies are spread apart. However, they
          appear to have lined themselves up. The first of your foe, the 
          Paladin, holds Saint Cross and Holy Blade. The latter is a high-
          powered Holy strike which is usually capable of taking down your
          units within a single strike. Saint Cross deals Holy damage to all 
          surrounding units. Nurse and Drop Weapon are self-explanatory.

          Next on the list is the Bangaa Dragoon. The Kain's Lance is a very
          rare weapon that you might want to steal before doing anything. 
          Anyhow, techniques include Jump which is a Dragoon ranged attack,
          Lancet which drains HP, and the notorious "Breath" attacks. The
          Viera Summoner holds a wide variety of Summon Skills. Don't group
          your units too close together or you will easily fall victim to 
          her offensive magic.

          The most deadly of the enemy group is the Assassin obviously. She
          excels in Speed stats which makes her even more of an issue. You
          should probably want to steal the Genji Shield as it is very rare.
          Watch out especially for her Last Breath technique. If it hits, the
          unit is automatically KOed. Equally dangerous is Rockseal, a 
          Petrifying move. The nearby Alchemist is the magic caster of this
          group. Astra is a special status enhancement that nullifies the 
          first status ailment against. Meteor and Flare are both heavy 
          damage attacks. Poison and Toad are self-explanatory, and Rasp
          deals MP damage.

          Finally, the Moogle Mog Knight finishes off this lineup. He plays
          the role as the pseudo-boss of Gertai Band. Clad in nearly all opal,
          he is as shiny (List: Opal Helm, Opal Shield, and Opal Armor) as 
          he is valiant. Mog Guard, Mog Lance, and Mog Aid make up his Charge
          abilities, but he is also adept at using the Fireshot, Boltshot,
          and Iceshot of the Gunner job-set. 

          Apart from Items and the Paladin's Nurse technique, you should 
          realize that the Gertai Band has no other means of healing 
          themselves. It's weaknesses like these that you work upon. Defeat
          all enemies to drive the Gertai Band out. A victory for the Bordo
          Band. Now why did we help them again?

                      Black Mage

          Remember Mission #12 Jagd Hunt? Well, those bandits seem to have
          hit poor Nono again. Head over to the Jagd Dorsa symbol, and send
          in six units to start the battle. This is a Jagd engagement, so 
          be sure you have means of reviving fallen allies.

          You might start off seeing a Ninja who holds the sought after Double
          Sword along with R-Ability Last Haste. Along with him, you have a 
          Blue Mage with Guard-Off, Dragon Force, LV3 Def-less which lowers
          the Defense and Resistance of units with levels divisible by 3, 
          and White Wind. 

          Also playing a role is a Gunner with Concentrate. The Gunner can
          easily become an annoyance so you might want to strike it down 
          quickly. The Red Mage not only holds Doublecast, but also Magic Pow+
          to further add the hurt to her Magic attacks. You will want to 
          watch out for that Red Mage. The Thief is only capable of stealing
          EXP, JP, and Gil so don't worry about it too much. And finally, the
          Black Mage can really hurt your units with its "-aga" ability. 

          Prioritize the Ninja first so you won't have to be dealt with Double
          Sword for the rest of the battle. Following, you might want to
          knock out the Shot-bearing Gunner, or the Doublecasting Red Mage.
          If you are ever KOed, be sure to revive them. I'm sure you will take
          caution here. Defeat the bandits once more, and save Nono's airship
          ... again!

          You are up against three Lamias in this battle. You are allowed to
          send in five members, so make sure you can defeat these three Lamias
          with them. You are fighting in Cadoan, which has a few ups and downs
          so walking through it might be a bit tough.

          The area is split up into an upper area, and a lower area. I'd 
          suggest sending half of your members towards the ledge, and half of
          them to the lower area. Therefore, you won't have to go through any
          time consuming walking. The Lamias are easy for the most part, but
          they hold a terribly annoying ability. Poison Frog will not only
          Poison you, but transforms you into a Frog! Not good. 

          As long as you watch out for that move, you should be fine. The 
          Lamias are easily cut apart, and if you have a Beastmaster with the
          Lamia control ability, the battle becomes easier. Kill off the Lamias
          and you should find a special Mission Item; The Hero Gaol.

                      Ruin Ward
                      Odd Statue x2

          Once again, Professor Auggie has gotten himself into quite a bit of
          trouble. This time, it appears as if he disappeared into some cave.
          During our search, some monsters attempt to engage us. Nearby are
          two Odd Statues that might serve some purpose. Bring in some units
          and begin the battle.

          Your opposition consists of a Bomb, an Icewyrm, a Titania, and an
          Ahriman. The Bomb is no problem with Flame Attack as its only 
          technique (Apart from Blowup). The other three might pose a few 
          problems however. The Icewyrm boasts high Weapon Attack along with
          Ice Breath. By all means, try to avoid it and remember that Ice 
          attacks deal nothing against this Ice-based Dragon. 

          The Titania isn't even a Titania at all. Rather, she plays a role as
          the Ruin Ward. Defending the Tubola Cave, she isn't too tough to 
          say the least. LV?D Holy deals heavy Holy damage to all units with 
          the same one's digit as the day of month. Angel Whisper becomes much 
          more annoying. It heals HP AND casts Auto-Life on one of her allies. 
          The Ahriman's only real threat is Roulette which chooses a random 
          unit and KOs that unit. 

          The objective here is to destroy all the objects meaning the Odd
          Statues. The Odd Statues have very low statistics and their HP is
          so low that one strike would take one down. Ranged attacks would 
          work well so choose your units wisely. Don't let the other monsters
          get in your way however. Take them down first.

          Enemies:    Bishop
                      Time Mage
                      Gadgeteer 
                      White Mage
                      Black Mage
                      Elementalist

          If you want to unlock Jagd Helje, you must complete this mission.
          After receiving the Helje Key from the escapee, Julian, we find 
          ourselves at Tubola Cave awaiting this new "area." Before you can
          enter however, you are going to have to prove your worthiness to
          these hardcore chicks. 

          Before you do anything, note the fact that all your enemies are 
          magic-casters (Even the Gadgeteer is pseudo-magic). Therefore, 
          bring in Templars or Time Mages to counteract them with Silence.
          Any MP-hurting attacks would do good here. Similarily, if you 
          Berserk them, then they will be forced to use Fight moves. Even 
          so, you have one major enemy that will most likely nullify status
          ailments. 

          The White Mage will act as the savior of this enemy group. Until
          you can defeat him, avoid using status ailments as they will just
          be healed. However, while being a White Mage, he can also cast 
          instant KO with the Alchemy Skill, Death. Even so, once the White
          Mage is down and out, the battle becomes easier as you can just
          Silence or Berserk your opponents.

          The Viera Elementalist is very capable of knocking you off your
          feet. Fire Whip damages and Disables, Evil Gaze deals Dark damage
          and Confuses, and Sliprain deals Water damage and Slows. However,
          with Doublecast and the Red Mage technique, Sleep, expect two full
          spells right in your face. With Magic Pow+, her spells deal even 
          more damage. 

          Next in line, you will find that the Black Mage loves Fire. Equipped
          with a Blaze Robe and a Flame Rod, he achieves that burning 
          sensation with style. Luckily, this provides some advantage as the
          only Black Magic spells he can cast are Fire, Fira, and Firaga. 
          Nevertheless, you will still want to watch out for Blue Mage 
          techniques anyway. By now, your units should have levels higher than
          20 so the normally devastating LV? S-Flare will be disabled.

          Nearby, a Time Mage makes his appearance. Capable of Slow, Stop, 
          Silence, and Demi, expect him to be a force to be reckoned with.
          If you don't want to be victimized by Time Magic, take him down with
          some long-range attacks. The Bishop has the largest ability list
          set-up obviously. Most of his spells are just offensive magic 
          however. Still, beware of Break and Holy. The latter deals heavy 
          Holy damage and Break Petrifies units on the spot.

          Finally, the Gadgeteer stands toward the rear with his "one" 
          Pandora ability. Silver Disc is a completely unpredictable move 
          that will Blind either side through a flip of a coin. Being his
          only Pandora ability, the Gadgeteer obviously isn't capable of 
          much. You might find Damage > MP to be the pit of some exasperation
          but it is easily bypassed with moves like Faster or Greased Bolt.
          If you don't have access to those, simply taking down his MP and
          then his HP within a single turn works too.

          This battle can become incredibly easy or incredibly difficult.
          If you fail to work off the fact that your opponents are all magic-
          casters, then you might have some problems. The two most redeeming
          status ailment against these units would be, again, Silence and
          Berserk. As magic-units, their Weapon Defense falls a bit short so
          high-powered physical units, like always, will prevail.

                      Ice Flan
                      Jawbreaker

         Well what do you know? If it wouldn't be monsters we are engaging.
         You know our drill. Bring in six units and prepare to engage a 
         Coeurl, a Grenade, an Ice Flan, and a Jawbreaker. Don't worry about
         difficulty; this is fairly easy.

         The worst of the worst in this case would be the Coeurl. Its Weapon
         Attack power is pretty high, but Blaster will Petrify your entire
         team if you aren't careful. His other ability, Hastebreak, isn't 
         used often, but can still become annoying as it Slows your units. 
         When your Speed-logged Paladin gets Slowed, don't expect him to be
         of too much help as he'll probably get a turn every five other 
         turns.  

         The Jawbreaker is another annoying one. Luckily, as long as you 
         bring units without levels divisible by three or five, you should
         be eased a bit. LV3 Def-less basically destroys the Defense and
         Resistance statistics of units with levels divisible by three. 
         Likewise, LV5 Death automatically KOs all units with levels 
         divisible by five. That is not a good thing.

         The Grenade is a lot easier to take care of, and should really be
         left until the end of the battle. Chill is a radius attack which
         damages, and also heals the Grenade itself. Weapon Atk+ makes Fight
         moves even more hurting, and Blowup is self-explanatory. In terms
         of the Ice Flan, you will want to watch out for Blizzara and 
         a status ailmenting move, Acid.

         With your magic casters, attack the Ice Flan first. If the 
         Jawbreaker or Grenade is a priority to you, take them out with a 
         physical strike. The Coeurl might require a group effort. Remember
         to "un"-Petrify your units with Softs often unless you like a living
         statue standing right there doing nothing. Winning this battle will
         also gain you the Jagd Alhi symbol.

                      Dragoon x2

          Despite the fact that you may have the Wyrmstone, the Delia Wyrms
          are not very giving to requests. To test your determination, you
          must engage with the Delia Wyrms. If you win, they will help. If 
          you lose, say goodbye.

          The Delia Wyrms are led by two Dragoons. Both excel in Weapon 
          Attack. The more powerful of the two is not the boss himself 
          however. The actual Dragoon boss is the one holding the Genji
          gear. The boss Dragoon is fitted with all three "Breath" attacks
          along with Lancet which sucks the HP out of your units. The other
          non-"boss" Dragoon has higher Weapon Attack as stated before, but
          his abilities are a bit lacking. Lancet drains HP and Jump is a 
          ranged attack.

          The Dragons themselves are slaves of the Dragoon's control. Nearest
          the starting position, a Firewyrm stands there looking intimidating.
          It holds Fire Breath which can blaze right through your units. 
          The Icedrake has higher Weapon Attack along with Ice Breath. Mighty
          Guard increases Weapon Defense and Resistance. Finally, the last of
          the Dragons, the Thundrake, has Bolt Breath and Dragon Force which 
          is capable of boosting Weapon Attack and Magic Power.

          The objective here is to defeat the boss Dragoon. If you don't need
          the EXP, you can just put all your units on a collision-course with
          the boss. However strong he might be, he will easily fall to a full
          force of six units. Take him down, and the Delia Wyrms will agree to
          drive the Dragon out of Baguba Port.

          Enemies:    Coeurl (Meow)

          Someone really can't take a hint. The Coeurl that you see here is
          "Meow" itself. Even more of an irony is the fact that "Meow" is a 
          lvl.35 powerhouse. Anyhow, our objective is to bring it back home,
          but "Meow" obviously wants to play a bit longer. Time to take it 
          in by force. Bring in four units and begin the battle. 

          "Meow" is a tough Coeurl to really control. At 350+ HP, it can also
          be a chore to take down. However, with four units, the battle flows
          through much quicker. Meow has two Action Abilities. Hastebreak 
          inflicts Slow status and can break "Haste." Blaster is a ranged
          attack that will Petrify if it lands a hit. The latter should be 
          avoided as best as possible. For "Meow" itself, I'd suggest either
          pounding away at his HP or using Petrify. Simply Dooming him would
          work too.

          While you are only fighting one unit, this mission can become hard 
          if you don't know what you are doing. You are allowed to bring in 
          three units at maximum.

          This battle would go much quicker if only... the Thief wasn't at
          level 7! The Thief is not your ordinary clan war pushover, but a 
          much more powerful one. He has incredibly high attack statistics and
          his R-Ability, Counter, puts the pain with every strike you make
          against him. Because of that, Archers and Gunners are recommended.
          Anyhow, if you bring in two physical units, and a long-range unit,
          you should no trouble bringing the notorious Thief, Dabarosa down. 
          
          Use Potions often and you should overcome the Fowl Thief and complete
          this mission. If you have trouble, you might find it in your best
          interest to Blind Dabarosa so he can't strike. This isn't too hard, 
          just apply yourself to beat him.

          Get yourself to Sprohm and prepare yourself for a slightly difficult 
          battle.

          The battlefield is a major doozy. If you have fought in Sprohm 
          before, you have already experienced it. Why? Because the bumps and
          crazy cliffs are a pain to get around, and unless you have some
          ultra-crazy Jump stats, I don't think climbing these things will be
          easy. Anyhow, you are allowed six units which is a good number 
          seeing that your opponent has only three. You will be engaging a 
          Warrior, a White Mage, and a Thief by the name of Warose, a Clan
          Borzoi Capo. 

          The enemy units are fairly easy, except for the Capo, Warose, of 
          course. I find it best to take out the White Mage before Warose as
          he will constantly heal the rest of the units. If you want to leave
          the Thief for last, you can do a number of things; Disabling him,
          Immobilizing him, or Blinding him. Either of the three will work, and
          by now, you should have access to those kind of abilities. Warose 
          may look tough, but when you defeat his Warrior and White Mage 
          backups, he becomes a piece of cake. Capture the Borzoi Capo and 
          free the conflicting town of Sprohm!

          Difficulty: Slightly Hard
          Enemies:    Black Mage
                      Paladin (Raven)

          For this next encounter with the notorious Clan Borzoi, you are 
          going up against Raven the Holy Knight, and his Black Mage teammate.
          Only four units are allowed in, so be sure you send in a White Mage
          and a long-range unit along with one physical attacker, and a magic-
          caster. 

          The main threat here is Raven. At a whoppin' level 11, he can surely
          put the hurt on your units. Because of his two Holy attacks, Saint
          Cross and Holy Blade, I find it best to keep your distance for the
          time being. Luckily, he only has a Move statistic of 3 so you should
          find it fairly easy to stay out of his Holy Blade radius. The Black
          Mage is also a threat. Not only does it know powerful Black Magic,
          But he is also capable of launching the Blue Mage abilities; Acid and
          Matra Magic against you. Be sure you don't land any of your own 
          magic on him or else you'll be buffetted by your own spells.

          Because the Black Mage has low Weapon Defense, I'd suggest sending
          your physical units against him. Raven, the Paladin, has strong
          Weapon Defense, but his Magic Resistance stats are slightly weaker.
          This is where your magic-caster comes in. Use your long-range unit
          to throw projectiles at Raven to cut away at his health. Defeat him
          to end this Borzoi Capo.

                      Black Mage (Golitaire)
                      Red Mage (Hejaat)
 
          Once you stumble upon the Borzoi base, the Red Mage will engage to
          drive you out. You are allowed to bring in four other units and you
          are engaging against a White Mage, a Black Mage, and a Red Mage.
          That's right, all magic! And another thing, they are all Borzoi 
          Capos. Not good.

          The White Mage is capable of Esuna and Shell, along with two healing 
          moves. The Black Mage is fairly powerful with second rate magic 
          spells (Fira, Thundara, and Blizzara). The Red Mage however, is the 
          greatest adversary here. Not only does she hold the Doublecast 
          ability which allows two consecutive spells in the same turn, but
          she knows Spirit Magic which can really cripple you.

          It's best to take out the Red Mage first as she is the most 
          versatile. If you want to differ, and take out the White Mage first
          so she can't heal, be my guest. Out of all three, the Black Mage, 
          although powerful, is the least important. Win the battle and drive
          Borzoi out of their Nubswood base.

                      Time Mage (Steraiz)

          You are up against two Clan Borzoi Capos, so you can expect the 
          battle to be pretty tough. Luckily, the terrain proves to be fairly
          easy to move around in, so you should have some ease taking all 
          three of them out if you apply yourself correctly. You are allowed
          to bring in only four units, so make sure you choose carefully.

          First of all, you should note that the Black Mage automatically 
          starts off with an Auto-Life. Not good. All three of your opponents
          are difficult. They all hold powerful abilities, and all but the
          Black Mage hold a sub-job as well. The Time Mage can heal his allies,
          and the Sniper Capo holds some annoying Archer abilities. Make sure
          that the units you choose to bring in are well-trained and powerful.
   
          Focus on the Black Mage or Time Mage first. The Sniper can wait, as
          it is the most difficult to kill off. If you have a Bishop who knows
          Dispel, or a Ninja that knows Unspell, you could easily remove the
          Black Mage's Auto-Life. If anything, the Time Mage has to go fast,
          as once it happens to cast Haste on the Sniper, you are in deep 
          trouble. 

          If you are smart, you would have already brought in a White Mage.
          Make sure that you quickly cast something like Protect or Shell at
          the very beginning. Your White Mage should continually heal as
          necessary. Defeat the three of them, to wipe out two more Capos. 
          Only one more to.

                      White Mage
                      Fighter (Gukko)

          Being the final battle with Clan Borzoi, you can expect their last
          piece of resistance to be a heavy one. You are up against their
          boss, Gukko, along with a few of his guards. And they are in no 
          way, a pushover. Let's get this battle underway.

          You start off on the upper level chasing Gukko all the way to here.
          Bring in some physical units, plus one or two magic units, and of 
          course, a White Mage. Your enemies may be pretty heavy with their
          attack power, but their abilities aren't anything you haven't seen
          yet. However, Gukko the Fighter, has a whopping Attack power of 300!
          Therefore, I would strongly suggest you watch out for him. Not only
          that, but the S-Ability Doublesword makes his strikes even more 
          lethal. Some may be able to KO your units with a single hit. All the
          more reasons to bring in a White Mage with some sort of reviving 
          ability!

          The Sniper holds a few normal moves, but it is also capable of the
          Fencer abilities, Manastrike and Shadowstick which will destroy your
          MP, or lower your Speed statistics. The White Monk is another 
          terribly tough adversary here. While its Attack is not as crazy as
          Gukko's, you will still have some trouble around him. Watch out 
          especially for Earth Render, which can hit every unit standing in
          front of him.

          Basically, the shorter you cut this battle, the easier it becomes.
          You can practically cut the battle in half by going full at their
          White Mage. Try to defeat her as soon as possible, and then begin
          focusing on the Sniper and White Monk, while running away to stay 
          out of the Fighter's regular Fight range. Far Fist is still deadly,
          but it is far less effective than Gukko's other moves. Therefore, 
          if you manage to stay far away, Gukko will have to resort to his 
          ranged attack. When the Sniper, White Monk, and the White Mage have
          been taken, go with all your force against Gukko. You should be able
          to overpower him enough to defeat him.

          Enemies:    Bomb x4
                      Mombomb (Mombomb)

          Here we are, a Bomb battle just on the outskirts of the Cadoan town.
          To prevent them from getting into the city itself, you have to defeat
          all of them. However, although four of them play a role as a generic
          Bomb, one of them is a Mombomb...

          The four regular Bombs are fairly easy to take out. Remember that
          these Fire-based creatures are weak against Water or Ice attacks.
          They will also heal each other constantly using their Flame Attacks
          on each other. This generates another precaution; never use Fire
          elemental attacks against these monsters! It will only heal them.

          The Mombomb should generate some curiosity. This monster not only
          holds the R-Ability, Counter, but also boasts Attack power above the
          200 mark! If you brought in Black Mages to take out the Bombs with
          their Ice attacks, do not let the Mombomb get too close to you. With
          low Defense, the Mombomb's heavy Attack will knock you out usually
          in a single blow.

          Don't you find it strange that the mission description states the
          "The Redwings have reared their ugly head in Cyril" but you are 
          engaging in the town of Cadoan. Either I'm missing something or this
          is one of Square-Enix' bigger mess-ups.

          Enter the battlefield, and meet your opposition; two Mog Knights.
          You are allowed to bring in up to four members. They don't have to 
          be your best, as this battle isn't too tough. However, do make sure
          that they are at least capable of simple enemy attack. If you want
          to end this battle quickly, physical units will rip them to shreads.
          
          Your two Mog Knight opposition are different. The higher level of
          the two has the R-Ability, Damage > MP, which converts all HP damage
          to MP damage automatically. Not only that, but he holds the Gunner
          A-Ability Concentrate, and four Juggler techs which can cause some
          problems. The other doesn't have any redeeming R-Abilities other
          than Concentrate, but he does have a few status ailmenting Gunmanship
          abilities.

          Both of these Mog Knights have Attack power around the 220-240 mark.
          Magic-casters with weak Defense will fall if you allow them too near
          to these heavy attackers. If you need to avoid their Attack 
          altogether, use long-range units like Archers, Hunters, or Snipers.
          Illusionists might work too. Just make sure they are protected.

          Enemies:    Mog Knight x3
                      Lamia (Marilis)

          For the first Falgabird, we are engaging against Maralith the Lamia
          in the Roda Volcano area. She also holds three Mog Knights as allies
          so this battle might prove a bit difficult.

          The main difficulty here is not Maralith herself, but rather the
          Mog Knights that back her up. The middle one has Counter, along with
          some Animist abilities. The right one (Right as in the direction 
          right that you're clan should be facing at the beginning) holds some
          Black Magic techniques and Geomancy to boost their power. The left
          one has some Steal techniques including Steal: Weapon which you 
          really want to watch out for.
 
          The one you should target first would definitely be the Mog Knight
          with the Steal: Weapon ability. Therefore, you won't lose any 
          effective weaponry, as that particular Mog Knight seems to enjoy 
          frustrating you by stealing your most valuable weapons. Second, I
          would suggest Maralith herself. The other two Mog Knights may have
          annoying abilities, but Maralith can cast Poison Frog on you, along
          with putting your entire clan to sleep.

          The key here is to Disable Maralith as quickly as possible. If you
          want a longer lasting, yet less effective solution, Blind her 
          instead. Make sure that you don't put your units into lines, or 
          group them together, unless you want to feel the wrath of Chocobo
          Rush or any Black Magic spells. Defeat everyone and win the mission
          along with the Fire Sigil.

          Enemies:    Naga x3

          It's about time we are put up in one of these battles once again.
          Your opponents this time consists of three Lilith which are renamed
          the Naga. In fact, these are actually considerably easier than the
          Lilith. With whatever whatnot, send in six units and start the 
          battle.

          The main advantage here is that each Naga holds only one A-Ability.
          They are Kiss, Poison Frog, and Twister. Normally, a Lilith would
          hold all three abilities, but these Naga only hold one of each. 
          Therefore, taking one out will disable your enemy's abilities to
          use that particular move. 

          With six members, this battle should be fairly easy. The only 
          difficulty you might have would be their high levels. Cut out all 
          three of these Magus Sisters to win the mission, and free Baguba
          Port from Redwing hold.

          Difficulty: Slightly Hard
          Enemies:    Mog Knight x3
                      Ice Flan (Kraken)

          Years ago, a large squid-like monster was supposedly terrorizing the
          sea. Its name was Kraken, which is probably where these guys got 
          the name. First off, a squid in no way, looks at all like an Ice
          Flan, so I can beg the question; what the hell were they thinking?
          Anyhow, bring in your six units and start the battle against the
          Falgabird of wave and water.

          Kraken has three Mog Knights to help back him up. For the most part,
          their Weapon Attack is fairly high. Not only that, but they actually
          carry well-rounded items! Some of it may actually be worth stealing
          to sell later on. Your enemies hold both Charge and Gunmanship. Mog
          Attack damages and pushes units back, Mog Aid heals HP, Mog Lance
          is another long-range attack, and Mog Rush is an all-or-nothing 
          strike similar to the Beatdown ability.
   
          Lucky for you, the Mog Knight's Gunmanship abilities aren't long
          range, and they don't hold Concentrate. In terms of Gunmanship 
          A-Ability, they have the three elemental shots, as well as a few
          status ailmenting shots including, but not limited to; Stopshot,
          Blindshot, Silenshot, Confushot, and Charmshot. Most of the time
          however, they don't use them.

          Kraken himself isn't your ordinary Ice Flan, although he still is
          that easy to destroy with magic spells. If you look at his Defense,
          you will see that it's high up in the 800 area. Only an idiot would
          attempt to bring down its health with regular weapon strikes. If you
          bring in a high-powered Black Mage or some other magic caster, you
          should be able to bring down Kraken in one or two hits. 

          If you want to avoid Kraken's ice techniques, I'd suggest you send
          a powered Thundaga or Firaga strike at him. With Kraken's Magic
          Power, a taste of his Blizzaga can become deadly. Don't let the
          Mog Knights take advantage of you either. This isn't a "defeat the
          boss to win" mission, so if you defeat Kraken, but you lost most of
          your units, you might not win it. 

     #79 Wind Sigil ~

          Enemies:    Mog Knight x3
                      Thundrake (Tiamat)

          If you already completed the other Sigil missions, this one should
          not be as tough. As you already know, the Falgabirds take the form
          of certain monsters throughout FFTA except they hold higher stats
          and more powerful abilities. For the Wind Sigil, we are faced against
          a Thundrake, and believe me, it is no pushover Thundrake.

          Three Mog Knights also populate the enemy force. Bring in six of
          your units to start the battle. Make sure that they are powerful
          enough to take on a heavy-stat monster as Tiamat. The enemy Mog
          Knights will probably pose a threat as well. Regular Charge attacks
          include Mog Attack which pushes units back after damaging them, Mog
          Lance which is a ranged attack, Mog Aid which heals HP, and Mog 
          Rush which deals heavy damage at a low hit rate.

          The Mog Knight's Gunmanship techniques can become increasingly 
          tough to counteract. You have the normal elemental shots along with
          some others. In short, these Mog Knights can possibly Confuse, Charm,
          Stop, Blind, and Silence you. Luckily, they don't hold any ranged
          weapon, and Concentrate isn't with them this time. Also, they don't
          normally use Gunmanship techniques so you won't have to worry too
          much.

          Finally, Tiamat himself can pose quite a threat to your team. With
          a Weapon Attack power in the 270s, he can pose quite a threat with
          his attacks. Not only that, but Tiamat is also capable of unleashing
          Dragon Force which raises all his stats to cause you even more 
          trouble. Bolt Breath is the standard Dragoon ability, and Geomancy
          powers Bolt Breath up even more. 

          You should definitely focus on Tiamat for the most part here. You
          DO NOT want to get hit with a Bolt Breath attack after a few Dragon
          Force ups and Geomancy. The Mog Knights can pose a slight threat 
          with Mog Rush, but if you Blind or simply Disable them, they won't
          hurt you. Defeat every single enemy to beat the great Tiamat Dragoa
          and the Wind Sigil.

          Difficulty: Hard
          Enemies:    Mog Knight x3
                      Zombie (Lich)

          The Earth Sigil is held by a Zombie. Lich de Mort is yet another 
          Falgabird. Three Mog Knights support him as allies. Bring in your
          six units (Holy units are very useful here), and prepare for battle
          and the Earth Sigil.

          You should make sure that your units are capable of taking down the
          three Mog Knights along with Lich as well. Therefore, you shouldn't
          bring in any weak members as you will definitely want the edge in
          battle here. Your three Mog Knights hold the standard Charge 
          abilities which include Mog Aid, a healing move; Mog Rush, a heavy
          damage attack; Mog Attack, which pushes units back one square; and
          Mog Lance, a ranged attack.

          With the addition to that, the Mog Knights not only hold Gunmanship
          techniques, but Stunt abilities as well! This battle differs from the
          last three Sigil battles in this way. While they hadn't held 
          Concentrate before, now they do, and with Mog Rush, they can surely
          bring the pain down. Watch out for their status ailmenting attacks
          and get them down as quickly as possible.

          Lich de Mort himself is just a minor Zombie with some slightly higher
          Weapon Attack power. The fact that he is an Undead creature however 
          gives you both advantages and disadvantages. First off, all Holy 
          moves will deal double damage, or White Mage abilities will hurt 
          instead of heal. However, you might want to leave Lich for last as
          he can also regenerate within three turns. His techniques include
          Drain Touch which steals your HP, Miasma which Poisons, and the
          standard R-Ability, Counter.

          You can attempt to tackle this battle from different directions. 
          For example, Disabling the Mog Knights will keep them at bay. You 
          can also Charm them to hurt each other. If these kind of moves are
          not available to you now, using simple Fight moves swiftly should
          KO them quickly. Therefore, I would suggest bringing in mostly 
          physical units for that. Lich is easily defeated, but I'd suggest
          you wait until all three Mog Knights are gone as he can regenerate
          obviously.

          Enemies:    Defender x2
                      Mog Knight x2
                      Paladin (Glasm)

          Now hold your horses for a moment. I thought that Grissom was a 
          Dark Knight rather than a Paladin. Even stranger, his battle name
          appears to be Glasm rather than Glissom. Whatever, I'm not here to
          question the game, so just bring in some strong units (This battle
          is tough), and prepare yourself for battle.

          Two Mog Knights and two Defenders hold the title as "Glasm's" allies
          here. Seeing as you are fighting the Redwings boss right here, you
          can expect them to be his best elite troops. That is, for the most
          part, true. You have the Mog Knights holding some Charge abilities
          including Mog Attack, Mog Lance, Mog Aid, and Mog Rush. Not only 
          that, but they also hold Stunt and Gunmanship abilities. You would
          want to watch out particularly for Stunt as you can get Stopped,
          Berserked, Confused, and Disabled fairly quickly. And with 
          Concentrate learned, they can only get tougher.

          Although the Mog Knights are tough, the Defenders are even tougher.
          Defend, in itself, is already an ability-type held in high esteem.
          They do hold heavy Attack power, and when that is increased with the
          destructive capabilities of Mow Down, you can expect some pain right
          off the bat. Also, you have some Spellblade Techniques which make
          up the three elemental blades, and the Dragoon elemental breath
          attacks. You might find it best to take out these Defenders as 
          quickly as humanly (Or Viera-ly, or Moogle-ly, or Bangaa-ly, or
          Nu Mou-ly) possible. 

          The real deal here is Glasm himself. What would you expect anyhow?
          He is the Redwings' boss for God's sake! Chivalry abilities consist
          of a healing move, Nurse, the Holy-damage Saint Cross, and the 
          incredibly powerful Holy Blade. Glasm also has a few Aim tricks up
          his sleeve to further show you his power. Weapon Def+ will make it
          even harder than it already is to take him down.

          Units capable of status ailments are a must here. You WILL want to
          Disable or Blind Glasm as quickly as possible. In fact, you can 
          simply Disable or Blind the rest of the group, and focus only on 
          Glasm as he is the "Boss" after all, and the objective is; Defeat the
          "Boss." However powerful his Defense stays with Weapon Def+, he 
          would not be able to survive six units by himself while the rest of
          his team wanders aimlessly around Blinded or Disabled. This is a 
          fun battle, but don't let your guard down.

          Enemies:    Ark Knight (Silverlock)
                      Assassin x2 (Celia, Redy)

          I'll just assume that an Ark Knight is a Clan Borzoi's special
          term for Templar. And geez, they make it sound so cool. Anyhow, 
          we're engaging some more Clan Borzoi scum here in Muscadet. Up 
          against two deadly Assassins and an "Ark Knight," bring in powerful
          units and prepare for battle. Well, it should be three versus six. 
          Give it a bit of thought though. Obviously, these three are a bit 
          on the upper step compared to the normal engagements you might 
          partake in. Nevertheless, a good effort will kick them out of the 
          way. 

          The Assassin on the left is the last one in terms of Weapon Attack.
          However, know that she is the only enemy this time capable of using
          a ranged weapon. Therefore, that Assassin can easily Stop your units
          from a distance with Shadowbind. Even worse, you can easily be KOed
          with Last Breath and Aphonia Silences. Concentrate makes avoiding 
          her moves even more difficult. The way I choose to take her on is 
          through stealing the Master Bow. Therefore, her Weapon Attack goes
          down drastically, and she'll be forced to play hand-to-hand.

          The opposite Assassin has much higher Weapon Attack and a very 
          powerful weapon, the Masamune (I can already hear all you Chrono 
          Trigger players). Nightmare puts units to Sleep and Dooms them.
          Ague Slows down units and Rockseal will Petrify. Along with that,
          she is also fitted with Sharpshoot techniques. Beso Toxico damages
          and Poisons. Death Sickle will inflict Doom status. Prevent her 
          from using the latter move too often. In fact, I'd just suggest you
          Disable her altogether to avoid those terribly annoying moves. 
 
          And finally, we have our "Ark Knight." His line-up consists of 
          standard Templar techniques. There's nothing that you haven't really
          seen already. Beware of Bonecrusher however. If he lands a counter-
          blow on you, that's 1.5x his Weapon Attack. Even worse, with Weapon
          Atk+, he can deal quite a bit of damage. Take him down quickly and
          rid this battle of that monster and Clan Borzoi altogether. Clan
          Borzoi forever! Not.

          Enemies:    Queen Lamia (Queen Lamia)

          The first of the Foreign Fiends is a gigantic Lamia who calls 
          herself the Queen Lamia. I find this name to be a bit over-
          exaggerated as the Queen Lamia herself really isn't anything except
          a high-leveled snake-woman freak. Apart from that, her abilities
          are basically those of a normal Lamia. Pfft.

          Bring in four members. I strongly suggest long-range. Hunters work
          even better because they have techniques that are very anti-monster.
          You might also want to bring in an Archer to Blind or Disable the
          Queen Lamia. Anyhow, this gigantic Lamia's ability line-up consists
          of Night which puts all units to Sleep, Hand Slap which deals damage
          and delays the turn, and Poison Frog which Poisons and of course, 
          turns one of your own into a Frog.

          Night is completely with the Queen Lamia in this case. Because of
          the fact that this is a four-on-one fight, Night can only affect
          your team. Apart from that, you might want to watch out for Poison
          Frog. Beware of the Queen Lamia's high Weapon Attack. That means 
          don't be stupid and trigger her Counter ability every single turn.

          Enemies:    Adamantoise (Adamantoise)

          The second of the Foreign Fiends is a giant Blade Biter going by the
          title of Adamantoise. With exception Weapon Attack and Defense, you
          might have some trouble getting through this one. Be sure you bring
          in a few magic-casting units, as that Weapon Defense is going to be
          hard to crack. 

          The Adamantoise, apart from sounding much more intimidating, is 
          basically the same thing as a Blade Biter. Not only do they have the
          same sprites, but their abilities are the same. Limit Glove is the
          same ol', same ol' critical HP --> 999 HP damage --> ownage. Munch
          gives me a lot of problems as it breaks weapons. When my valuable
          weapons are broken apart, I usually restart the battle. Resonate 
          Disables all physical units. 

          Let's compare Weapon Defense and Magic Resistance. The latter is 
          about 300 points less. Obviously, you should be able to find the
          weakness here. However, most magic-casting units are weak in terms
          of Weapon Defense. If you do send in magic units, make sure that
          they won't be pummeled to pieces. A dead unit is a useless unit.
          Bringing in a White Mage just in case wouldn't be a bad idea.

                      Neochu (Neochu)

          For the last Foreign Fiend fight, you are up against two super-
          Malboros. Yeah yeah, I know what you are thinking (or not). The 
          mission stated very clear there was only one monster. Unless some
          people can't count or the Neochu had an offspring (highly unlikely),
          the mission description is just a mistake on the game's part.

          Anyhow, these two Malboros hold the same ability set-up as their
          respected Malboro or Big Malboro counterparts. The Ochu holds all
          Malboro techniques which include: Goo and Bad Breath. The latter 
          is capable of inflicting a large number of status ailments on you
          at once. I should not be the only one who thinks this is NOT cool.
          The Neochu differs from the Ochu with a few different abiliities.
          Most noticeably, Goo is replaced with Soundwave which Dispels status
          enhancements.

          As you should already know, all Malboro suck in terms of Speed. 
          If you are smart enough to bring in speedy units, the battle 
          advantage is given to you. Not to say that this battle is THAT 
          tough anyway. Watch out for Bad Breath and pound away these two
          creatures to complete this Foreign Fiend mission.

          Enemies:    Dread Lord (Dread Lord)

          Ooh, I like the look and mood of this battle. The old, stone area
          sets the atmospheric effect for the final Foreign Fiend, the Dread
          Lord. Seeing as he is the Lord of the Vampires, you can't possibly
          expect him to be a pushover now? Maybe he is. Bring in four units 
          and begin the battle. 

          The Dread Lord is basically another Vampire. The only noticeable
          difference is the VERY high Weapon Attack. A single strike from the
          Dread Lord will most likely KO most units. Abilities consist of
          LV? S-Flare which deals Dark damage to all units with the same one's
          digits as the Dread Lord. Miasma deals damage and Poisons while 
          Zombify inflicts Zombie status.

          Look at this creature's Weapon Defense and Magic Resistance. This
          should really knock you off your feet. Both values are in the 500s
          meaning that damaging this Dread Lord will not be easy. Therefore,
          you will find that abilities with set damage values like Demi or
          Gil Toss will be very effective. Holy spells from White Mages or
          the Paladin's Holy Blade deal extra damage as well. Expect this
          battle to take a VERY long time.

                      Archademon x2
                      Vampire (Gutskor)

          It's not fair. Gukko, even though he lost terribly, gets to come
          back in a Vampire form with a cool new name, Gutskor. Marche however
          is still his old snobby self despite the fact that he owns the most
          powerful clan in all of Ivalice. Jealousy aside, it's time, once 
          again to push this monstrosity out of Ivalice once, and finally, for
          all.

          Gutskor has on his side, two Apandas and two Archademons. They 
          basically are Ahrimans and Icedrakes with cooler names because they
          are Gutskor's monsters. They have the same sprite, and even better,
          also have the SAME abilities as their lesser monster class. Both 
          Apandas excel in Weapon Attack. Their ability to fly above the rest
          of the group makes it so that surrounding one wouldn't be enough to
          trap them in.

          For the Apandas (Geez, this is getting annoying calling them that), 
          you'd probably know that Roulette is problematic in itself. Once
          casted, a random unit on the map will be KOed automatically. You
          can usually tell when one will use it as the Ahriman (Apanda to 
          remain consistent) will most likely fly to a corner or an isolated
          area. The faster you get rid of that Apanda, the less of a danger
          the battle will pose.

          The two Archademons have incredibly high Weapon Attack. A single
          strike will most likely KO one of your weaker units. Therefore, you
          might find it best to pelt them from far away through ranged 
          attacks. Try not to group your units together as Ice Breath will
          be as annoying as ever. "T"-formations are the worst thing you
          could possibly create. As you already know, Breath attacks damage
          within a "T"-radius.

          Gutskor himself is now a Vampire living the jet-set. If you left him
          for last with a legitimate amount of units still alive, then a few
          strikes should bring him down. Seeing as he's a Vampire, killing him
          off first would be fairly stupid as he revives within three turns
          anything. Of his abilities, watch out especially for Zombify. Holy
          attacks work wonders against him. Likewise, you can easily deal 
          heavy damage with normally beneficial White Magic spells.

          Enemies:    WorldWyrm (Ogma)

          Even after defeating Remedi, you still have many challenges ahead 
          of you. The Worldwyrm is a powerful Thundrake that threatens the
          livelihood of all Ivalice. Currently making a ruckus in his cave
          at Roda Volcano, it is a matter of hours before he begins his 
          rampage. Your clan has been fitted to put him back to sleep. Bring
          in four trustworthy units to go against this powerful monster. This
          isn't your ordinary monster round-up...

          At lvl.46, Ogma the Thundrake is one heck of a Dragon. His Weapon
          Attack and Defense will go through the roof. Judging from his HP,
          cutting away at his health will be a problem just as well. While
          Ogma's regular attacks will generate enough power to KO most units
          within a single strike, Bolt Breath provides a much larger area of
          affect. In fact, if you position all four of units in a "T"-
          formation (of which is a very stupid thing to do), the Worldwyrm 
          can actually blow all of them down with Bolt Breath.

          A good mix of magic and physical strength is required here. Balance
          your units so that if one fails, the other could follow-up and 
          hopefully finish Ogma off. I'd suggest casting Protect or increasing
          Defense before sending a unit off on an offensive against Ogma. 
          A White Mage is very useful for that purpose. As a side note, be
          sure not to use Lightning attacks against Ogma. As a Thundrake, he
          won't be hurt at all.

                      Mog Knight
                      Black Mage

          Well what do you know? It appears as if Montblanc has been tricked
          and rejected. What a surprise (or not). I suppose you could have
          been expecting this drastic change of heart. Montblanc's lover is
          nothing more than a trick. Bring in five units in addition to 
          the now heart-broken Montblanc and begin the battle against these
          trickers.

          A Thief will most likely take the first turn for this battle. As a 
          Thief, you should know to beware his steal techniques. Watch out for
          Steal: Weapon if you are bearing any rare pieces of weaponry you
          woul rather keep. The nearby Juggler is problematic with a few of
          his Stunt techniques. Specifically speaking, Hurl, Ring, Ball and
          Smile. Ring can be annoying as it Stops a unit. Smile, when thrown 
          at an ally, will Quicken.

          The Time Mage and Black Mage can co-exist. The latter can throw 
          very high-powered spells at you. Firaga, Thundaga, and Blizzaga can
          cut HP out very, very fast. The Time Mage can become with Haste and
          Stop. Avoid throwing magic spells at that unit as Return Magic will
          slingshot it right back at you.

                      Gelm Boss
                      Kagle Boss
 
          Well, all leading clans will eventually have some sort of rebellion 
          or uprising occur against them. For this battle, you are up against
          five bosses from various clans that have created a team to fight 
          you. However, with you at the wheel, their futile attempts for 
          control will only fail.

          The Ba Boss plays a role as a Paladin and the pseudo-leader of this
          uprising. As a Paladin, his abilities are obviously powerful. With
          high Weapon Attack, he can become threatening to your group. Holy
          Blade should be avoided obviously. The Hel Boss' job is a Summoner.
          Capable of casting various Summon techniques, she will pose a 
          threat. Remember that Summon magic is capable of hitting units two
          tiles out from center and one diagonally.

          Next in line, the Fes Boss is just inching to get a taste of your
          blade. As a White Mage, you might want to take that unit down before
          he can heal his group. With a White Mage down, your opponents will
          be easier to defeat. The Gelm Boss is a Bangaa that will be sure 
          to prove a problem with heavy Weapon Attack. Earth Render will be
          annoying as it deals damage to all units standing directly in front
          of him. Finally, the Kagle Boss, playing as a Nu Mou Sage will be 
          the main magic-caster. Giga Flare is a high-MP spell that deals 
          incredible damage to a group of units.

          Here's to a cocky Fighter who believes that he can take on the 
          strongest clan in all of Ivalice. With a one on one fight, the 
          Fighter might win, but you are bringing in four of your most trusted
          clan members (I hope). Seriously, how hard can one Fighter be with
          four units to your disposal?

          Sir Fighter here lies at a pretty high level. His Weapon Attack and
          Weapon Defense are incredibly high so you might want to watch out
          whenever he rears up to strike. Air Blast and Backdraft can deal 
          incredible damage if he chooses to use them. Along with that, the
          Fighter can also Immobilize, Disable, and bypass R-Abilities through
          some Aim techniques. Strikeback nullifies incoming Fight moves right
          off the bat so don't even try.

          However, if you look at his stats again, you should notice that 
          Magic Resistance is nearly an entire 100 points below Weapon 
          Defense. If you can possibly bring in some magic units that can
          take his initial punishment, you will be rewarded. Take advantage 
          of the incredibly low (compared to Weapon Defense at least) Magic
          Resistance and blast him away.

          Enemies:    Inverlilith 

          Here, you are up against a special breed of Lamia known as the 
          "Inverlilith." Despite the different name, I don't see too much of a 
          difference between ol' Snake-Lady here and some regulary Lilith. 
          Get four members into the battle, and prepare for a fight.

          Inverlilith here has a few abilities which might cause you some
          problems. Twister is probably one who hadn't seen yet. If you allow
          this creature to get within a few tiles of you, it is capable of 
          using a Twister-attack which knocks off 1/2 of your HP, which when 
          used against a high-HP unit as a Defender, becomes incredibly 
          annoying. Not only that, but she can also Block Arrows, and use 
          Kiss, which Charms and Dooms you.

          If you want to avoid this Inverlilith altogether, I strongly suggest
          you take it out as quickly as possible with high Attack Power. Arrows
          won't work here, but a Gunner wouldn't hurt. The best you can 
          probably do would be to round up a Beastmaster, and attempt to 
          Control it every turn to avoid its powerful attacks.

          as well as Sacrifice, a self KO move to heal another, and Acid,
          a move which inflicts a random status ailment on you. The Ice Flans
          hold Blizzaga obviously, and Sacrifice and Acid as well.

          For the Big Bertha of this Flan clan (Hah, that rhymes), you might
          find it a bit difficult. The Mamaflan is the only Cream on the 
          field with some Magic Power almost reaching 300. Mamaflan here is
          much more versatile with higher Speed (Although not enough to 
          make a difference) and both Sacrifice and Acid. Also, Thundaga can
          hurt quite a bit if you aren't careful.

          There is one thing you can do to fail this mission: bringing in 
          all physical units. Think about it, what are you going to do against
          a bunch of 900-Weapon Defense Flans? With lower Magic Resistance,
          you can easily break them apart with magic. The most practical would
          be the Black Mage in this case. Ice the Mamaflan, Thunder against
          the Jellies, and Fire against the Ice Flans. If you are powerful 
          enough, you should be able to take the Flans out within a single
          strike.

          Difficulty: Easy
          Enemies:    Jawbreaker (Kaikirith)

          Well, here we are engaging a Jawbreaker that someone obviously 
          failed to keep under control. Our mission is easy enough to 
          understand; take down that Jawbreaker. Bring in four units and
          begin the battle. 
          
          As a level 34 Jawbreaker, this summoned monster might be a tough
          cookie to take down. Weapon Attack is in the 450s range. Rather
          than using abilities, this Jawbreaker will prefer to take you 
          down with sheer force rather than trickery. Even so, LV3 Def-less
          will only hurt your chances by taking down the Defense and 
          Resistance of all units with levels divisible by three. Suffocate
          deals damage and delays turn.

          Singlehandedly, this battle might pose a threat. However, with 
          four against one odds, the difficulty is lifted a little bit. Take
          advantage of Kaikirith's lower Magic Resistance and pound its 
          position with high-powered magic spells. Simply sending in strike
          after strike will do well. This is a very easy battle.

          people happen to strangely like to take as pets. Anyhow, he sure
          is one vicious Malboro creature. With 520+ HP, be sure to have some

          a number of status ailments in one casting. Fighting in a Jagd,

          Enemies:    Assassin x2
                      Ninja x3 (Hanzou)

          I guess you had never imagined a clan full of Ninjas and Assassins.
          Obviously, that kind of clan will be one toughie to defeat. The
          Shadow Clan here is a perfect example. The fight takes place in 
          Jagd Ahli to make it even more dangerous. 

          Your enemies consist of three Ninjas including the boss, Hanzou, and
          two Assassins. If you aren't fast enough in taking all five of these
          down, time will run against you. The two Assassins are the main 
          problem as they can use both Sharpshoot and Corner techniques. 
          There are a few moves you want to avoid particularly. Rockseal can
          Petrify units into stone. Shadowbind can Stop units. Nightmare 
          inflicts Sleep and Doom. The most dangerous of them all however,
          is Last Breath. Especially in a Jagd area, Last Breath provides an
          instant KO.

          The Ninjas rely more on physical Weapon Attack than abilities. The
          only non-Double Sword Ninja is the boss himself, Hanzou. However, he 
          can easily make up for that through Turbo MP and Phantasm Skill. The 
          other Ninjas can deal heavy damage through Double Sword which 
          basically enables them to hold two weapons. The one with Blue Magic 
          should be taken down as soon as possible. If you can, Silence both 
          Ninjas to avoid their magic.

          The mission objective is to take down the Shadow Clan boss, Hanzou.
          Defeat him, and the battle is over.

          The Dark Knight is an intimidating figure. WHY WON'T HE SAY 
          ANYTHING! THE SILENCE!

          Anyhow, this Paladin doesn't have a name apart from his title, Dark
          Knight. Obviously, he is a dangerou figure and a silent one at that
          too. At lvl.48, he will most likely cause many problems. Holy Blade
          will deal incredible damage with the high Weapon Attack he bears.
          Weapon Defense statistics go through the roof too. Magic-casters
          will work well off of Dark Knight's weaker Magic Resistance. 
          However, make sure they don't get slain too fast. 

          Defeat the Dark Knight and he will agree to forge you the Dark 
          Blade. Otherwise known as the Ebon Blade.

          holds the ability to forge this next sword.

          Buckles, despite his weird name, is a force to be reckoned with.
          As a Templar, his Weapon Attack goes through the roof and the rest
          of his stats follow closely. Not only will you find out that his
          attacks hurt, but it's hard to hurt him as well. Beware of Lifebreak
          if Buckle's HP is critical. Likewise, beware of Bonecrusher when
          attacking him at close range. 1.5x his Weapon Attack can be quite
          painful.

          Gagat will most likely scare most of your units off with his 
          incredible Weapon Attack. Most Fight moves from him will probably
          KO your units within a single turn. If you fight him at weapon 
          range, prepare to be struck by Counter. Take my advice and do your
          best to avoid attacks at weapon range. Long-range attacks or magic-
          casters are best suited here. His Spellblade Tech allows him to use
          Fire Sword, Bolt Sword, and Ice Sword. 

          Defeat Gagat one way or another and the Fey Blade is yours. The

          Once you locate the group of monsters on the world map, Marche will
          consider letting them go. Now why would you let go these monsters?
          Select Capture, and prepare for an engagement with the group of 
          escaped monsters.

          This is a simple monster battle up against these four. Bring in six
          units and engage. I'd suggest bringing in a Hunter with Capture if
          you actually want any new monsters. If you haven't caught a Coeurl
          yet, now would be a really good time to. The most difficult enemy
          here thus far would be the Coeurl in the back. You will want to 
          avoid Blaster the best you possibly can.

          The Ahriman doesn't pose too much of a threat. Circle might be 
          annoying, but it holds low Attack power so you shouldn't have too
          much trouble with it. The Big Malboro is a whole different story
          however. Bad Breath is one of the most annoying moves in the game,
          as it is capable of inflicting a number of status ailments on you
          at one turn. Finally, the Red Cap can be slightly dangerous, but
          nothing special. 
 
          Defeat all monsters to win. If you want to capture, go ahead and
          use that Hunter. Defeat (or capture) all monsters to win the 
          mission.

          Upon meeting the bandit clan, he will ask you for 3,000 Gil and you
          won't have to engage. If you agree, they won't engage, but you will
          fail the mission. Don't pay the Gil and prepare yourself for a 
          battle.

          This is just like a normal clan engagement. You are up against a 
          clan of six who aren't too tough. Their Black Mage in the rear should
          not be much of a problem as he only knows third-rate Black Magic.
          However, the Warrior, Thief, and the Archer might cause some problems
          against you. You will want to particularly watch out for some of 
          their abilities. The Warrior's Greased Bolt is incredibly annoying,
          and the Archer holds Cupid, a move which inflicts Charm status on 
          your units.

          Target the White Mage first and then begin focusing on the Thief and
          the Archer. Once those three are defeated, take out the Warrior in 
          the back and of course, finish off the Black Mage. If you let this
          battle run too slowly, it will become much harder. Basically, the
          quicker you finish off the more powerful units, the better.

                      Firewyrm x2
                      Thundrake x2

          Find the blue soldier on the map (This is kind of contradictory as
          you are searching for dragons) and run into him. Obviously, seeing
          as dragons aren't very negotiating creatures, you automatically get
          sent into battle without a second thought. Well, I guess it's time 
          to stop these wyrms. 

          In this particular battle, you are facing the wyrms of every
          element (Fire, Ice, Thunder). Therefore, if you are sending in a 
          Black Mage, be sure he is capable of casting all three elements.
          Along with some magic-casters, I would suggest a few physical units
          thrown around in there somewhere to comprehend with the Dragons'
          heavy Weapon Attack. These Dragons aren't easy, so be sure your 
          units are well-leveled and equipped. 

          First things first, the single Icedrake is one of the most difficult
          to defeat of this crowd. With heavy Weapon Attack, you can be sure
          that it can deal quite some damage. In terms of abilities: Mighty
          Guard raises Resistance and Defense, and Ice Breath delivers an icy
          aura. Both Firewyrms hold Guard-Off which throws off the Defense
          and Resistance of one of your units along with Fire Breath which 
          is self-explanatory. Finally, the Thundrakes have Dragon Force which
          increases Attack and Power, along with you guessed it, Bolt Breath.
 
          There really is no secret in terms of defeating these Dragons.
          Both Magic Power and Weapon Attack work fine, but I find it best to 
          mix them together. Just remember that the Icedrake isn't effected
          by Ice attacks, the Firewyrms aren't effected by Fire attacks, and
          the Thundrakes aren't effected by Thunder attacks. Apart from that,
          you can just go crazy.

          for 10,000 Gil. Since it is so much more easier just taking it, 
          select "Just take it." Seeing as we had saved Professor Auggie from 
          trouble two times in a row already, we are to punish his 
          ungratefulness. An act of treason? Nah, we just need the mythril. 
          All aquaintenances aside, bring in six units and engage Auggie's
          team. 

          Auggie's team is evenly mixed between physical and magic. The Viera
          Fencer will most likely pose the least threat to your team. Although
          excelling in Weapon Attack, she fails to deliver a large enough 
          threat. Swallowtail deals damage to all surrounding units, 
          Piercethrough mimics a spear jab extending two tiles ahead, and 
          Nighthawk is a standard ranged attack. Fight moves won't work either
          as Reflex will simply nullify them.

          The other pseudo-physical unit is the Moogle Juggler. For a Juggler,
          he has surprisingly, fairly high Speed stats. As a Juggler, he can
          become a major danger especially with Ring which Stops units right
          in their tracks or Dagger which damages and Disables. Firebomb can
          be threatening against those units that don't rely on Fight moves,
          Ball Confuses on contact, and Smile automatically gives an ally the
          next turn.

          Professor Auggie's right-hand-man is an Illusionist. His Phantasm
          Skill consists of Star Cross which deals Holy damage to all units,
          Stardust which rains meteors on all units, Soil Evidence which deals
          Earth damage to all units, and Wild Tornado which deals Wind damage
          to all units. However, the Illusionist does have a weakness. Because
          of the high cost of MP for each Phantasm Skill, taking out his MP
          should disable him. 

          Auggie himself is a disappointment somewhat. Being the super-Sage
          he should be, his abilities state otherwise. However, that doesn't
          mean that you shouldn't watch out for him. Water and Aero are the
          two standard offensive spells. They shouldn't pose much of a threat.
          Giga Flare on the other hand is much more devastating. Don't group
          your units together or you will fall to a full-powered Giga Flare
          blast.

          Because of the fact that your opponents are evenly mixed in magic
          and physical attacks, dealing with them all at once can be dificult.
          You might find it better to work in steps. For example, casting 
          Reflect on an ally will disable magic spells against that unit. Take
          out the physical units and the Reflected unit will be invincible 
          against magic spells. Defeat all enemies and steal Auggie's mythril.
          Heheh.

                      Thief x2
                      White Monk

          Find those scoop stealers and they will offer to give you an amount
          of Gil if you let them off. Obviously, we'd rather fight than take
          the easy way out, so refuse the deal and begin the battle. Luckily,
          this is going to be easy. 

          We are up against five opponents. Bring in six of your own and 
          start the engagement. You are up against a Fencer, a Warrior, a 
          Soldier, two Thieves, and a White Monk. The first of them, the 
          Viera Fencer has only three abilities. Swallowtail is a radius-
          damage, Piercethrough is basically a Rapier thrusting two tiles
          out like a Spear, and Nighthawk is a ranged attack similar to 
          Mog Lance or Air Render.
 
          The Bangaa White Monk might pose a threat (It wouldn't even be a 
          threat if you know what you're doing). Earth Render damages all 
          enemies lined up directly in front of him, Chakra is a self-heal
          move, Revive brings up his allies obviously, and finally, Holy
          Sign basically Dispels all status enhancements from your allie, so
          don't think you can get through that with your status enhancers. 

          Both Thieves have some standard Steal abilities. You do not want
          them taking any valuable items from you. Luckily, they can't Steal
          abilities nor weapons. Further ahead, you might find a Soldier.
          Luckily, he won't pose any danger whatsoever. His techniques 
          consists of First Aid, Mug, and Provoke. Unless he happens to 
          Berserk your entire team, I doubt you will find him too much of a
          threat. 

          This is an easy battle at this point. Your enemies are lacking in
          abilities obviously. Use whatever stance you'd like and drop all
          enemies to get that scoop back. Well, at least you saved Baguba's
          scoop. Yay...!

                      Malboro x2
                      Mystery Box x2

          Find the blue wanderer on the world map, and run into him to stop
          him. Like so many previous encounters, the Nu Mou will attempt to
          bribe you by offering Chocobo Skin. Because we can take the Chocobo
          Skin along with defeating these smugglers, you should take the 
          "Sorry, no deal" selection. Engage of course.

          Let's see here. What exactly proves to us that the particular 
          Beastmaster that attempted to bribe us before really was smuggling
          some illegal monsters? Well, unless our Nu Mou friend likes to send
          Mexican jumping beans in boxes, you can nearly be sure that those
          crates hold some not-so-legal creatures. And yet, he still claims
          he has nothing. Bring in six units and prepare yourselves for the
          inevitable battle.

          The only two units in this battle you should really take too 
          seriously would be the Beastmaster and the Hunter. The two Malboros
          are easily Disabled or Blinded so you can bypass them for the 
          moment. The Nu Mou of this battle may not hold any A-Abilities
          apart from a few useless Control abilities. His Weapon Attack is 
          in the 300s which is probably higher than your physical units at
          the moment. Just stay far away without letting him get a strike on
          you.

          The Hunter is a whole different story however. His Weapon Attack 
          is very high and can possibly KO your weaker units within a single
          shot. In terms of Hunt abilities, he holds Sonic Boom, an aura
          damaging shot which can easily cripple your units if you happen to
          place them around in large groups. Aim: Vitals inflicts a random
          status ailment, and Addle disallows your unit to use A-Abilities. 
          Obviously, Weapon Atk+ makes this Hunter's arrows even more deadly.
 
          The Malboros play no more than cannon fodder in this battle. Bad
          Breath is an annoying move though. Once its in range, the enemy
          Malboro can use Bad Breath to inflict a number of status ailments
          on you at a time. Although particularly exasperating, it's nothing
          that an Esuna spell or a Cureall can't heal. Along with that, Goo
          can Immobilize you. 

          That pretty much sums it up for the real opponents. If you are
          lucky, the Hunter will be the closest enemy. You should take him
          out before he happens to pick apart your team one by one. The
          Beastmaster, as explained before, holds high Attack Power so you
          might want to use ranged attacks or send units with heavy Weapon
          Defense. Once the threats are destroyed, you can simply demolish
          the boxes to capture this particular smuggling group.

          much, we prefer to get our Antilaw for free. Demand and you will
          engage.

          Eh, this battle shouldn't be much trouble for you. It's six of your
          members against a group of four. Your enemies consist of three 
          physical units along with a Time Mage, who is probably just there
          for kicks. The closest enemy to you as of the start is a Warrior. 
          He has both Warrior abilities, and some Gladiator A-Abilities as 
          well. The Fighter has fairly high attack power, and the Thief knows
          the Ninja A-Ability, Throw.

          Focus on the Time Mage, as it is the easiest to take out. The Warrior
          should also be prioritized. Your opponents here are really pretty 
          easy. Defeat all four, and you can take that Antilaw for free, 
          instead of having to "pay" for your advantage.

          Once you find Ritz, Marche will denote the fact that she seems 
          worried. Then he goes all off-topic about a Blue Rose calming the
          soul. Anyway, if you have a Blue Rose, give it to Ritz for an 
          Allmighty antilaw. Either way, you engage so whatever.

          This mission is easy mainly because you have Ritz's entire clan on
          your side. Your enemies consist of three monsters. The Bomb is a 
          standard-issue monster holding Flame Attack obviously. The Antlion
          is also fairly weak with LV3 Def-less (lowers Defense and Resistance
          of units with levels divisible by 3) and Sandstorm. The Blade Biter
          is the main problem obviously. Even so, it isn't that tough. Munch
          breaks your ally's weapons so beware. Limit Glove deals 999 damage
          when the Blade Biter is critical.
 
          The Antlion and Bomb are easy enough to defeat no matter what you
          throw against them. Like all Rockbeast, the Blade Biter has 
          exceptional Weapon Defense, but it lacks in Magic Resistance. 
          Use high-powered magic spells against it to save Ritz's clan and
          receiving the Beastspear.

          Hmph, poachers huh? Find the walking group along the world map, and
          he'll offer to sell you a skin for 3,000 Gil. Since we don't like
          paying for our stuff, let's start by giving him the cold eye. Prepare
          for a fight.

          Take a look from the start of the battle to learn that every single
          one of your enemies is capable of long-range attack! With that, you
          shouldn't bother with trying to Immobilize a unit as they will be
          able to attack you anyhow. Bring in six units and get the battle
          started.

          Your enemies here consist of two Gunners, two Archers, and two 
          Hunters. The Archers hold a few status ailmenting abilities including
          Aim: Legs which Immobilizes, Aim: Arm which Disables, and Cupid which
          Charms. They also hold Concentrate which greatly increases their 
          accuracy. Therefore, the chances of them landing a Cupid on you are
          pretty high. Both Archers should be prioritized.
 
          Our Gunners are also very dangerous. They hold status ailmenting
          shots just as well and are capable of Confusing, Charming, Blinding,
          and Silencing your units. Like the other Archers, they also hold
          Concentrate which automatically boosts their accuracy up. The Hunters
          have Sonic Boom, a ranged attack with a damage radius, Advice which
          increases an ally's critical hit percentage, and Auto-Regen which
          annoyingly heals their HP every turn.

          As I said, the Gunners and Archers should be taken out first so you
          won't have to deal with their status ailments later. It would be 
          wise to bring in a White Mage capable of healing status as Charm
          can seriously hurt you. Watch out for the Hunter's heavy Attack 
          power, and basically, keep your units alive to defeat these poachers
          and get the Tiger Hide.

          figure on the world map. Find the Snow Fairy, and she'll hit a 
          wave of nostalgia. Choose "No sweets!" and engage.

          You are up against the Snow Fairy along with two of her icy friends.
          Bring in six units. Now wait just a second, did I say six units
          against three weakling monsters? Yes, you will find that this battle
          is very simple indeed. Your Snow Fairy holds only White Wind and 
          Counter while the Grenade has Chill and Blowup. The Ice Flan has
          Acid and Blizzard.

          This mission is a joke. There's no trick here, but to simply defeat
          everyone. Don't forget to use ONLY magic on the Ice Flan. Defeat
          every monster on the battlefield to win this very, very easy 
          mission.

                      Fighter x2 (Weaver)
  
          If you waited until much later in the game to complete this mission,
          this battle will be very easy. Anyhow, Weaver is a vengeful Fighter
          who will stop at nothing to slay the man who was responsible for his
          family's death. Before he turns into a homicidal maniac, we better
          stop him. 

          Weaver's group is well-balanced... sort of. The Archer is the long-
          ranged attacker of this group. Aim: Legs and Aim: Arms are very
          annoying as they are capable of Immobilizing and Disabling you. 
          The Bangaa Gladiator has legitimate Weapon Attack (for a Gladiator)
          along with the three Spellblades. If you have any elemental 
          weaknesses, you'd probably want to avoid Fire Sword, Bolt Sword, or
          Ice Sword.

          The Black Mage can become problematic, but he is easily defeated
          if you chase him. The double-Fighters are very dangerous. Weaver,
          the boss must be defeated to complete the mission. Weapon Atk+ makes
          him dangerous to your group. Weaver is easily stopped if you push
          all effort against him.

                      Archer

          Find the letter-bearer on the world map, and quickly "Grab the Mail."
          The mail deliverers really want to finish their jobs, so you can
          expect they won't just hand it to you. Prepare for an engagement.

          You are up against five enemy units at the moment. For the most part,
          they are generic jobs without any redeeming qualities. You might 
          have some trouble with the Gunner and his Charmshot, Confushot, etc.
          A-Abilities. He also holds Concentrate, but if you can possibly
          Blind him, he will be much easier to avoid. The enemy units hold 
          many abilities, but nothing you haven't seen before. Take out all of
          them and retrieve the mail. Easy. 

     #112 A Challenge ~

          Yo, Clan [Your Clan Name]. You're quite popular lately. There's still
          time for you to join us at Clan Bahan... or else!

          Difficulty: Slightly Hard
          Enemies:    Thief
                      Archer
                      White Mage
                      Black Mage
                      Soldier (Mintz)

          Find the Clan Baham, and they will ask for you to join their clan,
          or face engagement. If you are a girly-man, you probably chose to
          join their clan, which will not only fail you the mission, but change
          your clan title to Baham. Pfft, time to engage.

          This battle is not too hard, but it can cause some trouble. The 
          main problem here is the Soldier, Mintz. Yes, he's the annoying one
          who actually acts as if he has a chance against you. Beware of the
          fact that Mintz has not only the four statistic "Break" attacks, but
          some Fighter techs too. The Black Mage and the Thief should be
          neglected for the most part, as they don't hold anything redeeming 
          or any noticeable abilities. The Archer can become particularly 
          annoying with Aim: Arm, Aim: Leg, and his S-Ability, Concentrate, 
          really can mess you up when comboed with those status ailmenting 
          Aim attacks.  

          Take out the Archer first obviously, followed by the White Mage.
          If Mintz ever gets in your path, take him down as quickly as 
          possible. With the Archer and Mintz down, the battle will be very
          easy. A cakewalk. Defeat all of your enemies and win the mission
          to keep your clan title!

| |=========================================================================| |
| |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 6. Races ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[4000]~| |
|_|=========================================================================|_|

Final Fantasy Tactics Advance is made up of not only human units, but also 
a few others. Each of them have their ups and downs as well as their own 
specialties. The races shall go in the order of the Totemas from the first you
fought to the last. 

Keep in mind that if a job requires abilities from two jobs, the second job
will appear directly beneath the first. 

     =======
     Moogles ~ 
     =======
          Moogles are clever folk who are able to handle any tool with ease. 
          Their curiosity is only matched by their mischievousness. Moogles
          delight in surprising humans, and their jobs highlight their special
          talents. Their dexterity makes them the perfect candidates for jobs
          requiring delicate work. 

          Moogles are a small group full of energy. These cute little creatures
          barely stand more than 3 feet tall. For the most part, you will find
          Moogles holding magical (Black Mage, Time Mage, Animist) or some job
          requiring wit and cleverness (Gunner, Thief, Juggler, Gadgeteer). 
          They don't usually prefer to hold swords (With the exception of the
          Mog Knight however) and survive with their sly minds and quick wit.
          However, their most distinguishing factor is the fact that they, for
          some reason, prefer to add "Kupo" to all their sentences as made 
          obvious by the first Moogle you will ever meet, Montblanc.

          Totema : Famfrit ~
          =--------------=
               The Dark Cloud Famfrit will be the first Totema you face off
               against towards the beginning of the game. When activated, 
               Famfrit will launch crystalized laser bolts which will deal 
               damage to all enemies on the playing field without any chance
               of missing.      

     ======
     Nu Mou ~
     ======
          The Nu Mou are respected by all the races of Ivalice as the most
          adept wielders of magic. They can sense the flow of power and read
          its signs. As Nu Mou do not relish combat, most of their jobs focus
          on the magical arts. 

          Being the wise, magic-wielding, elders of Final Fantasy Tactics 
          Advance, the Nu Mou are a group who rely solely on magic power and
          a connection with nature to survive. They are entirely unviolent
          people, considering violence barbaric and completely unneccesary to
          the ebb and flow of life. For that reason, you will not see any Nu
          Mou wielding swords or spears. Definitely the best of the magic 
          casters.

          Totema : Ultima ~
          =-------------=                                
               The Fallen Angel Ultima is the second Totema you will be 
               acquiring. Unlike Famfrit, Adrammelech, or Mateus, Ultima deals
               MP damage by blasting all enemies with a holy light. 

     ======
     Bangaa ~
     ======
          At a glance, the Bangaa appear to be large, bipedal lizards. Bangaa
          are known for their rough dispositions and their love of battle.
          They are the strongest of the races, and their jobs take advantage
          of this. If you need someone to deal combat damage, look no further.

          Bangaas are pretty much the exact opposite of the Nu Mou tribes. 
          Instead of magic power, Bangaas prefer to let their swords and
          spears do the talking. So without any magical experience (other than
          the Bishop and maybe the Templar), Bangaas do have one good point, 
          all of their jobs are exclusive only to their own race. Also,
          Bangaas are the only tribes allowed to equip spears. Lucky them...

          Possible Jobs ~
          =-----------=
               [Warrior]-----------------------[No Skills Required]
               [Dragoon]---------------------[Warrior A-Ability x2]

          Totema : Adrammelech ~
          =------------------=
               Adrammelech is a Totema with an incredible attack. After 
               defeating this particular Totema towards the middle of game, 
               you will receive his command. Much like Famfrit, Adrammelech
               attacks the entire field with a breath of power hurting all.

     =====
     Viera ~
     =====
          These female hunters are as beautiful as they are proud. Their supple
          limbs are highly agile, and their hearing is so advanced that it is
          said they can talk to the spirit world. Their jobs highlight their
          agility as well as their spiritual adeptness. Only Viera may handle
          summoned monsters. 
    
          The Viera's are a mystical tribe of beautiful female creatures. They
          use spirit magic in conjunction with high level attack power and 
          status ailments. Indeed, the Viera is a spread out tribe with 
          mystical Summoners, deadly Assassins, and sharp-eyed Snipers. Unlike
          the Nu Mou clan which only focus on magic or the Bangaas which only
          focus on swords and spears, you can use both factors. Or even a 
          combination of the two. It's your choice.

          Totema : Exodus ~
          =-------------=
               Exodus the Spectral Tree is another MP draining Totema which
               covers the entire field much like the Nu Mou Totema, Ultima.
               It targets all and cannot miss. 

     =====
     Human ~
     ===== 
          Humans are the most common race in Ivalice. While they have no 
          outstanding natural talent, they are generally good at everything.
          Compared to other races, they have a wide variety of jobs to choose
          from, making them fun to develop.

          I bet you think it's funny that I put Humans in the last slot, huh?
          In my opinion, the Human tribe is the most versatile and well-
          balanced race in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. Why? Not only do 
          they have the most amount of jobs at 11 counting, but the jobs
          are actually pretty good. With magic, holy, swordplay, and archery
          on their side, the Humans are indeed a force to be reckoned with.

For those of you who are unaware of what the abbreviations might mean... 
{HP/MP = health/magic points, Atk = Weapon Attack, Def = Weapon Defense, Pow = 
Power, Res = Magic Resistance, Speed = Self-explanatory...}

Also, a brief introduction to the abilities of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance.
There are four different categories that the abilities are split up into in
this game. Action Abilities are abilities you can use in battle at your 
leisure instead of just your Fight move. They come in many different types with
some being damaging, status affecting, etc. The second type are the Reaction
Abilities. They are used in battle but you cannot use them at your turn. They
can only be activated when the condition surrounding the ability is affected.
For example, the Block Arrows ability blocks all incoming arrows. Therefore,
it can only be effective if an arrow is shot at you (which will miss). Counter
is another Reaction Ability. It's useless except when an enemy attacks you at
weapon range. Then, the clanner will follow up with a counterattack. Support
Abilities are abilities which in some way, helps your clanner indirectly. For
example, it might be the magic-raising Geomancy of the Black Mages or 
Shieldbearer which allows a unit to carry a shield no matter of jobs. And 
last of all, Combo Abilities allow your clanner to use a combo (Ganging Up)
with other clanners (who also have the same ability) against an enemy to deal
heavy damage. All combos require JP. 

In-game, the four abilities will be abbreviated: A-Ability, R-Ability, 
S-Ability, and C-Ability respectively.

You will want to be mastering abilities throughout Final Fantasy Tactics 
Advance. Notice the 100 AP, 200 AP, 300 AP, or maybe even 999 AP next to all 
abilities when you press the L Button over a weapon or rod. When you win a 
battle or complete a dispatch, the screen showing the rewards also has one 
other thing on it, AP. Sometimes, it might be 20 AP, 30 AP, 40 AP, etc. Now,
notice the 100, 200, 300, or 999 AP on the ability. When you gain enough of
those 20, 30, or 40 AP points to to fill the bar on the ability screen to the
maximum, then that ability is mastered. Keep in mind that lower end abilities
require less AP and higher end abilities (like the Ultima attacks or a Ninja's
Doublesword) require 999 AP, the maximum. 

Move is basically the maximum amount of spaces that unit can move straight 
forward, backwards, or the either side. If that unit does not walk straight,
it is the amount of steps that unit can take. Jump is the amount of units a 
clanner can jump. For example, say that Crout, Thief has a Jump stat of 3. As
of now, he is currently on land 3h (The land is 3 units high). He wants to 
jump up to a ledge that's 7h (The land is 7 units high). However, he cannot 
do that as he can only jump 3 units. If the ledge was 6h, he would have made
it. Evade stats is the unit's ability to avoid moves sent at them. A unit with
a higher evade has a less chance of getting hit. All three of these stats 
listed can only be increased through items, not levels. The ones that I will
list are the default without any item, weapon, etc. powerups. These three 
stats differ with different races even if the jobs are the same. 

Stat growth will also be listed, however, after thorough testing, I can 
conclude that level-up stats growth are not fixed, although they usually 
surround an average number. What I did was level up the same job five times
taking each stat growth. With those five values, I added them together and
divided by five to give me the average value. All decimals are rounded up and
any number that appears as zero will be rounded up to one. While the stat 
growth are very helpful in locating stat weaknesses for each job, you shouldn't
pay too much attention to them. Keep in mind that I also have concluded that 
unlike Move, Jump, and Evade, jobs that are found in different races still 
have the same stat growth.

          These energetic Moogle Animists are capable of calling on the help
          of creatures and animals. For the most part, their moves are either
          status ailments or stat uppers for allies or itself, of course.
          Other than their normal "Fight" move, Animists have only one other
          damaging attack which can put them at a disadvantage when one is 
          without the aid of other clan members. The Animist is a good job 
          early on, but as the game progresses, it will become less useful and
          eventually, you might settle for something such as the Mog Knight or
          Gunner (Both require Animist A-Abilities). Also, the lack of any 
          Support ability whatsoever is particularly damaging as well.

          The Mog Knight are the Moogle's most physical attacking unit. A Mog
          Knight's abilities are all unique although many of them are simple
          knockoffs of other physical jobs (ie. Paladins, Gladiators, etc.).
          For example, the Mog Knight's Mog Rush is the same thing as Beatdown
          with different graphic and of course, a different name. Nevertheless,
          Mog Knights are incredible able attackers with amazing growth all-
          around. Not only that but the Mog Knight is one of the most versatile
          fighting units of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance! If you are going for
          a Moogle attacker, the Mog Knight is the definitive choice.

          Gunners, masters of a variety of firearms, hold a position as one of
          the best classes in the game. Armed with extremely long ranged 
          guns, they are capable of knocking enemies out from nearly three 
          quarters across the battle area. At higher levels, their shots do 
          incredible damage and to add to that, many of their shots are status
          effecting. For example, Confushot, Blindshot, Charmshot, et cetera,
          all effect an enemy by not only damaging them but also causing their
          listed status ailment. And when Concentrate is learned, all shots 
          are very accurate causing incredible frustration to your opponents. 
          However, a Gunner has no reaction ability, so get some of those
          abilities from other jobs!

          Thieves are an integral part of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. When
          fully equipped with a state-of-the-art Knife, Thieves play a role as
          incredibly agile attackers. Indeed, they can play a nice role even 
          with their Fight move. However, their most unique aspect is their
          ability to steal... almost anything! Indeed, they are quite useful as
          instead of worrying about your opponent's heavy armor (It would be
          tough to damage), you can just steal it. Same thing with weapons,
          helms, accessories, even entire abilities! Or, you can just get 
          yourself whatever items you need for free as your Thief can just 
          steal it. For the most part, all Steal abilities have a good chance 
          of hitting and when your Thief steals from the rear of most units, 
          it's a 80-90% chance. The only exception is Steal: Ability, 
          naturally which has terrible accuracy. You could guess Square didn't
          want players abusing that move. However, it's easily foiled with 
          Stop or Sleep. Thieves are definitely the unit to have later in the 
          game, as enemies begin to hold much more valuable weaponry and 
          items.

          Jugglers are the tricksters of the Moogle class. They are classified
          as entertainers and have many tricks up their sleeves which they can
          throw upon your enemy. A Juggler isn't a particularly damaging unit
          but they have status ailmenting attacks up their sleeves. Dressed as
          jesters, Jugglers can throw different items to hurt your enemy along
          with creating an entertaining show. Whether you choose to Confuse,
          Berserk, Disable, or even Stop your opponents, the Juggler is the 
          unit to have in your party. Their level gain is nicely done and even
          their physical attacks (Sadly, aren't ranged) cause pretty fair 
          damage. Also, you won't find any Jugger Support Abilities.

          Gadgeteers are a great job to have in any party, but their one major
          weakness is their inability to predict which side, yours or your
          opponents, are affected by their Pandora's Box. Their abilities are
          all status ailmenting or status boosting moves which can turn the
          sides in your favor... or destroy all chances of a win! This would
          usually make you question whether or not to choose one for big 
          battles like the Totemas. Upon using a Pandora, the Gadgeteer will
          flip a coin. The side which the ability will affect is completely 
          random. However, if it does hit your enemy, it's extremely effective.
          There really isn't any way of counteracting the coin from hitting
          your side other than the Fortune Rings, Cacushca's, etc. The lack of
          a Support Ability is particularly hurting as well although the two
          Reaction Abilities are very helpful.

          The Black Mages are the notorious elemental summoners from many  
          previous Final Fantasy titles. In Final Fantasy Tactics Advance,
          they are no exception. With their signature straw hats and dark 
          robes, they are indeed, a force to be reckoned with. They are only
          capable of summoning damaging magic of the three elements, fire,  
          lightning, and ice (also known as water). However, they are not at 
          all capable of sending out status affecting spells or offensive
          spells other than the ones just listed. This might cause some 
          problems which is why it might be best to combine a Black Mage with
          an Animist (Moogle), a Sage or Alchemist (Nu Mou), or a Blue Mage 
          (Human).

          movement, etc. As you can see, Time Mages are fun to annoy the enemy
          with. However, status ailmenting moves aren't the only abilities
          Time Mages are capable of. Both the moves Quarter and Demi suck the
          HP right out of your enemy. No Support Ability, but still, you could
          pass on Geomancy from the Black Mage job to the Time Mage so you

          White Mages are unquestionably the best support unit you can have
          in a clan. However, they are used solely to keep your units in the
          game and basically, keeping everyone in tip-top shape. How do they
          do this? Why, with their great White Magic. White Mages can heal
          with their healing power, cure status ailments, cast barriers on 
          allies, and even give a unit an Auto-Life! However, they aren't that
          great of attackers, just for the mere support of the rest of your
          clan. Be sure to keep your White Mage out of enemy range and use it
          to your greatest advantage. There is one instance in which a White
          Mage would be an effective attacker and that would be against the
          Undead (Zombies and Vampires). Use the Holy Cure/Cura/Curaga moves
          against them and watch them fall. Beware, no Reaction Ability!

          The Black Mages are the notorious elemental summoners from many  
          previous Final Fantasy titles. In Final Fantasy Tactics Advance,
          they are no exception. With their signature straw hats and dark 
          robes, they are indeed, a force to be reckoned with. They are only
          capable of summoning damaging magic of the three elements, fire,  
          lightning, and ice (also known as water). However, they are not at 
          all capable of sending out status affecting spells or offensive
          spells other than the ones just listed. This might cause some 
          problems which is why it might be best to combine a Black Mage with
          an Animist (Moogle), a Sage or Alchemist (Nu Mou), or a Blue Mage 
          (Human).

          Time Mages are masters of time and space (as their job title states).
          Uniformed in bright red and blue colors, Time Mages actually use the
          force of time in their magic. For the most part, they Slow down 
          enemies, Stop targets in their tracks, casts Haste to speed up 
          movement, etc. As you can see, Time Mages are fun to annoy the enemy
          with. However, status ailmenting moves aren't the only abilities
          Time Mages are capable of. Both the moves Quarter and Demi suck the
          HP right out of your enemy. No Support Ability, but still, you could
          pass on Geomancy from the Black Mage job to the Time Mage so you 
          have no reason to complain. Hah!

     Illusionist (Phantasm Skill) ~

          With Phantasm Skills on their sides, Illusionists are capable of 
          dealing light or medium damage to all enemies on the field... in 
          about eight different ways! How is that possible you might ask? Well,
          with each ability being a different element, I suppose you have just
          been answered. Now, you might find this a bit cheap, but an attack on
          the entire field, how is that possible? It would be just like a 
          no JP Totema if not for two key differences, Phantasm can miss, and
          every enemy on the playing field is dealth only light damage unlike
          Totemas which deal incredible damage with every casting. Despite 
          those, Illusionists still play as an incredibly useful job. Because
          of the fact that each move can hit no matter what, you don't need to
          send an Illusionist directly into battle, which really helps 
          coinsidering HP and Def. growth. Critical HP enemies can be finished 
          off in a snap and your Illusionist will never have a free turn as 
          long as there are enemies. When the time comes, it is well worth it
          to invest in an Illusionist.

          In ancient times, Alchemists were the ones who attempted to turn
          base metals in gold! Indeed, the study of Alchemy was incredibly
          short-lived, however, Final Fantasy Tactic Advance's Alchemists are 
          an incredibly powerful Nu Mou class holding the position as one of 
          the best magic units in the game! Their magic spells are incredibly 
          powerful and can easily turn the tide of battle in your favor. 
          Unlike the Black Mage which only deals offensive damage or the White
          Mage which only deals support, the Alchemist is capable of 
          incredibly powerful offense spells as well as the Templar's Astra, 
          which nullifies the first status ailment that affects one of your 
          allies. Some moves deal crazy damage or even instant KO! With an 
          Alchemist on the field, you simply can't go wrong. But, the lack of 
          a Reaction Ability is incredibly hurting to such a powerful job.

          The Beastmaster is a unique Nu Mou job. As it's name clues, 
          Beastmasters are masters of, well, beasts... Using instruments to 
          control different monsters, Beastmasters can easily turn the tide of
          battle, but only in a battle with monsters. When you gain control of
          a monster, you get to control it for one turn. However, this job can
          control monsters and ONLY monsters. Therefore, when placed in a 
          regular clan battle without engaging monsters, Beastmasters are 
          useless which brings down their approval rating quite a bit. For the
          most part, many people use these Beastmasters to force monsters to 
          use their abilities on Blue Mages which is pretty much, their most
          practical use. Nevertheless, Beastmasters shine with amazing status
          growth (attack and defense growth is amazing considering that this is
          a Nu Mou) and are one of a kind.

          Have you wondered what the Monster Bank is for? While it may seem 
          useless around the beginning of the game, it will grow in importance.
          Its only use is to fuel the Nu Mou Morpher's attack power. To add a 
          monster, you need to capture it with the Hunter's A-Ability, Capture.
          When captured, it will be sent to the Monster Bank and you will
          collect a Soul with the name of that particular monster. These Souls
          can be used by a Morpher which then morphs into the monster of the
          Soul. At that point, the Morpher can use any abilities that the 
          monster can use! While a Morpher may be an annoying job to use as
          you will have to constantly keep your monsters happy, and you have
          to work to gain Souls, when fully powered up, may be the greatest
          Nu Mou class. However, that only depends on your diligency and desire
          to make your Morpher the best. Keep in mind that Morpher's don't hold
          any Support Abilities. That is only a minor disadvantage however.

     Sage (Sagacity Skill) ~

          Sages are an incredibly powerful Nu-Mou class and the most versatile
          out of all magic classes (Except for maybe the Blue Mage/Morpher) 
          whatsoever! The most unique ability that a Sage could hold would be 
          the Giga Flare, one of the most powerful abilities in the game if 
          not already the one! Apart from Giga Flare, you will find Ultima 
          magic just as well. Ultima Blow is an incredibly powerful strike 
          with a heavy MP cost (Which is definitely well worth it). Other than 
          those offense magic spells, Sages also holds the ability Raise, 
          which is quite possibly the best healing move. Why? It can revive 
          any units within the aura radius and all units which are not KOed 
          get a healing. When powered up and kicking with amazing stat growth, 
          they will provide a heavy burden on any opponent.

          Ezel Berbier should really stick to selling Law Cards and selling
          Law Cards only! The Hermetic has to be the worst job out of all. 
          Ezel holds only two abilities, Azoth which puts all enemies to 
          sleep and Astra which is self-explanatory. While HP and Attack growth
          are surprising considering that Ezel is a magic-caster, he still 
          doesn't see the light. Reaction and Support Abilities are okay, but
          the fact that you absolutely cannot help this poor soul by teaching
          him new abilities simply wipes out all possible usage. Don't use 
          Ezel. A waste of space.

          As most of you might already be aware, Babus may join your clan upon
          completion of the game. Babus is a Runeseeker, an unique job that
          can only be mastered by Babus himself. A Runeseekr has decent MP 
          growth but incredible Magic Power growth. Babus's starting abilities
          are pretty good. Explode is similar to the Alchemist's Flare except
          with Fire elemental. Stillness simply Stops a unit. Quarter and Demi
          are rip-offs from the Time Mage and Counter and Weapon Def+ are 
          self-explanatory. However, because of the fact that you can't master
          any further abilities, Babus isn't too great of a choice. Anyhow,
          at least the Runeseeker lords over Ezel, the Hermetic by a longshot.

          Warriors are the sword-wielding tanks of the Bangaa class. Equipped
          with Swords, Broadswords, and heavy armor, they pack quite a punch in
          one. With great overall physical status gain, they can get powerful
          pretty quickly and it isn't surprising to see a Warrior with 
          outrageous HP compared to the rest of its clan. Nevertheless, while 
          Warriors serve well as attackers, they are easily overshadowed by the
          better physical units. While I consider Warriors to be better than 
          their Human counterpart, the Soldier, they still aren't effective in
          battle for anything else other than their powerful blows. While the
          majority of a Warrior's abilities are "break" attacks, it does hold
          some interesting abilities. Greased Bolt, for example, is one of the
          few moves that actually can bypass an R-Ability and Downsize is an 
          incredibly useful move. Nevertheless, Warriors, when put up against
          a greater job, serve only as cannon fodder. But very powerful cannon
          fodder!

     Dragoon (Dragon Tech) ~
     =====================
          [Warrior A-Ability x2]

          Dragoons are quite possibly the best physical units in the game in 
          similar league to the Human Paladins or Fighters. As you might 
          already know, Dragoons are Wyrm-killers. With that, they are one of
          two races (Both Bangaa) that can equip the Spear which extends two
          units unlike the normal range of one. Therefore, Dragoons can hit two
          different targets at one point. However, this can draw up some 
          disadvantages. For example, you may intend to hit an enemy in front 
          of you, but one of your allies is stuck in front of your target. If 
          you strike your enemy, your ally will also be hit (Unless he happens
          to dodge it). Anyhow, Dragoons are incredibly powerful units capable
          of incredible destruction. The three "Breath" attacks are an extreme
          asset to any Dragoon's ability lineup and Wyrmkiller doubles damage
          against any Dragon monster. With a high Attack growth and powerful 
          abilities, you have no reason to not have a Dragoon with the rest of
          your clan.

     Defender (Defend) ~

          Defenders are attackers with an ethic of defense. With incredible
          HP and Defense growth, Defenders are very able at what their job
          titles depict, Defense. The Bangaa Defender, in many ways, is similar
          to the human Paladin. Both have high HP and Defense growth (even
          though Defender's have better growth, the Paladin is a more capable
          attacker with better abilities), thus, making both incredibly 
          difficult to get rid of. A lot of a Defender's abilities consists of
          defending itself. For example, Defense makes a Defender cast Shell 
          and protect on itself, Aura casts Auto-Regen and Auto-Life on self,
          and Expert Guard nullifies all HP or MP damage for a single turn. 
          These abilities, when mastered, become a frequent annoyance. This
          advantage especially sees the light when your Defender becomes the
          last unit on the field. It is very easy to constantly cast Auto-Life
          on yourself and Expert Guard annoys your opponent even more. One
          of the best combos can also be executed through the Defender. Cast
          Aura on self and use Meltdown while still at full health. Auto-Life
          brings you back to the living and at the same time, the unit that
          was next to you is probably lying on the ground. The Bangaa unit, 
          Defender, is not required, but becomes a useful character as you
          master its abilities.

          The Bangaa Gladiator (Much better than the Fighter) are well known 
          for their Ultima Sword attack, however, they are also known for 
          their magical "Spellswords" capable of dealing elemental damage at 
          the cost of some slight MP. The rest of a Gladiator's abilities are 
          mostly from the Fighter class. I'm sure that you might recognize 
          Rush, Beatdown, etc. Also, Gladiators hold another skill which 
          Fighter's lack. With Ultima magic, they can pull off Ultima Sword, a 
          powerful strike. The disadvantage to this however is the MP cost. At 
          60 MP per strike, your Gladiator probably doesn't have the MP (Just 
          look at its MP growth) for more than a few execution. Nevertheless, 
          Gladiators are effective in their job and play a good role as 
          physical units.

          As you all might already be aware of, Bangaas are a naturally 
          fighting race. White Monks, unlike Warriors, use their fists rather
          than a Sword or Blade. Because of that, Knuckles that fit on hands
          are most useful. While a White Monk is a good choice for an attacker,
          you will also have the option of many other abilities too. Instead of
          just the simple sword strikes of the Warrior, a White Monk can learn
          a number of ranged attacks (which do quite a bit of damage to) as 
          well as capable of holding many reviving or healing abilities. One
          ability can even destroy Undead creatures instantly. I find White
          Monks to be a large step above their sword-slinging brothers and the
          best part about them; they don't require any skill prerequisites.

          Bishops are basically, the only Staff-wielding class that the Bangaa
          race has to offer. Because the Bangaas are natural fighters, Bishops
          aren't the best of the magic casters. Nevertheless, when their 
          abilities are used properly, they can still pack a punch. Because 
          Bishops are the only Rod-wielders, their abilities range from Cura,
          the run-of-the-mill curing ability that you see on the White Mage to
          the Sage's Water and Aero that deal Water elemental and Wind 
          elemental. However, their only Petrifying ability, Break, is somewhat
          advantageous as it only requires 200 AP unlike some other abilities
          with the same affect; the Assassin's Rockseal for example. Other than
          that, Bishops are simply mediocre magic casters. There are so many
          better jobs but if you want a go, by all means, take the Bishop.

          Temple Knights are basically Spear/Sword wielding "mage killers." 
          Yes, that seems to be their main goal. With their collection of MP 
          hurting attacks and Silence, they sure to seem to achieve that title 
          pretty well. Along with that, Templars still stand as stellar 
          attackers and rushers with their more than average Attack and 
          Defense growth.  Along with their anti-magic abilities, Templars 
          also hold many status effecting abilities along with being capable 
          of casting Astra, a unique move which nullifies the first status 
          ailment that affects the one that the Templar casted Astra on. I 
          consider Templar's to be the better of the two jobs cast down from 
          the White Monk as Bangaa were never meant to be die-hard magic 
          wielders.

          Fast and incredible evasive, Fencers play a role as the Viera's main
          assault job. Armed with Rapiers, they stab at their opponents to 
          bring them down. While Fencer's do play a great role of bringing
          down enemies with sheer force and attack power, they don't play a 
          role in any magic-casting. Nevertheless, they hold some pretty 
          effective abilities and are better than the Soldiers or Warriors.
          With great Speed growth and a high Evade to boot, Fencers are
          well-rounded as a physical unit.

          Elementalists are said to be able to communicate with the spirits of
          past forces to generate magic spells of the different elements. 
          This Viera magic unit plays a different role than most offensive 
          magic casters. In fact, most of the Elementalist's magic abilities
          are similar to the Ninja's elemental "Veils." They are similar in the
          fact that Elementalist's magic spells aren't the most powerful, but
          they also inflict status ailments more often than not. With offensive
          magic that also bombards your enemy with status effects, these
          Elementalists can also heal your units with Earth Heal and White
          Flame. When Spirit Magic is used effectively, Elementalists can add
          to your advantage greatly.

          A Red Mage is like the Viera version of what might happen if you 
          chose to fuse a Black Mage, an Alchemist, a White Mage, and a Bishop
          into one. A Red Mage is an incredibly spread job capable of both 
          offensive magic, and helping out your team by casting Barrier or
          healing with Cure. However, a Red Mage's usefulness doesn't end
          there, as it can even go as far as casting two spells at once with
          Doublecast, an unique ability which allows two casts in one turn. 
          When Magic Power (Which grows fairly well for the Red Mage) is up
          high, two rounds of Fire, Thunder, or Blizzard can easily snuff out
          an enemy unit without breaking a sweat.

          Summoners may be powerful magic casters... but they have the worst
          stats out of all the Vieras! With less than average Evade stats and
          terrible Speed, Weapon Attack, and HP growth, Summoners are easily
          snuffed out. Therefore, it would be practical to level a Summoner up
          as something else (Elementalist for example) while learning the 
          abilities. However, nearly all effective magic-casting units take 
          horrible stat growth, so you should find some way to get over it.
          Summoners are known to cast spells of large area effect. Therefore,
          you can easily hit 10+ units with a single strike. Because of a 
          Summoner's incredibly high Magic Power growth (That seems to be the
          only stat that a Summoner excels with), you can easily take out an
          enemy clan with one high-powered strike of magic. Along with 
          offensive spells, Summoners also hold healing spells or non-offensive
          magic.

          Deadly and sly, Assassins do just as their job title states. Apart
          from Ninjas, Assassins wield deadly Katanas to quickly slash through
          enemies quickly and Greatbows to take out targets from range. This
          Viera class, the Assassin, is definitely one of the most difficult
          jobs to pick up. For one thing, you need two Elementalist A-Abilities
          and a single Sniper A-Ability. However, unless you automatically 
          recruit either an Elementalist or Sniper, you will need to get 
          yourself both (Elementalist; White Mage, Fencer A-Abilities and for
          Sniper; 2 Archer A-Abilities.) While Assassins are difficult to 
          collect, they are also very versatile with the fact that they can
          equip either a long range weapon or a sharp blade for hand-to-hand
          combat. An Assassin doesn't just strike away to win. This class uses
          abilities to cut the foe weak. Shadowbind to Stop, following with a 
          Nightmare to put to Sleep. With that, you can finish off with the
          powerful Ultima Masher. The Viera Assassin is indeed, a powerful 
          unit.

          Archers are the standard bow-wielders you probably will be using 
          early in the game. With the bow, their attack power isn't too bad
          and if you are diligent with the leveling up, you can get some 
          pretty high attack power. An Archer's abilities aren't too shabby
          either. They are capable of many status-ailmenting strikes. The most
          noticeable will probably be the incredibly cheap Support Ability,  
          Concentrate. With this ability in your deadly arsenal, even Cupid 
          attacks from the front of even high-evade units like Fencers will
          have accuracy up in the 80-90% range. Concentrate is definitely the
          ability to master and carry on to the Sniper (Viera) or Hunter 
          (Human) jobsets.

          Snipers are Greatbow wielders, but they cannot be compared to jobs
          as Archers or Hunters. Instead, they are more stealthily built with
          more deadlier abilities. While Archers are more on the status 
          altering side, Snipers play a role as a quick killer (Can very well
          be compared to an Assassin). Therefore, they hold moves like Death
          Sickle or Doom Archer or the unique move, Conceal, which makes you
          disappear so that you can sneak up behind enemy units for a killing
          shot. While many prefer the Archer over the Sniper, I still use this
          job mainly for abilities which cannot be found on other long-range 
          units. When applied correctly, Snipers are deadly adversaries. Beware
          the lack of a Support Ability.

          White Mages are unquestionably the best support unit you can have
          in a clan. However, they are used solely to keep your units in the
          game and basically, keeping everyone in tip-top shape. How do they
          do this? Why, with their great White Magic. White Mages can heal
          with their healing power, cure status ailments, cast Barriers on 
          allies, and even give a unit an Auto-Life! However, they aren't that
          great of attackers, just for the mere support of the rest of your
          clan. Be sure to keep your White Mage out of enemy range and use it
          to your greatest advantage. There is one instance in which a White
          Mage would be an effective attacker and that would be against the
          Undead (Zombies and Vampires). Use the Holy Cure/Cura/Curaga moves
          against them and watch them fall. Beware, no Reaction Ability!

          Soldiers are the human versions of the Bangaa Warriors. They both 
          serve as 2nd class jobs (a Soldier upgrades to a Paladin or a 
          Fighter) and both have similar abilities. However, due to that 
          similarity, a Soldier cannot hold any particularly valuable ability 
          and towards the midpoint of the game, you might rule out your 
          Soldiers altogether to make room for Fighters, Paladins, or Ninjas. 
          I suppose the two Support abilities are supposed to make up for the 
          lack of a Reaction ability, although it would be nice if a Soldier 
          had something unique with it. Nevertheless, a Soldier is still a 
          solid attacker and can take quite some punishment before going down,
          but when you put a Soldier up against something like a Fighter 
          (with the same levels and stats of course), you can already predict 
          who the winner of that fight will be.

          Paladins are incredible attackers and very deep believers in the 
          forces of Holy. Especially in the higher levels, attacks from 
          Paladins can deal 200+ HP damage with just a single strike from a 
          sword. And when equipped with a powerful Knightsword as Excalibur2,
          they can deal well over that. And when Holy Blade is learned, you can
          expect your Paladin to deal well over 500 HP damage with each swing
          against a same-level unit. The HP damage is even higher against 
          Undead monsters. Along with a Paladin's extreme attack power, they 
          also have a very high defense. In fact, you can actually get a 
          Paladin to take damage for a weaker unit like a Black Mage with 
          Cover. These knights are also capable of healing allies and actually
          make an enemy leave the battlefield. Paladins are truly a force to 
          be reckoned with.

          Being powerful, versatile, and rugged, Fighters are the definitive
          fighting unit, hands down. However, because they are Fighters after
          all, they don't hold any redeeming qualities other than their 
          impeccable ability to defeat enemies with incredibly damaging melee
          strikes. Their effectiveness doesn't end at the bottom of their
          Blade however, as a Fighter also holds many abilities. Now, you may
          think to yourself; how many differnt ways can you hit someone with a  
          Blade? Take a look at the abilities chart. As you can see, a Fighter
          has many, many ways to quickly put the smack-down on any enemy unit
          with use of his abilities.

          Thieves are an integral part of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. When
          fully equipped with a state-of-the-art Knife, Thieves play a role as
          incredibly agile attackers. Indeed, they can play a nice role even 
          with their Fight move. However, their most unique aspect is their
          ability to steal... almost anything! Indeed, they are quite useful as
          instead of worrying about your opponent's heavy armor (It would be
          tough to damage), you can just steal it. Same thing with weapons,
          helms, accessories, even entire abilities! Or, you can just get 
          yourself whatever items you need for free as your Thief can just 
          steal it. For the most part, all Steal abilities have a good chance 
          of hitting and when your Thief steals from the rear of most units, 
          it's a 80-90% chance. The only exception is Steal: Ability, 
          naturally which has terrible accuracy. You could guess Square didn't
          want players abusing that move. However, it's easily foiled with 
          Stop or Sleep. Thieves are definitely the unit to have later in the 
          game, as enemies begin to hold much more valuable weaponry and 
          items.

          People seem to go crazy over the Ninja. For the most part, I agree
          wholly. For one thing, Ninjas are swift, speedy, and very evasive
          units with high attack power. With that, they are automatically 
          qualified as one of the best Human units seeing as the other physical
          (Apart from the Thief obviously) units are slow and tank-like. Ninjas
          hold some very unique abilities, including the five "Veils." These
          are solely elemental magic blasts which are similar to the Viera job,
          the Elementalist. The "Veils" not only deal light damage, but they
          also are to inflict a random status ailment. A Ninja's best ability,
          however, is not an A-Ability. Rather, it is a Support Ability known
          as Double Sword. As soon as that ability is mastered, all strikes 
          from your Ninja does double damage, because of the fact that you are
          carrying a weapon in each hand!

          White Mages are unquestionably the best support unit you can have
          in a clan. However, they are used solely to keep your units in the
          game and basically, keeping everyone in tip-top shape. How do they
          do this? Why, with their great White Magic. White Mages can heal
          with their healing power, cure status ailments, cast barriers on 
          allies, and even give a unit an Auto-Life! However, they aren't that
          great of attackers, just for the mere support of the rest of your
          clan. Be sure to keep your White Mage out of enemy range and use it
          to your greatest advantage. There is one instance in which a White
          Mage would be an effective attacker and that would be against the
          Undead (Zombies and Vampires). Use the Holy Cure/Cura/Curaga moves
          against them and watch them fall. Beware, no Reaction Ability!

          The Black Mages are the notorious elemental summoners from many  
          previous Final Fantasy titles. In Final Fantasy Tactics Advance,
          they are no exception. With their signature straw hats and dark 
          robes, they are indeed, a force to be reckoned with. They are only
          capable of summoning damaging magic of the three elements, fire,  
          lightning, and ice (also known as water). However, they are not at 
          all capable of sending out status affecting spells or offensive
          spells other than the ones just listed. This might cause some 
          problems which is why it might be best to combine a Black Mage with
          an Animist (Moogle), a Sage or Alchemist (Nu Mou), or a Blue Mage 
          (Human).

          With Phantasm Skills on their sides, Illusionists are capable of 
          dealing light or medium damage to all enemies on the field... in 
          about eight different ways! How is that possible you might ask? Well,
          with each ability being a different element, I suppose you have just
          been answered. Now, you might find this a bit cheap, but an attack on
          the entire field, how is that possible? It would be just like a 
          no JP Totema if not for two key differences, Phantasm can miss, and
          every enemy on the playing field is dealth only light damage unlike
          Totemas which deal incredible damage with every casting. Despite 
          those, Illusionists still play as an incredibly useful job. Because
          of the fact that each move can hit no matter what, you don't need to
          send an Illusionist directly into battle, which really helps 
          coinsidering HP and Def. growth. Critical HP enemies can be finished 
          off in a snap and your Illusionist will never have a free turn as 
          long as there are enemies. When the time comes, it is well worth it
          to invest in an Illusionist.

          Apart from Morphers, Blue Mages are possibly the most versatile magic
          casting unit in all of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance! Anyhow, Blue
          Mages are a magic casting unit being the only ones that uses Sabers.
          With the S-Ability, Learning, equipped, Blue Mages can automatically
          learn most monster abilities just by getting struck by one! With  
          balanced Attack and Defense growth, Blue Mages can also be used as
          very effective physical units for up-front strikes. Every ability 
          that a Blue Mage learns requires some number of MP which is sometimes
          a downside, however, Blue Mages also have stellar MP growth. Much
          like the Nu Mou Morpher, getting yourself a well-balanced and 
          powerful Blue Mage is difficult. In fact, to learn some of the 
          greater abilities, you actually need a Beastmaster to aid! For 
          example, learning a Sprite's White Wind is no easy matter. After all,
          why would a Sprite want to heal your Blue Mage? The key to receiving
          this ability is simple; the Beastmaster. However, once your Blue 
          Mage learns the higher end abilities, battles become much easier.

          Archers are the standard bow-wielders you probably will be using 
          early in the game. With the bow, their Attack power isn't too bad
          and if you are diligent with the leveling up, you can get some 
          pretty high attack power. An Archer's abilities aren't too shabby
          either. They are capable of many status-ailmenting strikes. The most
          noticeable will probably be the incredibly cheap Support Ability,  
          Concentrate. With this ability in your deadly arsenal, even Cupid 
          attacks from the front of even high-evade units like Fencers will
          have accuracy up in the 80-90% range. Concentrate is definitely the
          ability to master and carry on to the Sniper (Viera) or Hunter 
          (Human) jobsets.

          Hunters, when paired up with an Archer's set of abilities, easily
          becomes one of the best classes in the game. Apart from their ability
          in battle, Hunter's are most well-known for their Capture ability
          which sends any captured monster to the Monster Bank (Read the 
          section for more information). That makes Hunters the only job 
          capable of that. Along with capturing monsters, Hunters also have a 
          nice set of abilities which are somewhat themed around monsters. How
          so? Well, for starters; Capture sends monsters to the Monster Bank 
          obviously, Sidewinder is another which causes heavy damage to any
          targetted, and Oust works like Parley, "persuading" monsters to 
          leave the field. Even more, Hunter's have the Ultima ability, Ultima
          Shot for heavy damage at a heavy price of MP and the simple, yet
          practical, Sonic Boom ability. Hunters are an incredibly dangerous
          adversary when paired up with its cousin job's abilities, the Archer.

     Judgemaster (Advanced Law) ~

          MP: +4       Def: +6        Res: +8

          Judgemaster Cid has to be most difficult character to join your clan.
          Why? Because you need to complete all 300 missions in order to 
          actually get a chance. Anyhow, Cid is definitely the best of the
          secret characters. Really the only one you should actually keep in 
          your clan! He has nice attack power, but his abilities are what 
          shines. All of them either have to deal with JP or nullifying laws.
          Incredible asset to any clan and well worth it for defeating all 
          300 missions.

your clan title changes as you progress through the game and accomplish

am not completely sure of each.

| |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 9. Laws and Imprisonment ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[9000]~| |
|_|=========================================================================|_|

A major portion of the battle system are the laws... and the punishments for 
ignoring them. 

At first, there will be a single law which wouldn't lock too much of your 
party. However, as you progress through the game, the laws change from one a 
day, to two a day, and eventually, to three a day which can be an annoyance.

If you happen to break the law, there are two consequences. You will receive
either a Yellow Card, or a Red Card. A Yellow Card is received if you execute
a move that the day bans without KOing any of your opponents. A Yellow Card is
minor and won't do anything other than the punishment for that law. A Red Card
can only be achieved if you break a law and receive two Yellow Cards, or if you
faint an opponent by breaking a law. A Red Card is much more serious and will
not only give you the punishment for that law but also send you to the jail! 
When that happens, you will need to head to the Sprohm Prison facility and pay
to bail out your clan member.

Laws can be counteracted however. Upon defeating Mission #6 Antilaws, you will
have the ability to use Law Cards. Law Cards come in two different varieties.
The white colored cards add the Law which they are named for and the black
colored are capable of nullifying Laws so you won't have the trouble of the 
Laws for that day. If you note the Laws, you will notice that they are ranked 
from R1 to R6. The only thing these ranks are useful for are the Antilaws! 
These are capable of clearing every Law for that day depending on their rank.
Here is a list of all obtainable Antilaws:

      1. R1 Antilaw - Nullifies all R1 Laws.
      2. R2 Antilaw - Nullifies all R2 Laws. 
      3. R3 Antilaw - Nullifies all R3 Laws.
      4. R4 Antilaw - Nullifies all R4 Laws.
      5. R5 Antilaw - Nullifies all R5 Laws.
      6. R6 Antilaw - Nullifies all R6 Laws. 
      7. Almighty - Nullifies all Laws. 

How do you receive these Antilaws and the rest of the Law Cards you ask? Well,
for one thing, you can always receive them as rewards from missions or 
engagements, but if you really need a card, you better check at Ezel's Law
Shop at Cadoan. There, you can trade your current Law Cards for better. Each
Law Card has a value, and when added up, can be traded for another more 
effective card. The values of each card constantly changes so check back 
often.

Breaking the Laws can put you up for different forms of punishment. You can be
charged by not receiving the Gil for the engagement or mission, lose an item,
receive status down (which can be particularly hurting) which removes some 
points from a random stat, etc. The more Red and Yellow Cards you have, the
more hurting the punishment shall become. For example, your first Yellow 
Card might bring down your Attack Power by 2, but with ten yellow cards, it 
can bring it down by values of 20 or 30. 

To clear your entire record of all collected Red or Yellow Cards, you will need
to head to Sprohm. Talk to the jailkeeper and ask for a Pardon. You will be 
forced to imprison the unit you would like to clear for two battles as well
as paying a Gil fine for the Pardon. Come back and pick up your party member
and the record for that single member will be cleared. 

The judges of Ivalice and the Laws are everywhere... except for the Jagds. 
You probably won't be seeing one until later in the game, when you meet 
Montblanc's little brother, Nono. Jagds are areas where the judges avoid. 
Because of that, Law's don't exist there. However, a lawless landscape holds
great consequences. Without the judges to stop death, if you lose one of your
members, they are gone for good. That's why I choose to stay clear of the Jagds
unless forced into them through a mission or similar.

               * Special Note: The Sequence is a unique Knightsword. You win
                               it in Mission #40 Battle Tourney. However, that
                               mission repeats itself often. Every time you 
                               re-win, you don't get a new Sequence, but your
                               original powers up. Therefore, if you keep
                               playing and re-gaining for a long time, you will
                               eventually have the most powerful weapon in the
                               game.

               * Special Note: The Sapere Aude is a unique Rod. You win
                               it in Mission #41 Mage Tourney. However, that
                               mission repeats itself often. Every time you 
                               re-win, you don't get a new Sapere Aude, but 
                               your original powers up. Therefore, if you keep
                               playing and re-gaining for a long time, you will
                               eventually have the most powerful Rod in the
                               game.

After completion of Mission #2 Thesis Hunt, Montblanc will explain to you the
Clan Wars and the system. From this point on, you have the option to engage 
other clans. You will notice other clans as they appear as generic Soldier 
sprites walking around on the world map. Walk into one to trigger a battle. 
There are many different clans. This section provides a list of them all. They
are listed in alphabetical order.

This section would not have been completed without the help of Austin Self,

     Aisen Ghosts ~
     =----------=
          Classification: Monster
          Difficulty: Slightly Hard
          Strategy: The Aisen Ghosts clan is made up of some Zombies, a 
                    Jawbreaker, a Floateye, and a Tonberry. As you should
                    already know, Zombies, when defeated revive themselves
                    within three turns. Therefore, the Zombies should be
                    taken care of last. The first thing you might want to 
                    do however, is taking out that pesky Tonberry with its
                    A-Ability, Knife or Karma. The Floateye isn't too 
                    dangerous, and the Jawbreaker is hardly a threat. Take
                    out the Tonberry and you should mostly be fine.

     Antlions ~
     =------=
          Classification: Monster
          Difficulty: Medium
          Strategy: The Antlion clan of monsters should be one of the first
                    ones out. This battle is made up of two Antlions (well
                    obviously), a Jawbreaker, a Bomb, and a Toughskin. The
                    hardest out of all of these would probably be the last,
                    the Toughskin. Apart from that, the rest of the clan is
                    fairly easy to defeat. Remember that Blade Biters (and
                    the weaker versions, Toughskins) are weak against magic
                    attacks.

     Bloodthirsters ~
     =------------=
          Classification: Monster/Viera/Moogle
          Difficulty: Hard
          Strategy: Masterberries are incredibly deadly, but luckily, they
                    only show up later in the game around the same time as
                    when the Vampires begin making their appearances while
                    the Zombies begin to disappear. Your enemies consist
                    of an Ahriman, two Vampires, and an Assassin and Juggler
                    to boot. As long as you take out the Assassin and 
                    Masterberry out quickly, you should be fine with this
                    rather difficult clan battle.

     Brass Dragoons ~
     =------------=
          Classification: Bangaa/Human
          Difficulty: Slightly Hard
          Strategy: This clan is all Bangaa except for the single Paladin
                    which plays his role as the only human. The Strikeback
                    technique becomes annoying, but avoid it by simply not
                    using a Fight move. The Templar's Bonecrusher is easily
                    avoided with a long-range attack, or a Spear jab from
                    two spaces away. Only real difficulty might be the 
                    Templar or either Dragoon, but you should mostly be 
                    fine.

          Strategy: Clan Banisa is a mostly physical gun-ho group of heavy

                    and a White Monk along with an Animist. With Doublehand,
                    the Gladiator can do quite a bit of damage, and the enemy
                    Fighter holds Strikeback which nullifies all incoming Fight
                    moves, and counterattacks. I'd suggest magic-casting units
                    or units with long range here.

     =---------=
          Classification: Moogle/Human/Viera
          Difficulty: Hard
          Strategy: Clan Belmia will probably be a group you might see later
                    in the game. They can also be considered one of the most
                    well-rounded and balanced enemy clans in the game. Your 
                    enemies will most likely hold high Attack power. The Ninja
                    has Double Sword, a devastating S-Ability. Luckily, there
                    are NO magic caster here, unless you count some Assassin
                    abilities as magic.

                    hold Concentrate so no difficulty for the most part. This 
                    is a mediocre clan which shouldn't pose any threats, if

                    you become better equipped with more abilities. In time,

          Strategy: Clan Shalo is another early-game clan that you might be
                    seeing around, but they are a bit tougher than some of
                    their counterparts. One particularly redeeming factor is
                    that every unit is equipped with Feather Boots. Therefore,
                    they are all capable of walking on water.

          Strategy: Just by reading their name, you can tell Cyril Band will
                    be one pushover. Cyril, as you might already know is the
                    first symbol on the world map. Seeing as it appears that
                    early, you can probably expect the job-sets to be a bit
                    easy to defeat. Again, another easy clan with no real 
                    difficulty attached.

     =-----------=
          Classification: Viera/Human/Bangaa/Moogle/Nu Mou
          Difficulty: Slightly Hard
          Strategy: I would have never thought that Doned would actually own
                    a clan himself. Although you don't actually get to fight
                    your brother, his clan is actually fairly strong. The
                    Sage and Fighter are the main problems here. Providing
                    that you actually know how to play, you should still be 
                    able to defeat them easily.

          Classification: Bangaa/Human/Moogle/Viera

          Strategy: This clan is better than some, but overall, they are a 
                    pushover anyhow. The Ninja might be only one that might
                    cause you some problems with Double Sword, but you should
                    be fine for the most part unless you are horrible at 
                    this game.

     =---------=
          Classification: Viera/Human/Moogle
          Difficulty: Slightly Hard
          Strategy: The Gertai Band's only real difficulty would be the 
                    Assassin and the Ninja. From past experience, you could
                    tell that Assassins are always trouble, and a Ninja with
                    Double Sword can provide quite a strike. The Blue Mage
                    has Damage > MP which converts all damage to MP rather
                    than HP. Also, beware of the Juggler's various Stunt
                    abilities which can become damaging.

          Strategy: The very clan representing Bervenia Palace shouldn't be
                    weak. Anyhow, you have quite a team here. Watch out for
                    any damaging attacks, and try to steal, drop, or destroy
                    some of their items to further weaken them. You can win
                    easily, but you might want to put a bit more effort into
                    defeating the Guard Patrol clan.

          Strategy: The Jagd Emissaries are another group of both clan units
                    and monsters. They actually work fairly well together.
                    The main issue here would be the Ahriman. Beware as it
                    likes to get into corners and unleash Roulette on you
                    KOing a random unit. Beware of Double Sword just as well.

                    Black Mage wouldn't be bad.

     Roda Dragons ~

          Classification: Monster
          Difficulty: Medium
          Strategy: Although only two of the actual team are genuine Dragons,
                    you will note that the clan seems to revolve around Fire
                    elemental. I mean, two Firewyrms, a Bomb, and a Jelly
                    should be enough to state that fact. Remember that 
                    Toughskins are easily defeated with magic.

                    like to get it their way with Swords, Spears, and 
                    Knuckles. However, this clan is easily defeated anyway.

          Strategy: Monster clans have mostly been proven easier than the 
                    normal group of units mainly because all monsters have 
                    only a small amount of abilities. In this case, you have
                    a few annoyances, but it shouldn't be anything you hadn't
                    seen before.

                    Beware the Hunter especially.

                    if your clan is weak to magic, the Illusionist will be a

Support, and Combo. Following, you will find them in alphabetical order. If 
you are looking for a particular ability, use the Ctrl-F feature.

          100% Wool ~
          =-------=
               AP: 200
               Requisites: Earth Bell (Animist)
               Description: 100% Wool is a pretty simple ability. Once learned,
                            you can simply use this ability to cast both
                            Protect and Shell on yourself. Just remember that
                            it will run out after a few turns, so don't rely
                            on it too greatly. 
               Available To: Animist

          Abate ~ 
          =---=
               AP: N/A
               Requisites: N/A (Judgemaster)
               Description: Once you actually receive Judgemaster Cid, you
                            get access to some of the greater law-based 
                            abilities. If at any time you need to break a 
                            law, but you don't want to face the Yellow Card
                            penalty, simply have Judgemaster Cid use Abate
                            and your next penalty will be nullified. However,
                            Cid loses that turn. 
               Available To: Judgemaster (Cid Only)

          Acid ~
          =--=
               AP: N/A
               Requisites: Learn From Jelly and/or Ice Flan and/or Cream
                           (Blue Mage)
               Description: The Human Blue Mage uses an unique approach to
                            learning new abilities. You have to have a monster
                            to actually strike you with a particular move. 
                            This makes the Blue Mage one of the most versatile
                            units in the game. In this case, Acid, learned 
                            from a Flan can inflict any random status ailment.

          Addle ~
          =---=
               AP: 200
               Requisites: Master Bow (Hunter)
               Description: If an unit is Addled, it cannot use any Action
                            Abilities until that unit "remembers how to" which
                            takes a few turns anyway... But it's too bad that
                            this Hunter technique is only capable of hitting
                            Monsters. Obviously, that makes Addle's area of
                            affect much smaller. 
               Available To: Hunter         

          Advice ~
          =----=
               AP: 100
               Requisites: Twin Bow (Hunter)
               Description: Advice is the only ability in the game that 
                            actually increases critical hit percentage. If
                            you give an ally Advice, that unit will have a 
                            higher chance of landing a critical hit. Obviously,
                            you can't use Advice on yourself.

          Aero ~
          =--=
               AP: 200
               Requisites: Battle Mace (Sage), Judge Staff (Bishop)
               Description: Here is an effective magic spell which is both
                            cost-effective (in terms of MP) and damaging as
                            well. Aero basically sends a blast of wind at
                            your target for damage. Being not as powerful as
                            Giga Flare or Ultima Blow, you might just find
                            it useful for lesser damage to finish off a 
                            weakened unit or simply cutting away HP. 
               Available To: Sage, Bishop

          Ague ~
          =--=
               AP: 200
               Requisites: Ranger Bow (Assassin)
               Description: Ague is an Assassin technique which inflicts Slow
                            status upon an enemy. If an unit is Slowed, it 
                            obviously slows down. Therefore, you can expect 
                            it lose a few turns. Even better, if you Slow an
                            already slow (in terms of Speed stats) unit, that
                            unit will most likely lose so many turns that it 
                            seems that he or she only moves every five turns 
                            that you receive. Good stuff.

          Aim: Arm ~
          =------=
               AP: 200
               Requisites: Nail Bow (Archer)
               Description: Aiming an arrow an opponent's arms with Aim: Arm
                            will inflict Disable status. Aim: Arm acts much
                            like Aim: Leg's cousin with the fact that it 
                            Disables rather than Immobilizes. If an opponent
                            is Disabled, then it cannot use any form of 
                            actions whatsoever, but (unless you already 
                            Immobilized them) they can still move around at
                            will.
               Available To: Archer

          Aim: Armor ~
          =--------=
               AP: 300
               Requisites: Fey Bow (Sniper)
               Description: Is that Mirror Mail giving your magic-casters 
                            problems, or is that annoying Blaze Robe dis-
                            allowing your Fire techniques. You can easily
                            get rid of these minor Clothing issues with 
                            Aim: Armor. With a single shot, your Sniper is 
                            capable of breaking apart Clothing, thus 
                            making that unit weaker. 
               Available To: Sniper

          Aim: Legs ~
          =-------=
               AP: 200
               Requisites: Thorn Bow (Archer)
               Description: Aim: Legs, is a special Archer technique which 
                            aims an arrow at an opponent's legs (As made 
                            obvious by the ability name). Instead of HP damage
                            however, you will Immobilize that unit instead.
                            Once Immobilized, an unit cannot move around, but
                            actions can still be used.
               Available To: Archer

          Aim: Vitals ~
          =---------=
               AP: 300
               Requisites: Fey Bow (Hunter)
               Description: Shooting an arrow at an opponent's vital organs,
                            expect any random status ailment to occur. 
                            If a shot hits an opponent in the "Sweet Spot," 
                            a random status ailment will appear. You might
                            receive status ailments ranging all the way from
                            Blinded to Immobilized to Silenced. Although you
                            can't really specify which status ailment you will
                            inflict, sometimes it's just fun to shoot your
                            enemy's "Sweet Spot."
               Available To: Hunter

          Aim: Wallet ~
          =---------=
               AP: 200
               Requisites: Hunt Bow (Sniper)
               Description: I personally don't find this ability too 
                            effective. In short, Aim: Wallet aims an arrow
                            at a unit's wallet. If you land your arrow, a 
                            bunch of Gil will be stolen. However, unless you
                            are very low on currency, a few hundred more Gil
                            won't help you too much.
               Available To: Sniper

          Aim: Weapon ~
          =---------=
               AP: 300
               Requisites: Master Bow (Sniper)
               Description: For a Sniper, we have Aim: Armor and Aim: Wallet.
                            The third Aim: [Insert Something Here] technique
                            the Sniper shows off is Aim: Weapon. Shoot an 
                            arrow at an opponent and watch as their weapon 
                            shatters. Aim: Weapon can easily be considered the 
                            best of the Aim: [Insert Something Here] that a 
                            Sniper is capable of learning.
               Available To: Sniper

          Air Blast ~
          =-------=
               AP: 300
               Requisites: Air Blade (Fighter)
               Description: If you know how the Dragoon's "Breath" attacks 
                            work, then you should automatically understand
                            how Air Blast does its job. The area of effect
                            is basically one tile, followed by a line of 
                            three tiles. If you can position an unit right,
                            you could deal damage to more enemies. Air Blast
                            is a Wind elemental attack which can wreak havoc
                            if you know how to position your Fighter.

          Air Render ~
          =--------=
               AP: 200
               Requisites: Kaiser Knuckles (White Monk), Atmos Blade (Fighter)
               Description: Ranged attacks seem to be rather popular among 
                            most physical attacks. The Fencer class has their
                            Nighthawk ability while the Mog Knights hold 
                            their Mog Lance attacks. Similar to the previously
                            mentioned, Air Render is a ranged attack that 
                            deals damage. Practical isn't it?

          Angel Whisper ~
          =-----------=
               AP: N/A
               Requisites: Learn From Titania (Blue Mage)
               Description: The Human Blue Mage uses an unique approach to
                            learning new abilities. You have to have a monster
                            to actually strike you with a particular move. 
                            This makes the Blue Mage one of the most versatile
                            units in the game. In this case, Angel Whisper,
                            learned from a Titania, heals both HP and casts
                            Auto-Life.

          Aphonia ~
          =-----=
               AP: 200
               Requisites: Murasame (Assassin)
               Description: Being one of the earliest Assassin techniques, 
                            Aphonia may not be as effective as some others,
                            but it becomes useful when the opportunity comes.
                            This special Assassin ability inflicts Silence
                            status upon your enemy. Once Silenced, the unit
                            cannot use any abilities which require MP. This
                            can especially be disastrous for mages.

          Astra ~
          =---=
               AP: 200
               Requisites: Sage Crosier (Alchemist), SaveTheQueen (Templar)
               Description: Astra is one of more unique status enhancements.
                            When it is casted, the first status ailment which
                            effects your ally is automatically nullified. If
                            you know that your opponent relies strictly on
                            status disadvantages, then you can defeat that
                            threat with Astra. It can protect more than one
                            unit at a time (Radius-effective) so use it at 
                            beginning of battles when all your allies are  
                            close together.

          Aura ~
          =--=
               AP: 300
               Requisites: Lohengrin (Defender)
               Description: During the free turn that you will probably get

                            on yourself. With that, your chances of survival
                            skyrocket. Also, if you use Meltdown with 
                            Auto-Life on you, you can deal heavy damage 
                            without KOing yourself. As you already know, 
                            Meltdown deals your HP remaining in damage but
                            instantly KOs your unit. With Auto-Life, you can
                            use it without the expensive cost of a KOed 
                            Defender.

               AP: 200
               Requisites: Cheer Staff (White Mage)
               Description: Auto-Life is one of the more useful status 
                            enhancements. By casting Auto-Life onto some
                            of your units, you can actually have them 
                            automatically revived when your ally gets KOed.
                            I find it best to cast this on the weaker units
                            of your team (ie. the magic casters).

               Description: Although Ezel may quite possibly be the worst
                            unit you could have in your clan, I have to admit
                            that his Azoth technique is actually fairly 
                            effective. Unlike the Lamia ability, Night, Azoth
                            only puts all your enemies to Sleep without 
                            touching your own team. Once everyone is asleep, 
                            you can proceed to strike them down. Fun.

               Requisites: Flametongue (Fighter)
               Description: Backdraft's purpose is simple. Much like the
                            Warrior's Body Slam technique, Backdraft deals
                            heavy damage, but it also deals recoil damage
                            back at your unit. Also be aware of the Fire
                            elemental in this move as that can increase the
                            damage or make Backdraft useless. Use Backdraft to 
                            take down larger end opponents.

               Requisites: Learn From Malboro and/or Big Malboro (Blue Mage)
               Description: The Human Blue Mage uses an unique approach to
                            learning new abilities. You have to have a monster
                            to actually strike you with a particular move. 
                            This makes the Blue Mage one of the most versatile
                            units in the game. In this case, Bad Breath is 
                            learned through a Malboro or a Big Malboro. A 
                            number of status ailments will be inflicted making
                            Bad Breath very, very useful.

               Description: This Juggler Action Ability throws a red and white
                            ball at your opponents head to inflict Confuse
                            status. There's no need for any MP, and the range
                            is your Juggler's Move statistics so Ball can be
                            considered a very flexible move.

               Description: Being the last of the "Breath" attacks, Bangaa
                            Cry deals the most damage out of all the three
                            elemental "Breaths," but it also doesn't have any
                            Fire, Thunder, or Ice base to it. Obviously, 
                            Bangaa Cry is most effective against those without
                            elemental weaknesses.

               Requisites: Garnet Staff (Bishop), Mage Masher (Red Mage)
               Description: If you cast Barrier on an ally, you are basically
                            placing both Protect and Shell status upon that 
                            unit. Before you attempt major offensives or 
                            rushes, cast Barrier on all of them to further 
                            strengthen your attack. This goes without 
                            mentioning that a fully leveled-up Paladin with
                            Barrier is nearly invincible.

               Requisites: Shadow Blade (Gladiator), Shadow Blade (Fighter)
               Description: At higher levels, Gladiators and Fighters can deal
                            a lot of damage. Beatdown is basically a reckless
                            strike for an incredible amount of damage. However,
                            due to its nature, accuracy is at an all time low
                            if you choose to take someone on from the front.
                            I would suggest putting your opponent to Sleep or
                            Stopping them.

               Description: Beso Toxico is much like the Sagacity Skill, Bio.
                            They are similar in the fact that both damage and
                            Poison at the same time. With powerful Greatbows,
                            Beso Toxico can deal heavy damage along with 
                            Poison status at the same time; the affected unit
                            will lose HP every single turn if Poison is 
                            evident.

                            Normally, this move would be used for arrests, 
                            but who says that even Cid can't have some fun

               Description: This particular Sagacity Skill deals some damage
                            but it also has a chance of Poisoning. Once
                            your foe is poisoned, that unit will slowly lose
                            HP every turn until it is either KOed or healed.
                            Poison will never disappear unless an item is

                            automatically Doom all on the opposite team. 
                            Although useful, Black Ingot can also turn the
                            tides against you unless you happen to have a

               Description: This Archer Action Ability is simple, yet 
                            effective. Blackout's sole purpose is to inflict
                            Blind status... and yeah; that's all it does.
                            Blinding an opponent will not only lower their
                            hit rate very, very drastically, but their Evade 
                            statistics also  go down the drain.

               Description: The name of this ability says it all. Blind 
                            obviously inflicts Blind status upon your enemies.
                            Once Blinded, an opponent will have a much lower
                            hit rate, and his Evade statistics will go down.
                            Also, Blind status will never disappear unless 
                            an item is used or status is recovered through

               Description: Being one of the earliest Gunner techs you can
                            learn, Blindshot is as useful as it is practical.
                            Blinding is an incredibly useful status ailment,
                            especially in longer battles. Being Blinded, 
                            opponents lose accuracy, and are much easier to

               Description: Blitz is a special attack that holds high accuracy
                            but a low damage rate. However, if an enemy unit 
                            is at low health, Blitz becomes useful. You would
                            be able to not only finish that particular off,
                            but your accuracy prevents any real misses. 
                            While useful, you definitely shouldn't use Blitz

                            You should already be aware that the "-aga" 
                            suffix means the most powerful of the elemental
                            attacks. With heavy Magic Power, Blizzaga becomes

                            many of the others that the Gadgeteer holds. Dispel
                            drives all status enhancements out of an opponent,
                            or in a Gadgeteer's case, your team. Because 
                            Dispeling doesn't do anything else, getting hit

                            for heavier damage at the loss of some HP. I find
                            Body Slam best for finishing units off rather than

                            in terms of usefulness requires that you use the

                            in damage is fairly noticeable, and is especially

                            HP. Also, repeatedly using Boost will continually
                            heighten your next Weapon Attack statistic, but 
                            only for one strike, so if you miss, then you lose

               Description: Chakra is a healing move that is very similar to

                            ability or a Paladin's Nurse technique. They all

                            Chakra differs from the others as it heals much
                            more than First Aid, and it also doesn't heal
                            surrounding units like Nurse. If you are ever
                            short on a healing unit, Chakra works well

                            other healing moves (Curaga for example) may still
                            heal so much that it actually recovers full health
                            anyhow, you can be sure that your unit is at full
                            HP with Cuisine.

               Description: Cupid is one of the Archer class' better A-
                            Abilities. Rather than just Immobilizing, 
                            Disabling, or Blinding, Cupid takes charge by
                            Charming an opponent. If you Charm an enemy, they
                            will act on your side, and either attack their
                            own team, or do something to aid your team such
                            as healing or something similar. Few things are
                            as funny as watching your opponent strike down 
                            his own comrades.

               Description: Cura is the medium of the Cure spells. While the
                            MP cost and AP requirements are bigger than the
                            normal Cure, but smaller than Curaga, Cura still
                            heals an adequate amount of HP.

                            Curaga is a Holy aura which heals an incredible
                            amount of HP. When your White Mage is leveled up
                            with high Magic Power, you can easily keep your

               Description: Although Cure might rest at the very bottom of
                            the barrel in terms of healing, it still is useful
                            at times. With its low MP cost, you can save MP
                            by casting Cure instead of the higher end spells.
                            Even though it might be the least powerful healer,
                            it can still provide enough HP with high Magic

               Description: This Juggler A-Ability is as useful as it is 
                            deadly. With high Weapon Attack, throwing a Dagger
                            will deal heavy damage, sometimes even more than
                            a Juggler's normal Fight move. Throwing a Dagger
                            also has a chance of Disabling your opponent, so
                            if you need to, use it often.

               Description: Wouldn't it be great just to instantly KO any 
                            of your targets with a simple touch of the 
                            button? There are only a handful of abilities 
                            which allow that, but instant KO is pretty useful.
                            The Alchemist technique, Death, automatically
                            cuts out a unit's HP, thus automatically KOing
                            them. Keep in mind that if the opponent is wearing
                            an item which prevents automatic KO, Death will
                            not work.

                            is Doomed, it will automatically be KOed within 
                            three turns. This easily rids the tougher enemies
                            on the map by damning them to an automatic KO.

                            by using Defense? Basically, you cast upon 
                            yourself Shell and Protect status to hopefully
                            cut the damage against you out a bit. This is a 
                            great way to avoid the blunt of an enemy

                            plays its role as a Phantasm technique by flooding
                            the battlefield. With effective Water elemental
                            damage against all enemies, you will want Deluge

               Description: This rather cool-looking gravity attack will suck 
                            half the HP out of an opponent. This is incredibly
                            useful against enemies which hold high HP along
                            with high Defense statistics like Defenders or 
                            Paladins. However, this move is a utility move.
                            Don't expect to take down an opponent with ONLY
                            this move. Remember, it cuts out 1/2, and only

               Description: Doom Archer, one of the best abilities the Sniper
                            class has to offer, can be incredibly dangerous 
                            if used correctly. Basically, Doom Archer deals
                            the amount of HP and MP you have lost. If you are
                            on the verge of death, expect to leave the 
                            battlefield with a scar, as you repeatedly strike
                            down enemies before one finally knocks your Sniper
                            out. As a side note, Doom Archer has one of the
                            coolest animations of this game, if not already 
                            the coolest.

               Description: One certain A-Ability that the Viera class is

                            ability, Doublecast. Basically, Doublecast allows
                            you to cast any two magic spells in one turn.
                            For Red Mages, this is already good enough as it
                            is especially with Sleep + Poison combinations or
                            double-strikes of magic. However, Doublecast 
                            with a higher-end magic class like a Summoner or
                            even an Elementalist can really make your

               Requisite: Twin Bow (Sniper)
               Description: Doubleshot plays its unique role by shooting two
                            arrows at an opponent rather than just one. The
                            only problem is that both arrows deal lesser 
                            damage so if you land both on your target, you 
                            still would probably deal the same amount of 
                            damage if you had just shot one, full arrow.
                            However, if you constantly use a Hunter's Advice
                            technique on your Sniper to raise the critical 
                            hit percentile, you can easily deal more damage
                            as critical hits on both shots can deal quite a 
                            bit more damage.

                            Walk up next to an opponent and use it to cut out
                            1/2. I'd suggest using this on enemies with high

                            in terms of usefulness requires that you use the
                            Hunter A-Ability, Capture, on a monster to send it
                            to the Monster Bank. Once you equip the Soul the

                            and use whichever technique the monster holds. 
                            The usefulness of your Morpher depends on how

                            classes depend on their weapon to really deal any
                            damage. Therefore, once their weapon is gone, they
                            won't deal as much hurt. Even better, you can
                            force long-range units like Gunners and Archers to
                            one-tile ranges by dropping their Bows and Guns.

               Requisites: Fleuret (Elementalist)
               Description: Occasionally, White Mages are rendered useless
                            because of Laws banning Holy. At that point, you
                            can rely on other means of healing. The Viera
                            Elementalist's Earth Heal is a non-Holy based
                            healing spell, which can be pretty effective when
                            the need arises. Just remember that Earth Heal is
                            obviously "Earth" based so take any necessary 
                            precautions before using.

               Description: Only two abilities in Final Fantasy Tactics 
                            Advance are capable of hitting units in a straight
                            line. The first is the Animist's Chocobo Rush, 
                            and the second is the White Monk technique, Earth
                            Render. Although Chocobo Rush is more effective
                            as it deals damage both in front and behind of 
                            the unit, Earth Render still plays a useful role
                            even though it damages only in front. The damage
                            is adequate and you can easily take down a foe
                            by taking advantage of stupidity.

                            an Elementalist's Spirit Magic. The damage dealt
                            is weak, and each "-Veil" attack has an elemental
                            background. The most distinctive factor however
                            are the status ailments. Like Spirit Magic, the
                            "-Veils" also have a chance of affecting status.
                            Earth Veil deals Earth elemental damage as well

               Description: Every single ability that an Elementalist is 
                            capable of casting holds an elemental background.
                            By shifting an unit's elemental weakness, certain
                            spells will work better or worse. Once you 
                            Elementalshift an opponent (Or ally), their 
                            background changes, and you can't really figure
                            out how it did until the next turn. Certain 
                            elementals will double damage, others will deal
                            nothing, and some will heal. It's all really,

               Requisites: Joyeuse (Elementalist)
               Description: Confusing a unit basically removes control from 
                            it. Once Confused, a unit's next move is
                            completely randomized so it's pretty much
                            impossible to predict what might happen next. The
                            affected unit might or might not hurt you or your
                            opponent. Evil Gaze is a Dark Elementalist ability
                            which has a side-effect, Confusion. If you can
                            handle the randomness, Evil Gaze works well.

               Description: Although Exorcise's area of effect is small, it
                            is very useful when an opportunity comes. Exorcise
                            is a special Holy move which "buries" Undead 
                            monsters. Burying Undead is more advantageous to
                            just KOing them as they won't be capable of 
                            regenerating. That pretty much means that as soon
                            as Exorcise hits, that Undead creature is dead...
                            forever.

               Description: Expert Guard is mainly used for one-man offensives.
                            Once casted upon yourself, all damage against your
                            Defender is instantly nullified. With that, you
                            can move toward your enemy and cast Expert Guard
                            to avoid any counter-attacks. However, remember
                            that with Expert Guard equipped, all status 
                            ailments or non-damaging moves have a 100% chance
                            of hitting its mark. Use Expert Guard only when

                            difference is the fact that it deals fire 
                            elemental damage which might make you rethink a 
                            bit to use it to your advantage.

               Description: Far Fist is another Fighter/W. Monk ranged attack.
                            This ability differentiates from Air Render as
                            it deals spread-damage rather than just hitting
                            a single target. Therefore, if your opponent
                            has grouped units together, you can hit all of
                            them with Far Fist. However, remember that Far
                            Fist deals less damage than Air Render so don't
                            use it against single targets.

                            Faster's most practical usage is to avoid moves
                            like Counter or Bonecrusher, but it can also be
                            used to avoid setting off Auto-Regen, Last Haste,

                            Battle Tech move. However, it still has its ups
                            mostly because it can heal status. As long as you
                            aren't Asleep, Stopped, Disabled, or Addled, you
                            can clear your own status. Also, First Aid heals
                            a slight amount of HP. Keep in mind that you can

                            factor however, is the fact that this ability is

                            Juggler to have too high of an Attack stat. Gil

                            set amount of damage is always 30 HP for 30 Gil.

                            definitely generate some exasperation, which is

                            won't even touch you. There are probably a lot

                            can nullify Poison. (Or any other status ailment

               Description: The Human Blue Mage uses an unique approach to
                            learning new abilities. You have to have a monster
                            to actually strike you with a particular move. 
                            This makes the Blue Mage one of the most versatile
                            units in the game. In this case, Hastebreak, 
                            taught by a Blue Mage, lowers Speed and breaks

                            with a chance of Immobilizing at the same time.
                            Once your opponent is Immobilized, you can follow
                            up with some pretty effective attacks. The in-
                            ability to move particularly useful against 
                            physical units which rely mostly on their feet

               Description: While using a White Mage's Esuna or some other
                            status healing spell would be much more practical,
                            you sometimes might have have to use what you 
                            have. Hibernate basically clears all status 
                            ailments, but the downside is the fact that you
                            are 100% vulnerable to all attacks against you for
                            that one turn.

                            Water and Aero, but it also has a Holy element
                            meaning Undead and Dark elements are easily 
                            damaged. Holy is a great spell to use against 
                            those pesky Vampires and Zombies, and even in
                            a normal engagement, it still is a very powerful

                            along with being one whopper of an attack. 
                            Especially with a powerful weapon, Holy Blade can
                            deal incredible damage, and the Holy background
                            can shun away Undead creatures crazily. However, 
                            the main problem is MP cost. Obviously, you 
                            probably won't be using Holy Blade with every
                            turn. Nevertheless, be sure that with this 
                            Chivalry ability will leave a mark.

                            in common; all of them enhance a unit's status.
                            Holy Sign is capable of casting Dispel which runs

                            Hunting deals half-damage, but if you KO an enemy
                            with it, the reward isn't just one JP, but 10 JP!

                            depending on what you are throwing. For example,
                            if you throw a simple Shortsword, you won't deal
                            much damage. However, throwing a greater item as

                            damage. However, keep in mind that the damage 
                            dealt is solely Weapon Attack. Therefore, don't

                            your opponent. For example, if your Templar had
                            lost 150 HP, then he deals that amount in damage
                            against an opponent. As you receive more damage,
                            this rate will increase. If you have 1 HP 
                            remaining out of a good 200, then expect to deal
                            199 HP damage. Trust me, this really becomes

               Description: The Human Blue Mage uses an unique approach to
                            learning new abilities. You have to have a monster
                            to actually strike you with a particular move. 
                            This makes the Blue Mage one of the most versatile
                            units in the game. In this case, Magic Hammer can
                            be learned from a Red Cap. The move deals MP

                            opponent's Magic Points statistics will go down 
                            drastically. The change in stats is really quite

                            practical use for Control abilities is to teach

                            The only way a Morpher can possibly get anywhere
                            in terms of usefulness requires that you use the
                            Hunter A-Ability, Capture, on a monster to send it
                            to the Monster Bank. Once you equip the Soul the
                            monster drops, you can morph into that monster 
                            and use whichever technique the monster holds. 
                            The usefulness of your Morpher depends on how 
                            diligently you work with your Hunter.

               Description: As you already know, Defenders are gifted with
                            very high HP growth. If you want even more HP, 
                            leveling up as a Warrior will provide even more.
                            Meltdown is a self-KO move, but once initiated,
                            you deal your ENTIRE HP remaining in damage. 
                            If your HP is capable of taking out another enemy,
                            by all means, blow yourself up. Even better, you
                            can cast Aura on yourself giving you an Auto-Life
                            which allows you to use Meltdown and basically,
                            revive yourself afterwards. Quite a combination

               Description: The Ninja "-Veil" attacks are very similar to 
                            an Elementalist's Spirit Magic. The damage dealt
                            is weak, and each "-Veil" attack has an elemental
                            background. The most distinctive factor however
                            are the status ailments. Like Spirit Magic, the
                            "-Veils" also have a chance of affecting status.
                            Metal Veil deals Metal elemental damage as well

               Description: Like another Alchemist technique, Flare, this
                            ability also deals heavy damage. At 40 MP compared
                            to Flare's required 36 MP, you can expect Meteor
                            to deal a bit more damage. Not only is it very
                            damaging, but the animation effect is pretty nice
                            to look at also.

                            held by the Icedrake, will improve the Defense and

                            amount of HP. While it won't make too much of a
                            recovery, it can become the difference between life

                            I find pushing an enemy off a cliff to be the most

               Description: Very similar to the Paladin's or Defender's

                            Mog Lance works in striking enemies far away.
                            Unlike the Fighter's or White Monk's Air Render
                            however, damage depends on your Weapon Attack, not

                            that means that all enemy strikes have a 100% 
                            chance of hitting you. Obviously, Mow Down might
                            not be a good ability to use every single turn.
                            I find Mow Down to be best toward the end of 
                            battles in which losing Evade privileges is

                            role as the Fencer's main ranged attack. It deals
                            average damage, and works well against most units.
                            Now for those units that think they can simply

          Nightmare ~
          =-------=
               AP: 300
               Requisites: Kikuichimonji (Assassin)
               Description: Nightmare, I have to admit, is one of the more
                            practical status ailmenting combos in this game.
                            Basically, Nightmare inflicts both Sleep and Doom
                            upon an enemy (Now you know where the ability got
                            its name from). If you let that dozing enemy 
                            be, it will eventually count down from three to 
                            zero without even busting a move. Because of the
                            fact that the unit is asleep, the Doom countdown
                            still inches away eventually reaching in an easy
                            KO.

               Requisites: Defender (Paladin)
               Description: With a Holy aura, a Paladin can heal a slight
                            amount of his own HP through Nurse. The amount
                            of HP healed isn't really too much, but Nurse also 
                            clears status ailments which can be helpful in 
                            getting rid of Blind, Immobilize, etc. Along with
                            healing himself, Nurse also heals surrounding
                            units which boosts its usefulness.

               AP: 300
               Requisites: Masamune (Assassin), Masamune (Ninja)
               Description: Oblivion is another dark, Assassin technique 
                            that is capable of inflicting Addle on your target
                            through an attack to the head. Addle means that
                            the unit you used it on cannot use any Action
                            Abilities. For some units, this can be totally
                            catostrophic. For me, I would much rather just
                            Disable an unit completely to cut out both Fight
                            moves and A-Abilities altogether.

          Oust ~
          =--=
               AP: 200
               Requisites: Windslash Bow (Hunter)
               Description: Oust serves a similar purpose as Parley in the
                            fact that it can sweep weakened monsters off the
                            field. Because you (obviously) can't negotiate
                            with monsters, Parley becomes useless against
                            them. However, Oust covers that problem by being
                            capable of taking monsters off the field, but it
                            can't affect actual units.

               Description: This particular Beastmaster technique allows your
                            Nu Mou to gain access to any Panther on the 
                            field for one turn. Once Controlled, you can move
                            that monster anywhere you'd like and use whatever
                            abilities you want against other enemies. One
                            practical use for Control abilities is to teach
                            your Blue Mage special moves.

          =-----=
               AP: 200
               Requisites: Panther (Morpher)
               Description: The Hunter and Morpher class are known to co-exist.
                            The only way a Morpher can possibly get anywhere
                            in terms of usefulness requires that you use the
                            Hunter A-Ability, Capture, on a monster to send it
                            to the Monster Bank. Once you equip the Soul the
                            monster drops, you can morph into that monster 
                            and use whichever technique the monster holds. 
                            The usefulness of your Morpher depends on how 
                            diligently you work with your Hunter.

               AP: 200
               Requisites: Barong (Paladin)
               Description: Whoever said the only way out of a battle would
                            be to defeat your enemies? Negotiations would
                            always work after all, and a Paladin is capable 
                            of doing that. If an opponent is in critical
                            HP, you can use Parley to have a brief discussion,
                            and make that unit leave the battlefield rather
                            than just KOing that unit. A unit that has left
                            will not, for any reason, come back into battle.

               Description: The Viera Summoners are known for their wide-

                            hit a much larger area (Two tiles from center, 
                            and one diagonally) so you can hit more units with
                            each. Pheonix summons Pheonix to revive all of
                            your fallen allies within a special range.

               Requisites: Flamberge (Rapier)
               Description: Piercethrough is a special move that acts much
                            like a Spear. With Piercethrough, you can attack
                            two tiles directly in front of you, much like a 
                            regular Spear-jab. You can easily reach those 
                            pesky foes as long as they are within two tiles of
                            you. This can also be effective when your foe 
                            lines their units up as you can strike both of 
                            them.

               Description: Being the most simple of status ailment abilities, 
                            Poison is still as effective as it is deadly.
                            Once your unit casts Poison upon your enemy,
                            they will take consistent damage every turn.
                            Poison will never disappear unless its status

               AP: N/A
               Requisites: Learn From Red Panther (Blue Mage)
               Description: The Human Blue Mage uses an unique approach to
                            learning new abilities. You have to have a monster
                            to actually strike you with a particular move. 
                            This makes the Blue Mage one of the most versatile
                            units in the game. In this case, Poison Claw can
                            be learned from a Red Panther. Your Blue Mage will
                            deal damage as well as having a chance to Poison.

               Description: The "-break" attacks of the Soldier and Warrior 
                            are very notorious for their usefulness. This 
                            time, it's Powerbreak. With a simple strike, your
                            opponent's Weapon Attack statistics will go down 
                            drastically. The change in stats is really quite

               Description: With a heat-wave, Prominence is an Illusionist
                            technique meaning that instead of targetting a 
                            certain enemy, all enemies are targetted with each
                            being damaged. In this case, Prominence is a 
                            damage-all Fire elemental attack. While weak 
                            in power overall, when powered up with Geomancy,
                            it can deal quite some damage.

               Description: Protect is the simplest method of simply raising a 
                            unit's Weapon Defense. Not only that, but it is
                            actually fairly effective! Being radius-effective,
                            casting Protect on your allies at the beginning of
                            large-scale battles is almost a must. You should 
                            use this if you want to actually survive the 
                            strike of a highly physical unit. In fact, use it
                            for anything that has to deal with Weapon Attack

               Description: Sometimes, taking down high-HP units as Defenders
                            or Paladins can be a pain. Luckily, you can take
                            off a fourth of that HP with Quarter. Although
                            Demi is more effective, taking down that crucial
                            1/4 can set up a nice KO.

                            would be Quicken. Because Time Mages are made to 
                            support your units rather than attack, Quicken 
                            can simply give the turn immediately to one of 
                            your allies. This works to finish off already 
                            weakened units, or to simply give that particular

                            Advance. Not only does it raise fallen units, but
                            Raise can also be used as a healing move which
                            actually heals more than subpar HP. This ability

                            You can easily stupify units relying on MP such
                            as Black Mages or Illusionists by simply taking
                            away their MP. The fact that Rasp is also area-
                            effective, you can defeat the threat of multiple

               Description: Being able to simply deflect magic spells back
                            is a fun thing to do. Once Reflected, those

                            and magical spells simply bounce off. However,
                            there is one disadvantage. Reflect also bounces
                            off good magic. Want to heal your unit? Too bad,

                            revives KOed units.

          =--=
               AP: 200
               Requisites: Rondell Dagger (Juggler)
               Description: Ring is a Juggler technique which throws a ring
                            (obviously) at your opponent to Stop them. Stop-
                            ping a unit allows you to hit them with 100% 
                            accuracy every turn. Also, they won't be able to
                            move or attack once Stopped. Ring is a great way
                            to set up a Holy Blade or Beatdown attack.

          Rockbeast ~ 
          =-------=
               AP: 200
               Requisites: Conch Shell (Beastmaster)
               Description: This particular Beastmaster technique allows your
                            Nu Mou to gain access to any Rockbeast on the 
                            field for one turn. Once Controlled, you can move
                            that monster anywhere you'd like and use whatever
                            abilities you want against other enemies. One
                            practical use for Control abilities is to teach
                            your Blue Mage special moves.

          Rockseal ~
          =------=
               AP: 300
               Requisites: Kotetsu (Assassin)
               Description: Rockseal is an effective ability in many respects.
                            Basically, this Assassin technique Petrifies an
                            enemy on the spot. In short, Petrifying an unit
                            turns them into stone. Petrify differs from other
                            status ailments like Stop with the fact that it
                            will never wear off until the status is cleared.
                            At the end of battles, all Petrified units count
                            as KO, so Rockseal is an alternative way of ending
                            battles.

          Roulette ~
          =------=
               AP: N/A
               Requisites: Learn From Ahriman (Blue Mage)
               Description: The Human Blue Mage uses an unique approach to
                            learning new abilities. You have to have a monster
                            to actually strike you with a particular move. 
                            This makes the Blue Mage one of the most versatile
                            units in the game. In this case, Roulette is a 
                            special move that can be learned from an Ahriman.
                            Basically, Roulette moves around the field and KOs
                            any random unit, both ally or enemy. If you can 
                            handle its unpredictability, you will find it
                            very useful.

          Rush ~

               AP: 100
               Requisites: Sweep Blade (Gladiator), Sweep Blade (Fighter)
               Description: A great way to damage your opponent is to push
                            them off cliffs and high areas. Ever try to jump
                            off a 30 feet high ledge? If you did, it 
                            probably hurt, correct? Rush pushes units back
                            one tile in which you can use to your advantage.
                            Apart from throwing off ledges, you can also use
                            Rush to knock away foes from your position or
                            to defend another unit.

               AP: 300
               Requisites: Arch Sword (Paladin)
               Description: Being capable of damaging all surrounding units,
                            Saint Cross is a Holy attack which deals damage
                            around. Because of the Holy elemental, all Undead
                            creatures should beware of their next move. 
                            Along with that, Dark-based units are dealt double
                            damage. Overall, the damage radius is effective,
                            but only if your Paladin is actually "surrounded."
                            After all, that's what Saint Cross does.

               AP: 300
               Requisites: Burglar Sword (Soldier)
               Description: Throughout the game, you might find certain units
                            carrying hidden items. A Soldier is capable of
                            detecting those items through Sensor, which 
                            basically conducts a search of a unit for any of
                            those hidden items.

          Shadowbind ~
          =--------=
               AP: 200
               Requisites: Fey Bow (Assassin)
               Description: Stopping an unit is similar to putting an unit to
                            Sleep in the respect that both disallow the
                            target to move, and provide 100% accuracy for 
                            every strike against. However, with Sleep status,
                            once HP loss is taken, that unit will wake up.
                            Shadowbind Stops a unit, and even if you strike 
                            that unit repeatedly, that unit won't respond 
                            until it actually comes back into time. Stopping
                            someone becomes very effective if you use it 
                            to its best respect.

               Requisites: Silver Rapier (Fencer)
               Description: Shadowstick is a special stat-reducing strike that
                            hinders movement, which in turn, hinders Speed.
                            Use Shadowstick against an opponent to cut out 
                            portions of their stats. You can easily maintain
                            superiority by making turns come longer for
                            your enemy by lowering their Speed.

               Description: Animists are known for their unique abilities.
                            Sheep Count plays a role as Sleep-caster. Your
                            Animist will call upon sheep to put your enemies
                            to Sleep. It can affect more than one at a time
                            which makes it extra useful.

               Description: Much like a cousin to the other technique, Protect,
                            the White Mage ability Shell plays its role by
                            helping to resist Magic Power attacks. At beginning
                            of battles, it would be pretty smart to cast some
                            Shell on allies to take less punishment from those
                            God-powerful enemy spells.

               Description: While Shining Air deals medium Wind damage, it is
                            best used for Blinding an opponent. Once Blinded,
                            a unit's hit rate falls down very drastically, and
                            that particular unit's Evade statistics drops 
                            heavily. Blinding is very useful, especially 
                            against those physical units who won't quit it
                            with Holy Blade or Beatdown.

               Description: The Viera Summoners are known for their wide-

                            hit a much larger area (Two tiles from center, 
                            and one diagonally) so you can hit more units with
                            each. Shiva summons Shiva to inflict Ice damage

               Description: All monsters should learn to stay away from a

               Description: Silence is a great way to get rid of those pesky

                            throwing at you. In fact, Silence cuts out all
                            abilities that cost MP, so you can easily disable
                            a Holy Blade Paladin with a quick Silence. While
                            Disabling might be preferred over Silence, it can
                            still be useful in knocking out a magic caster's

                            This is a great, long-range way to knock out a

               Requisites: Hard Knuckles (Gadgeteer)
               Description: Blinding is an effective ability mainly because of
                            the fact that it doesn't recover itself without

                            they wake up. However, the best way to take 
                            advantage of this status ailment is to take 100%
                            accuracy with the next attack against that unit.

               Description: Although the Elementalist ability, Sliprain, does

                            main purpose is to inflict Slow status upon your
                            enemy. Slowing an already slow unit (In terms of
                            Speed statistics) will really be effective, as 
                            sometimes, it can get so bad; that unit getting

                            will drastically lower their Speed, and allow you

                            opponents so you can damage more than one unit at

               Description: The main difference between Soul Sphere and the
                            other Templar MP-damaging attack is the fact that
                            Rasp costs MP. Soul Sphere deals less MP damage,
                            but it doesn't require any MP. Depending on the
                            situation, you might want to cast Soul Sphere to
                            save MP. It's your call.

                            time, it's Speedbreak. With a simple strike, your
                            opponent's Speed statistics will go down 
                            drastically. The change in stats is really quite

               Description: Being animated very well, Star Cross is my favorite

                            animation is cool enough as it is, I find that

                            Undead creatures are heavily damaged. Even so,
                            Star Cross deals a good amount of damage, and can

                            name as the Rod that happens to teach it. Anyhow,
                            Stardust is the only Phantasm technique which 
                            actually doesn't hold an element. However, don't
                            get cocky just yet. Instead, you might find a 
                            rain of meteors crashing down on your head.

               Description: The Human Blue Mage uses an unique approach to

                            This is not something you want to miss out on. 
                            Once stolen, that ability is your Thieves' to

                            other is for Totema strikes which requires a total
                            of 10 JP. Therefore, if you are a few JP short of
                            10, you can always "steal" some of it from an 
                            opponent, or even "borrow" some from an ally. 
                            Keep in mind that you won't steal too much JP at

                            in front of my face would put me even close to 
                            being Charmed, this ability is still useful. Use
                            it to Charm your opponent for a few turns. Use it
                            on high-powered enemies and watch as they slowly
                            KO their own team for a few turns.

               AP: 300
               Requisites: Yoichi Bow (Archer)
               Description: A great way to finish off an already weakened 
                            opponent is through Take Aim. If you choose to 
                            use it, note that the damage dealt is incredibly
                            low when compared to a normal attack, but the 
                            accuracy ranges from perfect to near-perfect. 
                            I'd suggest using Take Aim to finish off weakened
                            units with precision accuracy unlike a regular
                            Fight move which has a chance of missing.

                            Like all Phantasm Magic, Tempest damages every
                            enemy on the battlefield. Because of that, you 
                            might find that it doesn't do that much damage.
                            However, power it up with Geomancy or Turbo MP
                            and you have a force to be reckoned with.

                            chucks a weapon at an opponent for damage. The

                            You should already be aware that the "-aga" 
                            suffix means the most powerful of the elemental
                            attacks. With heavy Magic Power, Thundaga becomes

                            as a mediocre blast of Thunder. As long as you have
                            high Magic Power, you should be able to bring the
                            hurt down with Thundara.

                            they magically morph into a harmless frog. While

                            abilities you want against other enemies. One
                            practical use for Control abilities is to teach

               Description: Much of the time when your Defender is the last 
                            unit on the field, your opponent will probably try
                            to surround you with units to block your path.
                            However, a simple Tremor would not only damage 
                            those ganging up on you, but also push them back
                            one tile to provide some breathing room. Another
                            great use for Tremor would be of course, to push
                            enemy units off cliffs for damage.

               Description: The Human Blue Mage uses an unique approach to
                            learning new abilities. You have to have a monster
                            to actually strike you with a particular move. 
                            This makes the Blue Mage one of the most versatile
                            units in the game. In this case, Twister cuts 
                            an enemy's HP in half. You can learn it from a 
                            Lamia.

               Description: While the Sage is already a powerful magic-casting
                            unit with Giga Flare in its arsenal, Ultima Blow
                            just proves it. At a heavy MP cost, your Sage can
                            use Ultima magic to deal a very heavy amount of
                            damage to an enemy. Laugh as opponents fall upon
                            their faces as your Sage creates a path of 
                            destruction. The only difficulty would probably 
                            be finding a Zeus Mace. Believe me, that won't be
                            easy.

               Requisites: Materia Blade (Mog Knight)
               Description: Few jobs have the ability to use Ultima magic, but
                            the Mog Knight luckily, is one of them. While the
                            MP cost is pretty high at a whopping 60, a single
                            strike is usually enough to take down a unit  
                            easily. However, since a Mog Knight's MP growth is
                            less than par, you probably won't be using Ultima 
                            Charge EVERY. SINGLE. TURN. Nevertheless, have 
                            fun striking down opponents with Ultima Charge.

                            Masher is a heavy strike against an opponent 
                            using especially deadly Ultima art. Once mastered
                            completely (That will take awhile with 999 AP 
                            obviously), equipping a high-Attack weapon like
                            the Masamune 100, and using Ultima Masher will
                            result in pain. Owie.

                            Shot. At the cost of 60 MP like the other attacks,
                            you can on the whim of your arrow, deal incredibly
                            heavy damage. Even the most tank-like of the 
                            physical classes could fall within a single arrow
                            with credits given to Ultima Shot. Even better,
                            you can carry over Ultima Shot to a high-Attack
                            Fighter or Paladin of whom will be sure to give

               Description: Judging from past experiences with "Ultima" magic,

                            definitely going to hurt. However, like all 
                            Ultima attacks, MP cost is high and a Gladiator's
                            MP growth is already sub-par as it is. Much of 
                            the time, you might have to resort to regular 
                            strikes being able to use Ultima Sword two or

                            statistics instead. It's always useful to lower

                            is weak, and each "-Veil" attack has an elemental
                            background. The most distinctive factor however
                            are the status ailments. Like Spirit Magic, the
                            "-Veils" also have a chance of affecting status.
                            Water Veil deals Water elemental damage as well

               AP: 100
               Requisites: Hard Knuckles (White Monk)
               Description: Whirlwind is a modest White Monk ability which 
                            serves a straightforward purpose. This technique
                            basically deals damage to all surrounding units.
                            With high Attack power, the damage statistics
                            will be higher, but apart from HP damage, Whirlwind
                            serves no purpose other than hurting all 
                            surrounding units.

          White Flame ~
          =---------=
               AP: 100
               Requisites: Flamberge (Elementalist)
               Description: The Fire-based White Flame is the Elementalist's
                            second healing spell. White Flame differs from 
                            Earth Heal with the fact that it covers an aura
                            rather than a single unit. Therefore, you can heal
                            more than one at a time. Of course, the MP cost 
                            can be expected to be a bit higher. Apart from
                            that, just remember that White Flame is "Fire" 
                            based unlike Earth Heal which is obviously "Earth"
                            elemental.

          White Wind ~
          =--------=
               AP: N/A
               Requisites: Learn From Sprite (Blue Mage)
               Description: The Human Blue Mage uses an unique approach to
                            learning new abilities. You have to have a monster
                            to actually strike you with a particular move. 
                            This makes the Blue Mage one of the most versatile
                            units in the game. In this case, White Wind is
                            taught by a Sprite. It heals HP. The amount healed
                            is the amount that your Blue Mage has remaining 
                            in terms of HP.

          Wild Swing ~

               Description: No physical class is complete without a radius

                            version of the White Monk Whirlwind or the 
                            Fencer Swallowtail is made up with Wild Swing.
                            While Fighters and Gladiators are known to deal
                            more damage (obviously), Wild Swing is nothing
                            to go crazy over. Sometimes, it's just better to
                            damage all surrounding units rather than just 
                            one. It would be the smart thing to do after all.

               Description: While the animation in this particular Phantasm
                            move is a bit... questionable, the damage is still
                            enough to make you want to take advantage of Wild
                            Tornado. Being capable of hitting all enemy units
                            on the battlefield, you can't go wrong with a 
                            Wind elemental attack as Wild Tornado.

               AP: 200
               Requisites: Kotetsu (Ninja)
               Description: The Ninja "-Veil" attacks are very similar to 
                            an Elementalist's Spirit Magic. The damage dealt
                            is weak, and each "-Veil" attack has an elemental
                            background. The most distinctive factor however
                            are the status ailments. Like Spirit Magic, the
                            "-Veils" also have a chance of affecting status.
                            Wood Veil deals Wood elemental damage as well
                            as being capable of Immobilize a target.

               AP: 300
               Requisites: Blood Sword (Dragoon)
               Description: Being the Wyrm-killers they are, Dragoons should
                            definitely hold at least one anti-Dragon ability.
                            Wyrmkiller serves that purpose and fills it in
                            well. Basically, your Dragoon can deal double 
                            damage to Dragons with Wyrmkiller. With a powerful
                            Spear like the Odin Lance, the damage really can
                            rack up.

               Requisites: Buster Sword (Dragoon)
               Description: This Dragoon technique basically makes an enemy 
                            weakened Dragon leave the battlefield. Rather 
                            than having to KO it, your Dragoon can easily 
                            "cause" it to leave. Therefore, it cannot be 
                            revived again as it disappears forever.

                            out. Because he wasted his time, Cid will clear
                            a Yellow Card from an ally's record. For those
                            of you that don't break Laws often, it's probably
                            cool. For those of you that always seem to gain

                            if you are a gambler and enjoy taking chances, you
                            can use Yellow Spring to either cast Barrier on
                            your team... or of course, the other team. Keep in
                            mind especially that your opponents will be much
                            more difficult to take down if Yellow Spring

               Description: Absorb MP is a great way to gain something out of

                            your unit will automatically absorb the amount of
                            MP used against you. This is a great way to get
                            back at those Turbo MP using Illusionists, Sages,

               Description: Auto-Regen will initiate itself as soon as your

                            status ailments, so your enemy might try to work
                            their way around it. Therefore, I'd suggest you
                            use your own Weapon Attacks (The Paladin's Subdue
                            works wonders) to activate it yourself. Once Auto-
                            Regen is in use, it will heal a little bit of
                            HP every single turn. Keep in mind that your foe
                            could use any Dispel spell to get rid of it.

                            Hunter, Archer, Sniper, or Assassin will be

                            Faster can nullify Block Arrows and still get

               Description: Take your current Weapon Attack and multiply it
                            by 1.5. For physical units like the Templar, that
                            final value should be pretty high. Basically, 
                            with Bonecrusher equipped, whenever an opponent
                            strikes you at weapon range, you counterattack
                            with 1.5 x Weapon Attack. Usually, that can be
                            a quick KO. However, this R-Ability differs from 
                            Counter as you actually have to be hit (Misses 
                            don't count) or else you won't counter.

                            Hurl and the Ninja's Throw. However, not only do
                            you block the attack, but the item thrown is also

                            can Fight), you will follow up that attack with
                            a counterattack from your own unit. Counter will
                            still be activated even when the attack against 
                            you misses.

                            the game. Basically, Dragonheart automatically
                            casts Auto-Life on your Dragoon every time you are
                            struck by a weapon. Therefore, your unit will stay
                            invincible unless your opponent uses magic or 
                            takes down your Dragoon with a single strike. 
                            Dragonheart is a very annoying move to go up 
                            against, and can sometimes guarantee you the win

               Description: Berserking a unit will normally cause them to turn
                            red which in turn, makes them automatically move
                            on their own to attack an opponent. Berserk is one
                            of those status ailments which can be used both
                            advantageously or disadvantageously. In terms of
                            a Defender, you might want to Berserk yourself to
                            attack the nearest enemy. Once Berserked, you deal
                            much more damage than a regular strike. Last
                            Berserk occurs once your Defender enters the

               Requisites: Lordly Robe (Time Mage)
               Description: HP critical is reached by having one of your units
                            reach a very low HP level. They will be keeling
                            over when they happen to run into this level of
                            low HP. Last Quicken will have your unit cast
                            Quicken upon themselves to hopefully give them a
                            chance to either do something, or heal themselves
                            before they actually DO keel over.

          Reflex ~

               AP: 300
               Requisites: Mirage Vest (Sage), Mirage Vest (White Monk),
                           Mirage Vest (Fencer), Genji Armor (Paladin)
               Description: Reflex is one of the greater R-Abilities found in
                            Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. With Reflex, you
                            can automatically avoid any incoming Fight move.
                            Yes, that means that all Fight moves against you
                            are stopped completely. With Fight out of the way,
                            your enemy will be forced to use other measures
                            against you. A Reflex-ive (pun completely intended)
                            unit is very hard to strike down.

          Return Fire ~
          =---------=

               Requisites: Power Sash (Juggler), Power Sash (Assassin)
               Description: A few jobs are capable of using Bows or Greatbows. 
                            With Return Fire as your R-Ability, all arrows
                            which attempt to sail at your unit will be caught,
                            and thrown back for damage, or whatever the arrow
                            attempted to do (ie. Cupid will Charm the arrow-
                            launcher). This is particularly useful and stops
                            arrows against you.

          Return Magic ~

               AP: 300
               Requisites: Black Robe (Black Mage), Black Robe (Bishop)
               Description: Return Magic is one of the best magic-based 
                            R-Abilities of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. 
                            Basically, if you are struck by magic, you will
                            re-cast the spell back at the original caster.
                            You don't even have to learn the technique; your
                            unit will simply cast the magic spell against
                            your opponent. Basically, this is a magic version
                            of Counter, except the possibilities are more
                            varied.

          Strikeback ~
          =--------=
               AP: 300
               Requisites: Wygar (Gladiator), Wygar (Fighter)
               Description: There are a few Reaction Abilities that deal 
                            damage "back" at an opponent, but Strikeback is
                            quite possibly the best of them all. With
                            Strikeback learned, all incoming Fight moves are
                            blocked, and a counter-attack instantly follows
                            up. Although the effect radius is only that of
                            Fight moves (Therefore, it's easily bypassed), 
                            it's always fun watching your Gladiator "own" a 
                            unit stupid enough to try to hit him with  
                            Strikeback. The AI has been known to do that 
                            often. Haha.

          Concentrate ~
          =---------=
               AP: 300
               Requisites: Longbarrel (Gunner), Target Bow (Archer)
               Description: Concentrate is a specialty S-Ability which ups
                            the accuracy of an attack to the 90% range. 
                            Therefore, Gunners and Archers usually have a 
                            hit rate of 95% even from the front! However, 
                            the possibilities can continue to grow as you
                            place Concentrate on a Mog Knight with Ultima
                            Charge. Total ownage anyone?

          Double Sword ~
          =----------=
               AP: 999
               Requisites: Nosada (Ninja)
               Description: The Human race has access to one of the best 
                            Support Abilities found in Final Fantasy Tactics
                            Advance! The Ninja ability, Double Sword, allows
                            you to carry two weapons in each hand. With 
                            each turn, you can strike down an opponent with 
                            both weapons for very heavy damage! However,
                            because of the fact that both hands are occupied,
                            Shields obviously cannot be held.
               Available To: Ninja

          Doublehand ~
          =--------=
               AP: 300
               Requisites: Venus Blade (Gladiator), Venus Blade (Fighter)
               Description: Blades are one-handed. That's fundamental. 
                            However, Doublehand allows all one-handed Blades
                            (Well, all Blades are one-handed so that is kind
                            of void) to be carried in two hands. This 
                            will increase damage, but uses up both your hands.
                            That basically means that Shields and any other
                            "hand"-held equipment cannot be used as long as 
                            Doublehand is used.

          Geomancy ~
          =------=
               AP: 300
               Requisites: Sage Robe (Black Mage)
               Description: Although the definition of this S-Ability is 
                            clear and concise, Geomancy is not a S-Ability
                            to underestimate. The simply definition for the
                            simple person would be; Geomancy ups Magic Power.
                            Seeing as Black Mages already have their fair
                            share of Magic Power, Geomancy will make them
                            even more of a foe to be reckoned with.

          Half MP ~
          =-----=
               AP: 300
               Requisites: Light Robe (Illusionist), Light Robe (Bishop),
                           Light Robe (Summoner)
               Description: You have Turbo MP which doubles the amount of
                            MP used, and you also have Half MP which cuts the
                            amount of MP required down the middle. Unlike
                            Turbo MP however, Half MP doesn't do anything to 
                            the damage or accuracy. In fact, all spells casted
                            with Half MP equipped do the same amount of damage
                            as they originally would. If you are uptight 
                            about running out of MP, equip Half MP.

          Immunity ~
          =------=
               AP: 300

                           (Blue Mage)
               Description: While Immunity isn't really that amazing of a
                            Support Ability, its purpose is simple. Basically,
                            it cuts out all the most basic of status ailments.
                            Instead of having to use items to avoid status
                            problems, you can simply equip Immunity. This is 
                            a useful ability for a utility unit rather than 
                            an attacker.

               AP: 400

               Description: If you expect your Blue Mage to be able to learn
                            any monster techniques whatsoever, you better 
                            have Learning equipped. Without Learning, your
                            Blue Mage won't learn any abilities. Obviously,
                            you will find this S-Ability very important while
                            raising a Blue Mage.

          Magic Pow+ ~
          =--------=
               AP: 300
               Requisites: Morning Star (Alchemist), Colichemarde (Red Mage)
               Description: Magic Pow+, as its name states, powers up all
                            Magic Power statistics. It is obviously the most
                            practical of them all to say the least. Spells
                            like Giga Flare and Meteor are powered up quite
                            drastically while Magic Pow+ is equipped. However,
                            you can still look into some better magic 
                            increasing abilities. Still, Magic Pow+ covers all
                            magic spells rather than just a portion.

          =---------=
               AP: 300
               Requisites: Adaman Vest (Thief), Adaman Vest (Alchemist)
               Description: Getting a useful piece of equipment stolen or 
                            destroyed can be particularly annoying. Maintenance
                            however makes sure that your equipped items are
                            kept safe from Thieves' Steal abilities or from
                            getting destroyed or dropped.

               Requisites: Claymore (Warrior), Vigilante (Soldier)
               Description: Monkey Grip's description might sound a bit 
                            confusing but it's easy to understand. Basically,
                            this ability allows a unit to carry all swords
                            which require two hands in one. This means that
                            all Broadswords and Greatswords won't take up
                            two hands. This allows you to carry a Shield or
                            use that free hand for something else.

          =----------=
               AP: 300

                           Bronze Shield (Soldier)
               Description: Only a select few jobs are capable of carrying 
                            around Shields. Luckily, you can pass on the 
                            Shield carrying ability once Shieldbearer is 
                            mastered. This is useful for passing on Shields
                            to Jugglers or Fighters.

          Turbo MP ~
          =------=
               AP: 300
               Requisites: White Robe (White Mage)
               Description: Wouldn't you like all your magic spells powered up
                            with higher accuracy and more damage overall? 
                            Well, Turbo MP can create that... at the cost of
                            double your MP spell. However, this can generate
                            many advantages. Jobs like Black Mages and 
                            Illusionists will be powered up incredibly, and
                            the amount of damage is pretty high once Turbo MP
                            is activated. If you can live with the double MP
                            cost, this ability is for you.

               AP: 300
               Requisites: Trident (Templar), Nike Bow (Hunter)
               Description: Rather than leveling up, Weapon Atk+ provides a 
                            more practical way to add more damage to your
                            strike. Power up attacks and watch the bodies 
                            mount. With Weapon Atk+ equipped, you can shoot a 
                            damaging arrow from afar with a Hunter or have a 
                            Spear-jabbin' powerhouse with it equipped on a 
                            Templar. Say hello to instant KO.

                           Diamond Armor (Paladin)
               Description: Are you constantly being struck down at the hands
                            of a high-powered Fighter or Paladin? Well, you
                            can absorb some of that damage through Weapon 
                            Def+. This Support Ability works as well as it is
                            practical. With Weapon Def+ equipped, the chances
                            of surviving weapon strikes grows. The difference
                            is actually noticeable.

| |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 13. Monster Listing ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[13000]~| |
|_|=========================================================================|_|

Monsters are creatures that differ from the normal unit. They are usually 
pretty easy to tell apart. One noticeable feature is the fact that monsters
are split up into species. Listed below are all the possible specie of 
monsters in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. Keep in mind that because an 
ability is listed, the monster having access to that particular ability is
not guaranteed.

     Bomb ~
     =--=
          Difficulty: Easy
          Description: Here, we have two different types. Bombs and Grenades. 
                       The standard Bomb, red in color, is basically composed
                       entirely of Fire. On the contrary, the standard 
                       Grenade, blue in color, is completely made up of Ice!
                       However, both types have one thing in common, they
                       are easy to take out and defeat.

                       in terms of looks, but there's need to take extreme
                       precautions. The Jawbreaker might give you some 
                       problem and the LV3 and LV5 attacks might pose a few
                       threats. The latter two abilities are easily avoided
                       by checking your levels however.

          Description: Some people consider Dragons to be the most difficult
                       to defeat out of all of the monsters. Much of the time,
                       enemy Dragons will hold high HP values, damaging Weapon
                       Attack statistics, and iron-clad Weapon Defense. Along
                       with that, Dragons are the proud wielders of the 
                       "Breath" attacks. Make sure you take caution around
                       Dragons, and be sure to avoid their strikes and 
                       damaging blows.

     Flan ~
     =--=
          Difficulty: Easy/Medium
          Description: Flan are a special group of monsters. Basically, they
                       look much like blobs of jelly with eyes. However, Flan
                       are particularly annoying because of the fact that they
                       are nearly invincible against physical attacks. 
                       Therefore, the only way to damage them is to take 
                       advantage of their low Magic Resistance. Be sure to 
                       work off of elemental weaknesses too (exp. Ice against
                       Fire will be super-effective).

                       Obviously, being the toughies that they are, Weapon
                       Defense is incredibly high. Physical attacks will deal
                       very little damage against these heathen. While the 
                       Toughskin is difficult in itself, the Blade Biter is 
                       even more of an annoyance being capable of dealing 999
                       HP damage at critical health or breaking your unit's
                       weapons.

     Tonberry ~
     =------=
          Difficulty: Medium/Hard
          Description: Mysterious and sly, Tonberries are strange creatures
                       wielding lamps and their signature knives. Tonberries
                       won't actually attack you, but they use a special 
                       ability, Knife, that actually cuts out 9/10 of your
                       unit's HP probably placing them in the critical zone.
                       However, Tonberries are naturally slow-movers, and can
                       only move two tiles at a time. Therefore, if you stay
                       far away at each turn, you should be able to avoid 
                       Knife for the most part.
          Abilities:
                       Tonberry

     Undead ~

          Description: The Undead class of monsters is the only class in the
                       game in which both types don't resemble each other.
                       However, both Zombies and Vampires have one thing in 
                       common, the fact that they can regenerate after three
                       turns. That's right, if you allow an Undead creature 
                       to stay KOed for three turns, it will automatically 
                       revive itself. Therefore, it would be good to KO 
                       Undead at the end of battles to avoid this particularly
                       annoying factor.

||                           14.1. The Monster Bank                 [14100]  ||
[]---------------------------------------------------------------------------[]

The Monster Bank is an interesting little area found in Cyril. At first, it
is a bit useless, but once you get yourself a Morpher and a Hunter, it will 
become much more useful. 

The idea is to capture a monster. To do that, you need a Hunter and the 
A-Ability, Capture. With that, you can capture weakened monsters and send them 
to the Monster Bank. However, catching monsters is no easy matter. First of 
all, it becomes nearly impossible to capture a monster while its at full health
and facing you. To increase your chances, weaken it to critical status. To 
further increase your chance to 100%, put it to sleep or Stop it. Following, 
use Capture and it will be transported to the Monster Bank.

If you want to visit your captured monsters, head to the area in Cyril. Your 
monster will be listed (Maximum of 20 slots) and all other monsters which you
have caught before will also be there. Upon sending a monster to the Monster 
Bank, you get a certain something. Every monster drops a special item called 
a Soul. There is a Soul for these nine monster classes;
 
     1. Bomb (Bomb, Grenade)
     2. Goblin (Goblin, Red Cap)
     3. Antlion (Antlion, Jawbreaker)
     4. Dragon (Icedrake, Firewyrm, Thundrake)
     5. Flan (Jelly, Ice Flan, Cream)
     6. Lamia (Lamia, Lilith)
     7. Floateye (Floateye, Ahriman)
     8. Panther (Red Panther, Coeurl)
     9. Malboro (Malboro, Big Malboro)

These Souls as explained before are used by Morphers, a Nu Mou job. When the
ability for the Soul is learned, the Morpher has the ability to use that 
monster's skills in battle. At first, the Soul won't be too powerful and you
will find that the Morpher isn't too effective but if you visit your monster
a few times, it will grow in power. The more it likes you, the more powerful
it becomes.

To make a monster happy, you will need to feed it items. At first, it will
give you a mean, "Grrr..." However, give it a few items (It might or might not
like it) and it will soon get a bit happier and enjoy seeing you with phrases
as, "Thanks for dropping by." When you make a monster happy to the maximum, it
will exclaim, "I love you [Insert Name Here]. No, really, I love you!" Then
you know that you have made the monster to its most powerful position and the
Soul becomes incredibly powerful. However, you still have to take care of the
monster.

When your Morpher learns many Souls and you manage to keep all your monsters
happy, your Morpher becomes a very powerful figure. Take advantage of the
Monster Bank as it can easily give you the edge in battle.

There are a few Secret Characters that may join your clan at any point in 
your game. Included are Ritz, Shara, even Judgemaster Cid. These three will 
join your clan indefinitely as long as you defeat the game and complete all 
300 missions. If you want to collect the more obscure secret characters, read
below. 

The following four may join your clan, only if you send one of your units off
on a Dispatch mission with a certain Mission Item equipped. Each of these four
have special techniques which are very powerful, and they also have very high
stats:

      Lini (Mog Knight) ~

           You can get Lini the Mog Knight by using a special Mission Item 
           known as The Hero Gaol. Lini starts off with Mog Guard and Ultima
           Charge.

Along with that, we have a few extras that can be collected by completing 
certain missions:

      Quin (Sage) ~
      =---------=
           You can get possibly Quin the Sage by clearing Mission #63 Missing 
           Prof. Quin starts off with Giga Flare and Ultima Blow.

[]---------------------------------------------------------------------------[]

With full credit given to http://www.ffcompendium.com/h/nchara.shtml, the 
names of FFTA actually bear some mythical and/or deep meaning. 

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]

===========
Adrammelech  
===========

A demon worshipped at Sepharvaim, an Assyrian town, where children were burned 
on his altar. It was usually represented under the shape of a mule, or 
sometimes, of a peacock. Some say that it was a combination of both, a mule 
with a peacock feather tail, because besides being though of as a very 
stubborn demon, Adramelech displayed pride in his position as the lord 
chancellor of Hell, 'Keeper of the Wardrobe of the Demon King' and president 
of Satan's private council, the High Council of the Devils. The name 
Adramelech (also Adrammalech) appears in the Old Testament only twice. The 
first time, he is mentioned as a son of the Assyrian King Sennacharib along 
with Sharezer, who murdered their father while he was worshiping in the temple 
of his idol, Nisrach. The second time Adramelech is mentioned is in the 
context of a Samarian sun god who was worshipped by the Sepharvites.

===========
Babus Swain
===========

Babus is probably derived from Babier/babied, which means "Of or having to do 
with a baby," which would most likely be Mewt. Swain has Icelandic roots from 
Svenn, which means a servant.

======
Exodus
======

Means "mass departure." There's a book in the Old Testament called this, 
referring to the Jews' exodus. 

============
Ezel Berbier
============

Ezel is from the bible and means to "walk/go abroad". Ezel is perhaps a Dutch 
word meaning 'donkey' which symbolizes stubborness and endurance. Berbier is 
perhaps Greek for "barbaric."

======
Hanzou
======

In Japanese history, there is such a man named Hattori Hanzo who lived in the 
mid to late 16th Century, and is considered to be the "most famous of Ninjas 
of Iga". His nickname was "Devil Hanzo" because of the tactics he used such as 
night raids on enemy strongholds. He is also a character in SNK's Samurai 
Spirits (aka Samurai Shodown outside Japan) fighting game series.

============
Llednar Twem
============

"Mewt Randell" backwards.

======
Mateus
======

English form of Matthaios, which was a Greek form of the Hebrew name 
Mattithyahu which meant "gift of God". Saint Matthew, also called Levi, was 
one of the twelve apostles (a tax collector). He was supposedly the author of 
the first Gospel in the New Testament. Kinda fits with the whole protector 
idea.

=========
Montblanc
=========

This is French for "white mountain." The real Mont Blanc, in the French Alps, 
is the highest mountain in Western Europe.

============
Ritz Malheur
============

"Malheur" is French for "bad hour." "Mal heure" would directly translate to 
bad hour, but "malheur" is a word which means "bad event" or something along 
those lines. Ritz means "To behave or live in an elegant, ostentatious 
manner". Kinda fitting given she dyes her hair.

      Version 0.1 - Completed portion of the walkthrough. A bunch of the guide
                    has been started although not completed. The items section
                    hasn't even been started yet. 178 KB

      Version 0.2 - Started up the Missions List in its entirity and completed
                    a bit more. As of today, all sections have been started,
                    although most aren't finished. 250 KB

      Version 0.3 - I have completed a lot for the Missions List. I still have
                    to finish (a) Walkthrough, (b) Missions, (c) Jobs List, (d)
                    Items List, (e) Clans List, and (f) Secet Characters. Now
                    that I reflect, I am still far from finishing... 273 KB

     Version 0.35 - At last, the Jobs List is finished! Now, onto the rest of
                    the FAQ. School is starting up soon and I really don't look
                    forward to it. 283 KB

      Version 0.4 - Some more additions to various sections. The Missions List
                    is shaping up nicely, along with the Clans List. 356 KB

      Version 0.5 - Heavy work on the Missions List. I actually completed more
                    than 100 of those. Only about 200 to go. As of late, this
                    FAQ is getting pretty big. 432 KB

      Version 0.6 - Finally reached the 500 KB mark. However, there is still
                    much to add. The Ability List is coming along nicely, and
                    some sections have taken some name changes. 500 KB

                    heavy overhaul. 610 KB

     Version 0.75 - Although it isn't near done yet, I am craving to finish.
                    However, I know it won't be that easy. 
                    679 KB

      Version 0.8 - Clans list completed. Items list nearly done. Abilities
                    list completed. And of course, the walkthrough and
                    missions list aren't near finished yet. Predict this
                    FAQ to be about 1000 KB when completed. 842 KB

     Version 0.85 - Missions List completed. A major milestone of the FAQ has
                    been finished. Alls I have to do now is brush up on the
                    remaining Monster Encyclopaedia along with a few entries
                    in the Items List to finish this once and for all. 895 KB

      Version 0.9 - Basically everything is complete with exception to the
                    walkthrough. The 1 MB mark has been broken. Expect this 
                    guide to be completed VERY soon. 1037 KB

     Version 0.95 - A few more missions to go and this guide is good as
                    finished. 1.05 MB

      Version 1.0 - All missions completed. With that done, the guide is
                    complete. Expect updates perhaps in the future. For now
                    however, I can finally take a break. 1.13 MB

      Version 1.1 - Added some Name Meanings courtesy of: 
                    http://www.ffcompendium.com/h/nchara.shtml 1.13 MB

      Version 1.2 - Ran the guide through a full spelling and grammar check.
                    Considering the size, it was quite a difficulty. =P
                    1.13 MB

      Version 1.3 - Added some more questions to the FAQ. 1.13 MB

      Version 1.4 - I missed some abilities in the job section. Fixed a bit of
                    that. 1.13 MB

http://www.ffcompendium.com/h/nchara.shtml - Insight on various names and their
                                             probable background. 

AstroBlue - AstroBlue's FFT-A guide was an amazing inspiration. Not to mention
            the fact that it had helped me play through FFT-A and master the
            game itself. Without it, I might have never had the motivation to
            complete FFT-A myself. 

Austin Self - He is the writer of the "Random Battle FAQ" you also see on 
              GameFAQs. Much thanks to Austin for providing me some information
              from his guide.

              titles along with other stellar RPGs including one of my all-
              time favorites, Chrono Trigger. 

Y.T.W.S.R. - Only a few selected people might know what I'm talking about here.
             Since I'm not one to give it away, I would still like to thank
             this group for their support and motivation throughout the 
             lifespan of this entire FAQ.

The FCSB - They didn't help too much but what can I say, where would I be

           Penguin, Gbness, Karpah, SinirothX, Meowthnum1, Guitarfreak86, 
           Joni Philips, War Doc, Merca, and last but definitely not least,
