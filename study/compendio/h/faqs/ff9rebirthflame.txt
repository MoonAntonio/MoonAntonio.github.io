Welcome to my third Final Fantasy IX FAQ listing the various locations of all 
100 cards in the game. This guide will not only help you find them but also
help you find them at the earliest time they are available. Using this guide 
it's possible for you to have 94 different cards before disc 4 with only
Ultima Weapon, Excalibur II, Mog, Bahamut, Leviathan and Hades missing from
your list.

This FAQ will go in card order and also so will the locations you can get
them starting from Alexandria on disc 1 to Memoria on disc 4. Whilst going
through this FAQ you might notice some people are listed more than once, this
is become depending on where you are in the game there cards will change.
Also you might notice a break in the list, this is to show a new area, place
and disc.
