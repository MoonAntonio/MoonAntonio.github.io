II.  Introduction to GFs
------------------------

This section will introduce you to the Guardian Forces of Final Fantasy VIII, commonly 
known as "GFs".  Read on to learn the basics of raising a GF.

---

- What is a GF? -

A GF is basically a summon "monster" (really a god or goddess or elemental).  They are 
known as "Summon Spells" from FFVII, "Espers" from FFVI, and "Summons" from FFV and 
FFIV.  You'll see a lot of the same GFs throughout the various FFs, such as Shiva and 
Ifrit, but a lot of them are new faces in FFVIII.

- How does a GF work? -

In Final Fantasy IV, V, VI, and VII, GFs (Espers/Summons, etc.) were really only super-
powerful Spells with flashy effects and animation.  FFVIII still has the flashy effects 
for these spells, but this game takes the concept of GFs one step further in that you 
can raise them to learn new abilities that can enhance the characters they are 
Junctioned to.  A GF, in essence, is a character in itself; it has its own Level, HP, 
and set of moves, and must be taken care of just like any party member.  When you call 
upon a GF in battle, a countdown will start and will reach zero faster or slower, 
depending on that character's Compatibility rating with the GF.  The GFs HP, for the 
time being, replace the character's HP, allowing it to absorb any damage done to the 
character.  Do remember, however, that GFs have a limited amount of HP, and if it's 
knocked out, it has to be revived using a special (but common) item.  Unlike party 
members, GFs quickly regain HP while you walk around, pretty much eliminating the need 
to keep a critical eye on their HP out of battle.  It's really not as hard as it sounds.

If you want a good comparison, think of GFs like super-powerful Pokémon - you have to 
take care of them in the same way, but they're much cooler.

- How do I raise my Compatibility with my GFs? -

A GFs Compatibility rating with a character determines how long it will take to answer 
their Junctioned member's call.  0 is the lowest, 1000 is the highest.  Try to get close 
to 1000 with most of your best GFs.  There is not much worse than being in a tough Boss 
battle and having to wait an eternity for your GF to appear.  The fastest way to raise 
the Compatibility with the GF is to simply summon it in battle; around 20 Points will be 
gained with each Summon.  Some Items can also be used to raise it by 1 to 3 Points.  
Using healing and revivial Items on your GFs can also make them like you more.  
Alternately, Compatibility can do down, too.  If you have two or more GFs on one 
character, and you summon one of them, the other ones are likely to go down 1 or 2 
Points sometimes, so keep this in mind when summoning GFs.

- How does a GF learn Abilities? -

This is simple.  First, at the GF Menu, you set an Ability for a GF to learn (whatever 
you wish).  Then, as you win battles, you will gain AP.  Once the GF has acquired enough 
AP to learn the Ability, you will get a message saying that it has been learned, and 
then you can choose a new Ability.

Learning some Abilities will unlock previously unavailable Abilities to learn.  For 
example, learning the Elem-Def-J Ability with a GF might unlock the Elem-Defx2 Ability 
to learn.

- How do you get GFs, anyway? -

Most of them are hidden and if you don't have a strategy guide and/or have a bad habit 
of not Drawing from EVERY MONSTER AND BOSS YOU FIGHT, you will probably miss most of 
them.  Some are given to you; most of them you have to Draw from Bosses, and some of 
them you have to find in secret side-quests.  Some of them you will have to fight before 
they join you.  Getting the GF is always worth it, though.

- How does a GF gain EXP and Level up? -

Just like any party member does.  For example, let's say you have Shiva junctioned to 
Squall.  Squall gets into a battle, wins, and gets 200 EXP.  Shiva also gains 200 EXP, 
and will Level Up when she reaches her "Next Level" EXP amount.  

Note that when two or more GFs are Junctioned to one character, the EXP gained will be 
divided among all GFs on the character.  So if Shiva and Quetzacoatl are both Junctioned 
to Squall, each of them will gain only 100 EXP.  This does NOT APPLY TO AP, however.

- What does Boost do?!? -

Boost, at a measly 10 AP, should be the first Ability you learn with any new GF.  Once 
you learn it, hold the Select button down during the GF animation and rapidly press the 
Square button.  Press it until the "X" appears in front of the finger on the screen, 
then stop.  Once the "X" disappears again, resume tapping as quickly as possible.  Keep 
doing this to boost the damage the GF does.  This is extremely useful, and should not be 
underestimated.

Name:            Ifrit
Element:         Fire
Attack Name:     Hell Fire
Starting Level:  Level 1

How to get it:   You will recieve Ifrit (as well as his Card) when you defeat him in   
                 the Fire Cavern at the beginning of the game.

Ifrit, the God of Fire, starts off weak (when compared to the stronger Shiva and 
Quetzacoatl at the beginning of the game), but becomes extremely powerful quickly after 
you start leveling him up.  His attack, Hell Fire, is especially effective against Ice-
Elemental enemies.

Name:            Siren
Element:         None, adds Silence
Attack Name:     Silent Voice
Starting Level:  Level 3

How to get it:   Draw it from Elvoret, the Boss that throws away Biggs and Wedge at 
                 the Dollet Communication Tower (the SeeD Field Exam).

This female GF is a unique one - it does not have an Elemental, and it's not 
exceptionally strong in attack power, but it provides its user with immense special 
powers through its St-Atk-J and St-Def-J Abilities, which are extremely useful early in 
the game and all throughout, as well.  Siren's attack, Silent Voice, sometimes Silences 
enemies which could make mincemeat out of potentially powerful enemy who relies on 
Magic.

Name:            Brothers
Element:         Earth
Attack Name:     Brotherly Love
Starting Level:  Level 7

How to get it:   Solve the drawbridge puzzle in the Tomb of the Unknown King.  For
                 an easy solution, take every right in the Tomb and you'll hit every     
                 important room in the tomb in the order you need to.  Once you     
                 defeat the Brothers, they'll join you and you'll also get their 
                 Cards.

These Earth beast brothers are a unique GF in that they are very weak initially, and 
aren't very strong for the most part, but are VERY strong against creatures with an 
Earth weakness.  Their GF animation is also one of the funniest in the game, so make 
sure you look at it at least once before you start Boosting it.

Name:            Diablos
Element:         None
Attack Name:     Dark Messenger
Starting Level:  Level 9

How to get it:   Speak with Headmaster Cid a second time after he sends you off to 
                 Timber and he will give an Item called the Magical Lamp.  Save your
                 game and then use it, and you will be transported to an alternate 
                 dimension where you'll automatically engage Diablos.  Beat him and
                 he will join you, and you'll get his Card.

Final Fantasy VIII's version of Satan (the Devil) is one of the most lethal GFs in the 
game.  At first, his attack, Dark Messenger, will do VERY little damage, but VERY 
quickly after it starts Leveling up, it will become MUCH stronger.  Try to get him to at 
least Level 50 as soon as you can, and become as compatible with him as possible.  
Diablos' attack is much like an enemy-all Demi; except that whatever Level he's 
currently at, he'll take that much HP away from his opponent.  For example, at Level 40, 
he'll drain 40% of all your opponents' max HP totals.  And at Level 100, well, can you 
say "guaranteed death"?  Keep in mind that a lot of Bosses are immune to Diablos, but 
not all of them.

Note: The maximum amount of damage that Diablos can do, period, is 9999.

Name:            Carbuncle
Element:         None, casts Reflect
Attack Name:     Ruby Light
Starting Level:  Level 16

How to get it:   Draw it from either one of the Iguions you fight during Edea's
                 Parade in Disc 1.

Carbuncle, a cute little Sprite-type spirit, is not an offensive GF, but rather a 
defensive one.  In a cool-looking spell called Ruby Light, he casts Reflect on all of 
your party members.  This, effectively, bounces spells like Fire, Fira, and Firaga back 
at the caster, but alternately bounces Cure spells off of you, too.  So use it sparingly 
and wisely, or you may end up not being able to heal yourself in a Boss fight.

Name:            Leviathan
Element:         Water
Attack Name:     Tsunami
Starting Level:  Level 17

How to get it:   Draw it from the Boss NORG at Balamb Garden in Disc 2.

The Water Dragon, Leviathan, is kind of a mixed package.  He is extremely powerful, but 
there are VERY few enemies with a Water-Elemental weakness; on the other hand, he has 
some VERY useful Abilities, such as Recover, which is one of the best in the game - it 
lets you restore a member's HP fully without the use of Magic, allowing you to use it 
even when you're Silenced.  Use Leviathan mainly against Fire-Elemental creatures and 
machines.

Name:            Pandemonia
Element:         Wind
Attack Name:     Tornado Zone
Starting Level:  Level 19

How to get it:   Draw it from the Boss, Fujin, in Balamb during Disc 2.

The Wind spirit Pandemonia, like Leviathan, is also a mixed package.  Unlike Leviathan, 
Pandemonia isn't very powerful offensive-wise.  I think I used him twice after I got him 
in the whole game; however, he has wonderful Abilities, especially his Strength and 
Speed Junctions.  Definitely use him, if only for Junctioning.  Pandemonia's attack, 
Tornado Zone, is most effective against Water-Elemental creatures.

Name:            Cerberus
Element:         None, casts Double and Triple
Attack Name:     Counter Rockets
Starting Level:  Level 23

How to get it:   You will find Cerberus waiting in the yellow light in the center of 
                 Galbadia Garden's main hall, during the end of Disc 2.  Talk to him 
                 to fight him.  Beat him and you will get him as a GF.

Cerberus, the three-headed demon dog from Hell, is arguably one of the most useful GFs 
in the game.  It doesn't do any damage to enemies, but its attack, Counter Rockets, 
casts Double AND Triple on ALL of your characters, effectively giving you a major 
advantage over your enemies.  Cerberus will come to be a major help in Boss fights, and 
sometimes, it may be the only way you can win.

Name:            Alexander
Element:         Holy
Attack Name:     Holy Judgement
Starting Level:  Level 25

How to get it:   Draw it from Edea during the final battle of Disc 2.

Alexander, a giant, menacing, cool-looking robot of Light can hit all enemies, and he 
can hit them hard.  His attack, Holy Judgement, not only looks cool, but will severely 
damage all undead/dark enemies, and will hurt anything else badly (except for Holy-
Elemental creatures).  Additionally, Alexander's Abilities rock, and are actually 
necessary to get the GF Doomtrain.  Make sure to get Revive, which acts like the Spell 
Full-Life, as soon as you can!

Name:            Doomtrain
Element:         Poison, adds various Status Ailments
Attack Name:     Runaway Train
Starting Level:  Level 28

How to get it:   Go to Tears' Point near Esthar and pick up the Solomon Ring.  Now,
                 collect 6 Steel Pipes, 6 Remedy+, and 6 Malboro Tentacles.  You can
                 get the Steel Pipes from Wendigos, Remedy+ from Alexander's Med LV 
                 Up Ability, and the Malboro Tentacles from Malboros.  Once you've
                 collected these Items, use the Solomon Ring and you will recieve
                 Doomtrain as another GF.

If you're a Final Fantasy veteran, you may recognize Doomtrain as a Boss from Final 
Fantasy VI (III U.S).  Doomtrain is easily one of the best GFs in the game; it looks 
cool, makes all enemies' Defense Power 0, and causes several Status Ailments like 
Poison, Blind, Stop, and Slow.  Doomtrain, also, is quite strong against most all 
enemies and Bosses (even the Final Boss!), has high HP, and has some of the best 
Abilities in the game.  Getting him is difficult, but be sure to do it!

Name:            Bahamut
Element:         None
Attack Name:     Mega Flare
Starting Level:  Level 35

How to get it:   You can find Bahamut in the Deep Sea Research Center (a side
                 quest).  Make your way to the blue capsule in the first room and
                 Bahamut will ask you a series of questions.  After each one, you'll
                 have to face a tough Ruby Dragon.  After the third question, he
                 will fight you.  Defeat him, and you will recieve him as a GF.  The
                 answers to his questions are "It is not our will to fight", 
                 "Never", and then the hidden option below the second option.
                 Answer incorrectly, and you will have to fight a Ruby Dragon and
                 THEN answer the question again.  Fun.  ^_^

Bahamut, the Dragon King, is unfortunately, much weaker than you might expect.  His 
Attack Power is that of Quetzacoatl's, and that means weak (compared to the likes of the 
later GFs such as Leviathan and Doomtrain).  Fortunately, Bahamut's attack animation is 
very long and allows you to Boost Bahamut close to the 250 maximum, making him much 
stronger.  Bahamut's big advantage, though, is is arsenal of Abilities; some of the best 
in the game belong to Bahamut.  Additionally, Bahamut's attack, Mega Flare, ignores all 
additional or special defense, making it so his power doesn't ever go down.  Make sure

Name:            Cactuar
Element:         None
Attack Name:     1,000 Needles
Starting Level:  Level 20

How to get it:   You can find the GF Cactuar on Cactuar Island, a small island to 
                 the south of Esthar.  You will know the island by the appearance
                 of a randomly placed, small green dot in the sand.  That dot is the
                 Jumbo Cactuar, a giant Cactuar.  Walk up to him to engage him in 
                 combat.  To defeat him, use Water-Elemental attacks (especially
                 Leviathan) and strong Limit Breaks (especially Renzokuken).  He
                 will randomly counterattack with a move called 10,000 Needles that
                 kills a character instantly no matter what; counter this with Life,
                 Full-Life and Alexander's Revive.  Once you beat on him enough, you
                 will see a message that Jumbo Cactuar "is hesitating".  At this
                 point, DO NOT ATTACK or he will run away and you'll have to start
                 over!  Just summon Leviathan and have your Limit Breaks ready and
                 unload on him with EVERYTHING YOU HAVE.  If you're lucky, he'll
                 fall and you will get the Cactuar GF.

Cactuar is a GREAT GF.  His attack is extremely powerful; his Attack Power is directly 
correlated to his Level.  If he is Level 40, he'll do 4000 damage to any enemy, Boss, or 
Final Boss, regardless of special defense.  He also has VERY good Abilities.  Getting 
him is also a cinch (Jumbo Cactuar isn't so hard).  And, needless to say, his attack 
looks cool and needs no Boosting!  Have fun with him!

Name:            Tonberry
Element:         None
Attack Name:     Chef's Knife
Starting Level:  Level 30

How to get it:   You can find the GF Tonberry at the Centra Ruins.  Tonberry, 
                 arguably, is the hardest GF to get in Final Fantasy VIII.  At the
                 first area of the Centra Ruins, you will find only Tonberry
                 enemies.  Your job is to defeat 18 to 22 Tonberries to make the
                 Tonberry King appear.  Sounds easy, right?  Trust me, it isn't.
                 Tonberries have around 20000 HP apiece, an attack called Chef's 
                 Knife that does 3000-4000 damage quickly, and a random counter-
                 attack called Everyone's Grudge that does about 5000-6000 damage to
                 a single character.  You'll need an edge.  First off, summon
                 Diablos.  Then, summon Cerberus.  Then, cast Protect on everyone.
                 Finally, pound away with Diablos until it dies.  If you get
                 dangerously low on HP, cast Curaga or use Recover.  Once you defeat
                 the right number of Tonberries, the Tonberry King will replace the
                 last fallen Tonberry without giving you a chance to heal.  He is
                 much faster and stronger than normal Tonberries, and if you die,
                 you have to start all over.  Once you beat him, you get the 
                 Tonberry GF.  Oh, and did I mention you get 0 EXP and 1 AP for
                 defeating a single Tonberry?  Heh heh heh.  ^_^

Tonberry's attack, Chef's Knife, is generally pretty weak - about as powerful as 
Quetzacoatl, but only on a single enemy.  Also, the animation is very short and allows 
for almost no Boosting.  However, the attack does ignore defense.  Tonberry's major 
prize is his unique Abilities, all of which rock.  Be sure to learn all of his shop 
Abilities!  Oh, and enjoy the animation - it's hilarious.

Name:            Eden
Element:         None
Attack Name:     Eternal Breath
Starting Level:  Level 30

How to get it:   The final GF in Final Fantasy VIII, Eden, is easily the most
                 powerful in the game, so you know you want it.  Eden can be found
                 in the Deep Sea Research Center, after defeating Bahamut.  Work
                 your way to the bottom of the ruins, solving the puzzles as you go
                 along, until you finally reach the very tough Boss, Ultima Weapon.
                 You can draw Eden from Ultima Weapon, and if you survive, you get
                 to keep him.

Eden's attack, Eternal Breath, is simply the most powerful GF attack in the game.  Keep 
in mind, though, that it is not THE most powerful attack in the game - Squall's 
Renzokuken coupled with the Lion Heart Limit Break is.  Even so, Eden is a great asset 
to have in a fight.  He also has some cool Abilities, but nothing that stands out.  
Eden's attack animation is exceptionally long, and easily allows for Boosting to the 
full 250 maximum.  This usually makes the attack do about 35000 damage to all enemies.  
But, in all honesty, I used Eden once to see the ultra-cool animation, and that was it.  
Squall's Limit Break is much more effective.
