Author's Notes:
Hello, and welcome to version 2.2 of "An Unofficial Final Fantasy VIII
Walkthrough", which covers both the U.S and Japanese releases of this
epic RPG. Well, it's been quite a while since this guide began as a
tiny FAQ for the trial edition of FF VIII in July of 1998, and I think
it's time I called it quits. As such, this revision will be the last;
I'll like to thank everyone who wrote in.

I recommend that you view this document in a font with a fixed width
such as courier, as the layout for this FAQ has been optimized in using
the courier font.

5n). Each individual event in the Walkthrough section has also been

[Introduction]
A graduate from the world famous military school, Garden, Squall meets
a mysterious young girl at a campus party. Her carefree nature gradually
influences Squall, a cold-hearted young man who rejects the presence of
others. In a sudden twist of fate, the nation of Galbadia declares war
on the entire world... standing by the Galbadian President as he makes
his speech is a sorceress, a symbol long forgotten from the memories of
the people...


[Characters]
Final Fantasy VIII offers a wide cast of characters who play various 
roles in this epic saga. Appearing in no particular order:

Squall Leonhart
Age: 17
Sex: Male
Height: 177 cm (5'8")
Blood type: AB
Birthdate: August 23rd
Weapon: Gunblade

The main character of ff 8, Squall is a short-spoken and emotionless 
young man. A student of Balamb Garden, he's an introvert with little 
concern for his comrades; few can actually claim to understand him. A 
cold and mysterious guy.

Limit Break: Renzokuken
Squall launches into an array of slashes, and sometimes finishes off 
his 'Renzokuken' with a spectacular blow, which varies accordingly to 
the type of Gunblade he's carrying.

During his Limit Break sequence, a Special gauge will appear; hit R1
when the moving yellow beacon enters the 2nd to left bracket for double
damage. His finishing blow appears at RANDOM, so don't worry too much
about it. Squall acquires up to 4 finishing blows in the entire game.
Literally translated, Renzokuken means Sequential Blade.

 -SPECIAL------------------------------------------------
 |       | Press  |                      # Moving #     |
 |       | 'R1'   |                <---  # yellow #     |
 |       | here   |                      # beacon #     |
 --------------------------------------------------------

You can choose to set this feature on 'Auto' in Squall's status screen.

<Finishing Blows>

 Rough Divide: Squall charges at a single enemy and performs an
               upward slice.
 Available to: All Gunblades.

 Fated Circle: Squall releases an energy wave while in mid-air with
               his Gunblade, which targets all enemies.
 Available to: Shear Trigger Gunblade upwards.

Blasting Zone: Squall's Gunblade forms a gigantic beam pillar that
               smashes all opponents.
 Available to: Flame Saber Gunblade upwards.

   Lion Heart: Squall slashes a single target 18 times, doing heavy
               damage with each cut. The Lion Heart move was termed
               'End of Heart' in the Japanese version.
 Available to: Lionheart Gunblade.

As you upgrade his Gunblade, more finishing moves are opened up.
Lion Heart's probably the strongest attack in the entire game. Refer
to the Appendix section for a list detailing weapon remodeling.


Rinoa Heartilly
Age: 17
Sex: Female
Height: 163 cm (5'4")
Blood type: Unknown
Birthdate: March 3rd
Weapon: Blaster Edge

Final Fantasy 8's female lead, Rinoa, is both angelic and bubbly. She 
loves to speak her mind, and has the habit of acting on impulse. Rinoa 
and Squall met during one of SeeD's inauguration parties.

Limit Breaks: Combine / Angel Wing (Varly)
Rinoa summons Angelo, her pet dog. She's capable of dealing out 
several unique attacks. Angelo learns new tricks when Rinoa reads 'Pet
Pals'. The respective skill then appears in Rinoa's 'Specials' window. 

Learning a new skill is done by highlighting it with the arrow; the 
more steps Rinoa takes, the more the bar fills up. A trick is 
considered to be learnt when the bar is fully filled, and a ring will
sound to indicate this. For a complete listing of Pet Pals locations,
refer to the Appendix section.

<Angelo's Tricks>

Angelo Rush: Random counter-attack, Angelo charges at a single foe.
             (Learnt Trick)
Angelo Recover: Randomly restores HP to a weakened party member.
                (Learnt in Pet Pals Vol. 2)
Angelo Reverse: Randomly restores a KO'ed party member.
                (Learnt in Pet Pals Vol. 4)
Angelo Search: Randomly finds items on the battlefield.
               (Learnt in Pet Pals Vol. 5)
Angelo Cannon: Resultant explosion hits all enemies.
               (Learnt Trick)
Angelo Strike: Sends a single target crashing onto the ground.
               (Learnt in Pet Pals Vol. 1)
Invincible Moon: Puts entire party in Invincible status.
                 (Learnt in Pet Pals Vol. 3)
Wishing Star: Shooting stars devastate all foes several times.
              (Learnt in Pet Pals Vol. 6)

Angel Wing will only become available in Disc Three; in this mode Rinoa
is controlled by the computer and can only cast random spells, all of
which hit for maximum results.


Seifer Almasy
Age: 18
Sex: Male
Height: 188 cm (6'2")
Blood type: O
Birthdate: December 22nd
Weapon: Gunblade

Seifer is gifted with natural fighting abilities, but his eagerness for 
victory and impatience makes him one of Balamb Garden's problematic 
students. He is aware of Squall's capability, and views him fiercely as 
a rival.

Limit Break: Fire Cross (Shimatsusuken)
Seifer casts a spell on the enemy, then gathers energy upon his Gun 
-blade before unleashing multiple energy arcs which home in on their 
targets, leaving spectacular green trails behind them.


Zell Dincht
Age: 17
Sex: Male
Height: 168 cm (5'5")
Blood type: B
Birthdate: March 17th
Weapon: Gloves

Young and brash Zell aspires to be just like his grandfather, a famous 
military figure. His ambitions made him enter Balamb Garden at the age 
of 13. Zell doesn't give in without a fight, however his actions make 
him appear somewhat immature and rash.

Limit Break: Duel
Zell displays his hand-to-hand prowess with a dazzling combo of skills.
All of them are performed SF-style under a timer. Zell gains new skills
via collecting issues of 'Combat King'. He may also learn some of his
special moves when he reaches higher levels.

When the window appears, enter the commands quickly in the given time
period and a new window should appear. Trigger any one of the moves
within, and keep at it until you see his finishing move command flashing
in the window. Perform that to end a successful 'Duel'. This feature
can be set on 'Auto' in Zell's status screen.

<Duel Moves>

Rush Punch: O , X  (Learnt)
Booya: Right , Left  (Learnt)
Heel Drop: Up , Down  (Learnt)
Mach Kick: Left , Left , O  (Learnt)
Dolphin Blow: L1 , R1 , L1 , R1  (CK 001)
Meteor Strike: Down , O , Up , O  (CK 002)

%Different Beat: T , S , X , O , Up  (CK 004)
%My Final Heaven: Up , Right , Down , Left , T  (CK 005)

'%' denotes finishing moves. Regardless of the amount of time left,
once such a move is performed, Zell is forced to end 'Duel' pre
-maturely. Try to fit in a few more normal moves before that if you
can. For a complete listing of Combat King locations, refer to the
Appendix section.

Quistis Trepe
Age: 18
Sex: Female
Height: 172 cm (5'6")
Blood type: A
Birthdate: October 4th
Weapon: Chain Whip

Orphaned at the age of 5, Quistis joined Garden at 10 and officially 
became a member of SeeD when she reached 15. She's a good mentor 
towards Squall. Quistis is one who's not used to setbacks, and demands 
only the best from herself.

Limit Break: Blue Magic (Enemy Skills)
Quistis draws from her massive collection of enemy skills to unleash 
upon her opponents. Unlike the rest, Quistis learns new skills via 
special items dropped by (or stolen from) her defeated opponents.
Use these items on Quistis in your inventory screen.

<Blue Magic>

              and Float.

For a complete listing of all Blue Magic locations, refer to the
Appendix section.


Irvine Kinneas
Age: 17
Sex: Male
Height: 185 cm (6'0")
Blood type: A
Birthdate: November 24th
Weapon: Shot Gun

Irvine is full of confidence of himself and his shooting skills are 
matched by none. He hails from Galbadia Garden, and calls himself 
'Garden's Elite Sharpshooter'. Easy-going and humourous, Irvine's 
also a big flirt.

Limit Break: Shot
Irvine selects from his collection of special ammo and unleashes it 
upon his opponents. Hit R1 repeatedly to fire his gun. Bullets are
purchased from stores, obtained from enemies or received via 'Ammo
Refinement' and 'Card Mod.' menu abilities. Each type of ammunition
has its own unique element.

<Ammunition>

Normal Ammo: Standard damage to single target.
             (1 Screw = 8 Normal Ammo)
Shotgun Ammo: Standard damage to all targets.
Fast Ammo: Low damage to all targets. Extremely quick firing rate.
           (1 Normal Ammo or Shotgun Ammo = 1 or 2 Fast Ammo 
            respectively)
Fire Ammo: Moderate to high fire-typed damage to all targets.
           (1 Fuel, 1 Bomb Fragment or 1 Red Fang = 10, 20 or 40
            Fire Ammo respectively)
Dark Ammo: Standard status-changing damage to single target.
           (1 Poison Powder or 1 Venom Fang = 10 or 20 Dark Ammo
            respectively)
Demolition Ammo: Heavy damage to single target. Slow firing rate.
                 (1 Missile, 1 Running Fire or 1 Cactus Thorn = 20,
                  40 or 40 Demolition Ammo respectively)
AP Ammo: Heavy damage to single target. Average firing rate.
         (1 Sharp Spike or 1 Chef's Knife = 10 or 20 AP Ammo
          respectively)
Pulse Ammo: Maximum damage to single target. Average firing rate.
            (1 Laser Cannon, 1 Energy Crystal or 1 Power Generator
             = 5, 10 or 20 Pulse Ammo respectively)

When the blue bar in the bottom right corner depletes, 'Shot' ends.
You can also end it prematurely by pressing the cancel button. This
helps when the enemy's already dead, which is indicated when your
shots start doing zero damage.


Selphie Tilmitt
Age: 17
Sex: Female
Height: 157 cm (5'2")
Blood type: B
Birthdate: July 16th
Weapon: Nunchaku

A student of Trabia Garden, Selphie is known to be responsible yet 
naive in her thinking. She's playful and child-like, but overall 
Selphie's comfortable to be with.

Limit Break: Slot
Selphie casts a random spell from her slot machine. When this window 
appears, the 1st option, 'Do Over' lets you scroll through the spells
randomly; the 2nd, 'Cast' makes Selphie cast it, often with doubled
or tripled results. Remember that time runs while you're selecting
spells, so be quick.

<Exclusive Spells>

Full-Cure: Completely restores all members' HPs.
Wall: Endows party members with Protect and Shell.
Rapture: Takes the target away from battle. Useless against bosses
         and flying monsters.
The End: Eliminates practically any enemy (including bosses!). Useless
         against undeads and the final boss. 'The End' appears very
         rarely.

Your chances of using a rare spell increases when Selphie's HP is low,
and when she has a high Luck rating.


Fujin 
Age: 17
Sex: Female
Height: Unknown
Blood type: Unknown
Birthdate: Unknown
Weapon: Pin Wheel

Tomboyish, emotionless and quiet, Fujin exhibits a tough demeanour 
equaling that of any man. She also has a habit of speaking entirely 
in short, curt sentences.


Raijin
Age: 18
Sex: Male
Height: Unknown
Blood type: Unknown
Birthdate: Unknown
Weapon: Staff

Loud-spoken, rash and unrefined, Raijin is the exact opposite of his
sister. Both of them work under Seifer in Balamb Garden in the
Disciplinary Committee.


Laguna Loire
Age: 27
Sex: Male
Height: 181 cm (5'9")
Blood type: B
Birthdate: March 1st
Weapon: Machine Gun

A man with a strong sense of justice, Laguna believes in protecting 
the weak. Formerly a soldier, he's now a journalist with Timber Maniacs, 
having decided to trade in his sword for a pen. Optimistic and cheerful, 
Laguna is very much a people's person.

Limit Break: Desperado
Laguna hurls a grenade at the enemy, leaps and latches onto a rope 
while opening continuous fire with his Machine Gun, and ends his Limit 
Break with the detonation of the grenade, throwing the enemy sky-high.
Causes damage to all targets.


Ward Zabac
Sex: Male
Age: 25
Height: 217 cm (7'0")
Blood type: A
Birthdate: February 25th
Weapon: Harpoon

Tough-talking and ominous, Ward sports a scar (which seems to be all 
the rage nowadays in ff 8) and a big, mean harpoon. Not someone you'll 
want to agitate. He's pretty at ease with his pals, Laguna and Kiros 
though.

Limit Break: Massive Anchor
Ward hurls his harpoon into the air, leaps up to retrieve it, then 
pierces the enemies with a downward thrust, causing a massive explosion.
Affects all enemies.


Kiros Seagill
Age: 23
Sex: Male
Height: 191 cm (6'3")
Blood type: O
Birthdate: July 6th
Weapon: Katals

Looking much more refined than his fellow counterpart Ward, Kiros 
formerly served in the Galbadian army, with katals as his weapon. Both
Ward and him have a very good working relationship with Laguna.

Limit Break: Blood Pain
Kiros goes into a slashing frenzy with his katals, approximately
cutting the enemy 7 to 8 times. Critical hits appear at random. Single
target.


Edea
Age: Unknown
Sex: Female
Height: Unknown
Blood type: Unknown
Birthdate: Unknown
Weapon: Sorcery

Not much is known about her, but supposedly she's a sorceress bent on 
creating trouble. Edea is said to be the mastermind behind Galbadia's 
world domination plans, and has shocked the world with her return... 
sorceresses were thought to be extinct previously.


Cid Kramer
Age: Unknown
Sex: Male
Height: Unknown
Blood type: Unknown
Birthdate: Unknown

This lovable character once again makes an appearance, this time as 
the headmaster of Balamb Garden! He's well-liked by students for his
kindly nature and friendly student policies. Cid tends to be a little 
long-winded this time round, and contrary to previous Cids, he has 
trouble dealing with mechanics initially.

        icon appears, and stop when a red cross appears over the 
        finger. You can increase your G.F.'s power if you do it right /

[Getting Started]
The 2 choices that appear when you start up the game are 'New Game' and 
'Continue' respectively. If you're continuing a game from saved data,
take the 2nd option. Otherwise, move the cursor to 'New Game' and hit
'X' (U.S) or 'Circle' (Japanese) to proceed.

[Changing Discs]
The game will prompt you when you need to insert a new disc. Do this
by opening the CD cover (there's no need to switch off the power) of
the PlayStation, replacing the disc inside with the required one, and
closing the cover.


[Gameplay Basics]
Below are some of the basic systems and events in the world of ff 8.

<Saving>
Save often; this enables you to resume play at an earlier point should
you fail in battle or in certain game events. The Save command (found in
the Menu screen) is used to record a position on the Overworld or on a
Save Point. The latter are found as blue and orange bands of light 
orbiting around a black orb. You need a Memory Card peripheral, which
is sold separately, to save your game.

<Viewing the World Map>
A reduced world map/sphere (press 'Select' to switch between them) is
shown in the bottom-right corner of the Overworld. In this map, the
direction Squall is facing will be represented by a cone-shaped
yellow beam. The red dot shows Squall's current location. 

<Exploring Towns>
There're various establishments in the world of ff 8. The following are
some of them:

HOTELS
Spend a night here to recover the HPs of your party members and G.Fs.
Characters affected by abnormal status are also cured. Hotels usually
house Save Points.

CAR RENTAL SHOPS
Cars can be rented for 3,500 gil here. They allow you to travel on the 
Overworld quickly while keeping enemy encounters non-existent. Note
that you'll need fuel to actually drive one properly.

TRAIN STATIONS
Trains provide a convenient way of shuttling between major cities. A
ticket costs 3,000 gil.

SHOPS
You can pick various restorative items, fuel, ammunition and the
occasional book from them. They'll also offer to buy any excess items
you have in your inventory list. 

JUNK STORES
They specialise in remodeling your weapons.

PET STORES
You'll find a wide assortment of items for your G.Fs and issues of Pet 
Pals here.

<Remodeling your Weapons>
In ff 8, Square has done away with armours completely, leaving only 
weapons which can be remodeled. This is done via collecting raw 
materials such as Screws and Steel Pipes by defeating (or stealing 
from) enemies, then visiting Junk Stores -- they specialise in 
upgrading your weapons. Throughout the course of the game you will 
come across Weapons Monthly magazines; these detail the specific raw
materials needed to remodel a particular weapon.

<Spells>
The MP (Magic Points) system which has graced the Final Fantasy series
for so long has all but disappeared in ff 8. Rather, spells behave
more like items now, with limited usage of each spell, i.e. Laguna may
have only 20 'Fire' spells in his magic list, which means he can
only cast 'Fire' 20 times before it runs out. To replenish this
stock of spells, you must draw them either from enemies in combat via
the 'Draw' command, or depend on...

<Draw Points>
Treasure chests are non-existent in ff 8; they've been replaced by Draw
Points, special locations from where you can gain magic spells for free 
from. Draw Points recover after a certain period of time has elapsed.
They're found as purple bands bonded together to form a sphere.
Some Draw Points never recover themselves; you can identify them when
they turn blue after they've been drawn from.

<Guardian Forces>
Guardian Forces are summoned creatures that join in on your quest.
Unlike the previous Final Fantasies, they play a much greater role in
ff 8; they form the foundations of any character, and determine the
person's capability in battle. Of course, G.Fs are still a force to be
reckoned with in combat, and many familiar summon monsters have made
a return in ff 8.

***<The new Junction System>***
A new system involving spells and G.Fs has been created in ff 8: the
Junction System. This will be your main source of powering up your
party members in ff 8; refer to the Menu Tutorial section below for
more details. This new system is *extremely* important, so make sure
you take time to learn it!


========================================================================
III. M E N U   T U T O R I A L
========================================================================

[The Menu Screen]
Pushing the 'Circle' (U.S) or 'Triangle' (Japanese) button out of battle
brings up the menu screen. Twelve commands can be issued from here. In
addition, the menu screen also provides gameplay information such as
your current location (check the bottom-left window) and your playing
time, SeeD rank, plus total amount of Gil (the form of currency in ff 8)
in the bottom-right window.

The window in the upper-right consists of 11 commands. Reading from
top to bottom, they're: Junction, Item, Magic, Status, G.F., Abilities,
Switch, Cards, Configuration, Tutorial and finally Save.


[Junction]
The Junction system combines both the Materia and Job system together, 
enabling you to build the kind of character you want. It does this by
allowing spells themselves to double as character-building elements.
I'll give a brief diagram of how the Junction Screen looks like:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
|Notice    JUNCTION      OFF      AUTO     ABILITIES       | JUNCTION |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
|Help Window                                                          |

|Spirit       --                     Luck          --                 |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
*S Attack and S Def.: Status Attack and Status Defense
 E Attack and E Def.: Elemental Attack and Elemental Defense
 (they'll be highlighted if junctioning spells to them is possible)

In a nutshell, here's how the whole thing works:

1. Gain G.Fs through drawing from bosses, receiving as gifts or 
   defeating the G.Fs themselves. Open up the menu screen.

2. Junction a GF (a character can have multiple GFs junctioned) to a
   party member by selecting 'Junction', and then 'GF.'. Press
   'X' (U.S) or 'Circle' (Japanese) to equip a GF. GFs already
   junctioned will be indicated by a symbol next to their names. Hit
   'Triangle' (U.S) or 'X' (Japanese) when you're done equipping.
   If you already have a stock of spells in that particular character's
   spells list, jump straight to point 4. Otherwise, ignore the 
   'Auto' window which pops up, equip the 'Draw' command ability
   under the 'Abilities' window, then proceed onto point 3.

3. Draw spells for junctioning from enemies or Draw Points. Different
   spells have varying effects on the same parameter. You can have
   a maximum of 100 for each type of spell. Once you've amassed enough
   spells, select the 'Auto' command in the Junction sub-screen.

4. Choose to optimize your character, based either on 'Attack', 
   'Magic' or 'Defense':
   Attack: Places emphasis on 'Strength' parameter
   Magic: Places emphasis on 'Magic' parameter
   Defense: Places emphasis on 'HP' parameter (not Vitality rating!)

5. Select the abilities you want available to your character.

6. If you're not happy with the junctioned magic spells, choose 
   'Junction' again, and then 'Magic'. Change the spells if you want, 
   or remove them with 'Square'.
   Alternatively, the 'Off' command works well if you wish to
   de-equip all junctioned spells (select 'Magic') or all G.Fs, spells
   and abilities (select 'All').
   If your character has the ability to junction spells to Elemental
   Attack/Defense or Status Attack/Defense, use the d-pad to scroll
   the junction screen left. The higher the amount of spells (max. 100)
   junctioned to a parameter, the better the effect.

7. From the menu screen, select G.F. Tap 'X' (U.S) or 'Circle'
   (Japanese) at a G.F's status window, and select the ability you want
   it to learn. Abilities are divided into six different types:
   Junction, Command, Character, Party, G.F. and Menu.

8. Each ability takes up varying amounts of AP to learn. APs are earned
   after battles. You should select the types of abilities to master
   according to your situation.

<Abilities Details>
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Again, I can't begin to stress on the importance of the Junction System
in ff 8. If you really want to survive some of the tougher bosses in
this game, then it is vital you MASTER this system!


[Item]
This command is primarily used for curing your party, and tinkering
with the abilities of your G.Fs. You have access to a total of 4 
choices. Reading from left to right, they're:

Use: Select this to use the items present in your inventory list. Items
     which are unusable will be displayed in grey. Press left or right
     on the d-pad to scroll through the list of items. There're a
     variety of items in ff 8; you can only carry 100 of each type.

Rearrange: Lets you arrange your items in the order you prefer.

Sort: The computer arranges your items for you automatically.

Battle: Arranges the lineup of items when the 'Item' command is used
        in battle.

Un-wanted items cannot be discarded; either use them in battle to get
rid of them, or sell them (more practical) to shops.


[Magic]
The Magic command allows you to cure your party (provided you have the
correct type of spells) as well as to arrange and swap spells among
the party members. Reading from left to right, the 4 choices here are:

Use: Lets you cast a particular heal-typed spell. In ff 8, you cannot
     target multiple members with a single spell, so you'll have to
     cure each character separately. There're a variety of spells in
     ff 8; you can only carry 100 of each type in a character's
     spells list.

Exchange: Allows you to manually swap spells between party members.
          - 'Give All' transfers an entire spell type to the member
            in the lower row.
          - 'Take All' transfers an entire spell type to the member
            in the upper row.
          - 'Split' enables you to specify the amount of spells to
            be swapped.

All: Swaps an entire set of spells list between party members.

Rearrange: Lets you determine the placement of spells when the 'Magic'
           command is used in battle.

There's really no easy way to discard un-wanted spells in the Japanese
version. You can either cast them in battle (summon G.F Cerberus
beforehand for an easier time), or use menu abilities such as G.F.
Quezacotl's Mid. Magic Refinement to get rid of some of the weaker
variations of magics.

In the U.S version, spells can be discarded by placing the cursor over
them and pressing 'Square'.


[Status]
Execute this command to learn about a character's current condition.
Apart from his or her name, current level (a yellowish insignia beside
this indicates that the particular member is in your main party), HP
(Health or Hit Points) values, current Experience and the amount of
Experience Points required to advance to the next level, equipped
abilities and weapon, the Status sub-menu also displays the party 
member's status values:

(note: You can switch between characters using R1 or L1)

Strength: Capability to do         Speed: Rate at which ATB fills
          damage.                         during battle. 
Vitality: Resistance to physical   Luck: Deciding factor for speed of 
          attacks.                       escaping, items dropped,
                                         no. of spells drawn, etc.
Magic: Determines the              Evasion%: Ability to avoid attacks
       magnitude of spells.                  completely.
Spirit: Resistance to magical      Hit%: Hit rate for current weapon
        attacks.

Pressing the 'X' (U.S) or 'Circle' (Japanese) button brings up the
Elemental Attack, Elemental Defense, Status Attack and Status Defense
ratings of that character.

Hitting the button another time brings up the G.F. affiliation chart
for that party member. Refer to the G.F. sub-section below for details
as to what this chart means.

Finally, tapping the same button again displays the Limit Breaks
list of that character. Alternatively, this list can also be displayed
by simply pressing 'Square'.

For Squall and Zell, you can set their Limit Breaks on auto (the
computer takes care of the button pressing), but I advise you ignore
this feature, seeing how the computer misses the timings so often.
Besides, it's more fun to do it by yourself ^_^


[G.F.]
The G.F. screen shows the stats of your acquired summon monsters. Hit
R1 or L1 to scroll between G.Fs. Pressing 'X' (U.S) or 'Circle'
(Japanese) at a G.F's status screen brings up its abilities list.
Each G.F can only learn up to 22 abilities in its natural course,
unless you decide to tinker with them using certain G.F ability items.

G.Fs learn abilities by gaining AP (Ability Points) or using items.
They can also raise their HP and power via levelling up or certain
abilities. However, unlike AP, G.Fs in battle SHARE the EXP the
character which they've been junctioned to receives, i.e. if Squall
has both Quezacotl and Shiva junctioned, and receives 300 EXP
plus 8 AP at the end of a fight, each of the 2 G.Fs gain 150 EXP
and 8 AP.

You might want to de-equip the stronger G.Fs for a while if you want
to build up weaker ones. And mind you, new G.Fs often start off
pathetically weak. Every G.F. takes 500 EXP to gain a level, with the
exception of the 16th and final G.F, Eden (1,000 EXP).

G.Fs also have different mindsets towards each character (the red bar 
along with the numbers in the G.F. screen indicate how much they like 
each member). The higher the value, the lesser the time it takes to 
summon them. This value is increased by summoning them, or casting 
spells of the same element as the G.F, i.e. Fire spells raise Ifrit's 
opinion of the character. Likewise, if you use Blizzard spells, you'll
lower Ifrit's rating towards the member but raise Shiva's affection.

Another ability I'll like to highlight here is the 'Boost' G.F. 
ability, or 'Ouen'. As mentioned in the Basic System section, this 
comes into play during the summoning sequences (hold Select, then tap 
Square at the correct times) for certain G.Fs. Normally, G.Fs use only 
100% of their strength during a summon.

However, the 'Boost' ability actually drops this back to 75%, but you
can raise it to 250% if you're a quick tapper, or have a turbo
controller on hand. It's just an element of risk undertaken in using
'Boost'. Credit goes to Adam for this bit of info. If you're reading
this, thanks.

Try to learn this ability first whenever you acquire a new G.F. (it
takes only 10 AP anyway).


[Abilities]
Allows usage of learnt menu abilities such as 'Fire Magic Refinement'
or 'Junk Store'. Tap left or right on the d-pad to scroll.


[Switch]
Once your party exceeds three members, you must select 2 characters
to accompany Squall. This command is only available on the Overworld
and on Save Points in the field screens for the Japanese version.

In the U.S version, an additional command, 'Junction Exchange', enables
you to easily transfer a set of equipped G.Fs, abilities and spell
lists between characters. Convenient for those scenes in which you
have to guide two different parties.

Inactive party members gain zero EXP from battles fought by the main
party.


[Card]
Displays the cards that you've acquired so far. Hit left or right on
the d-pad to scroll through the 10 levels of cards. Refer to the Card
Battle section below for more information concerning this mini-game.


[Configuration]
A set of customization controls are available here.

(note: The last two options are for those playing with a Sony Dual
       Shock Analog Controller)

Sound: Change between Stereo or Mono.
Controller: Change the controller settings to Normal (Default) or
            Customize. Push the 'X' or 'Circle' button at the Customize
            option to bring up the controller configuration screen.
Cursor: The Memorize option here lets you store the last position of
        the finger cursor even after the window is closed.
ATB: Set the flow of time in battles.
     <Active> -- For skilled players. Time flows even when commands,
                 spells and items are being selected.
     <Wait> -- For beginners. Time stops when spells and items are
               being selected.
Scan: The detailed analysis of an enemy will only appear the 1st time
      you cast 'Scan' (Japanese version: Libra) on an enemy under the
      default Initial settings.
Camera Movement: The higher the percentage, the more frequently the
                 camera angle changes in battle.
Battle Speed: Adjust the speed of time flow during battles.
Battle Message: Adjust the message speed in battles.
Field Message: Adjust the message speed in the field screens.
Analog Input: Change the sensitivity of the analog sticks.
Vibration Function: Turn rumble feature ON/OFF.


[Tutorial]
Lets you learn more about ff 8's systems and world. The SeeD Tests
are also accessed via this command. If my guide hasn't been too precise
in explaining the various systems Final Fantasy VIII has to offer, this
is where you should refer to. In fact, I highly encourage you look
through the Tutorial at least once.


[Save]
Final Fantasy VIII takes up one block of space on a Memory Card. The
Save command can only be used to record a position on the Overworld
and on Save Points in field screens.


[Order]
Push left on the d-pad in the main menu screen, and a cursor will
appear, allowing you to re-shuffle your main party's lineup in battle.
There's no real reason for you to do this though. Btw, there're no
more 'front' or 'back' rows in ff 8.

And that's all for the Menu Tutorial.

[Battle Basics]
At anytime on the Overworld (with the exception of paved roads and
railway tracks) or in a dungeon field screen, you run the risk of 
encountering enemies.

It's essential you master the Battle System in ff 8; I'll start by 
giving a diagram of the battle layout, and explaining some of the more 
basic features. Here's what you usually see at the bottom of a battle 
screen:

   -COMMAND-------------------------
   |Attack/Mug --> Limit Break     |       NAMES       HP      ACTIVE
   |Magic (or any other command)   |        OF       VALUES     TIME
   |Draw  (or any other command)   |       PARTY                BARS
   |Item  (or any other command)   |      MEMBERS
   ---------------------------------

The Active Time Battle System in ff 8 is based on the recognition that
time does not stop for a party member to enter his or her commands;
the enemy is likely to attack without conveniently waiting for you to
make your decision. The Active Time Bars you see in the lower-right
of the battle screen indicate the period of time left before a member 
has a chance to act. A yellow pyramid mark over a character's head
signals that it is his or her turn to act.

During battles, numbers will pop out of your characters and enemies. 
White numbers indicate damage, while green numbers indicate recovered 
HP (Health or Hit Points).

The HP values represent a particular character's health; once this
number reaches zero, that party member is considered to be 'disabled'
(or KO'ed) and can no longer take part in battle. This condition can
be remedied by a variety of spells and items.

<!> Tip:
In ff 8, the enemies increase their levels in tandem with yours. This
applies to both normal opponents and bosses. Thus, when I list down
a boss's statistics later on in the Walkthrough section, it's only a
rough estimate of what to expect.

<Attack>
The first command lets you attack (duh) and when a party member takes a 
set amount of damage (having roughly 75% of their HPs depleted), they 
will have an alternate way of attacking. This is indicated by a tiny 
arrow by the side of the 'Attack' command. To access it, hit and hold
right on the d-pad, and following that, their respective Limit Break
will appear. Also, by switching to another character, the Limit Break
icon is lost. However, if that character still retains his/her
critical status, the icon can be recovered by tapping 'Circle' (U.S)
or 'Triangle' (Japanese) repeatedly.

Among the characters that join your party, Seifer's the only one who
is capable of activating his limit break without reaching critical
status. Generally, you have a chance of using his Fire Cross when
his HP is depleted by 30 to 40 percent.

<Limit Breaks / Specials>
New or improved Limit Breaks are learnt via magazines. These can be 
found in pet stores or on book shelves. Not all characters require such 
a method though; Squall's finishing blow to his Renzokuken is determined 
by the type of Gunblade he's carrying.

The magnitude (and sometimes length) of Limit Breaks are also 
dependent on factors such as the character's current HP (i.e. Zell
would have more time to input his button motions if his condition is
critical, and lesser time if you simply cast an 'Aura' spell on a
healthy Zell for him to use his 'Duel') and Luck parameter (i.e.
Squall seems to perform a finishing blow more regularly with a higher 
Luck rating and when he's at critical status).

<R1 Trigger>
The R1 button is used to activate double damage for Squall's Gunblade. 
The best time to do this is when Squall dashes across to the enemy,
lifts his sword, and you hear the swish of his blade. Press R1 
immediately and Squall should connect for 2x damage.

<Magic>
Magic is a simple click-and-use procedure, and the amount of a
particular magic you can cast is limited by the number appearing beside 
it. Press left or right on the d-pad to scroll if the character has 
additional spells. MP (Magic Points) values are non-existent in ff 8.

<Draw>
The 'Draw' command is available to all junctioned characters. Clicking
on it, then an enemy will produce a sub-window showing the enemy's
magic list. Select the magic you want, and another sub-window appears.
The 1st is 'Stock', whereby the member absorbs that particular spell
from the enemy for later use. The absorbed spell, if any, will then be
usable in the character's magic list. The 2nd option is 'Cast', which
allows you to use the chosen spell on anyone.

The magnitude of the spell, plus the amount you get when you try to
stock a spell is determined by your character's 'Magic' parameter as
well as 'Luck'. Both options may sometimes result in failure; you can
try as many times as you wish, though. 

<G.F.>
'Guardian Force' is an ability that summons G.Fs under your command.
Surprisingly enough, there is no limit to its usage; just note that 
whenever this command is used, the caster's HP will be converted to 
that of the summon monster, and any attacks on him or her during this 
period will be absorbed by the G.F. When this value falls to zero, the
character loses the ability to summon the G.F. for that particular 
fight.

And as any summoner would tell you, G.Fs don't appear immediately when
they're called; the time it takes for them to come is shown by a blue
bar, which replaces the summoner's active time bar. G.Fs regain lost
HP via walking around or using G.F. items. Such items can be purchased
from shops. You'll also need items to revive fallen G.Fs, or simply
rest at a Hotel.

<Items>
Items are pretty basic. Select an item and decide whom to use it on.

<Mug / Capture> (note: Important!)
In addition to the above battle commands, others are made available as
you train up more Guardian Forces. I'll like to highlight 'Mug'
here, which allows you to attack, then steal from the enemy. Enemies
carry and drop (there IS a difference between these 2 terms) different
items at different levels. So, say if I steal from a Wendigo, I might
receive a Steel Pipe, but if I defeat it (without stealing from it
previously!), it might drop a Steel Orb instead. Also note that
once you've successfully stolen something from an enemy, don't expect
it to drop anymore items when you do defeat it, except for cards.

Another thing: what an enemy might drop can also be determined by G.F.
Bahamut's 'Rare Item' party ability. So if an enemy isn't dropping
what you're looking for, try equipping that ability if you have it.
Likewise, if you've 'Rare Item' equipped but the enemy doesn't give
up the item you want, try de-equipping that ability instead.

If you still have trouble acquiring the items you want, I suggest
using G.F. Quezacotl's 'Card' command ability on the enemy,
followed by 'Card Mod.' menu ability to get the items. However, this
tactic might not work on all enemies.

<Running Away>
Escaping is done by holding down R2 and L2. You cannot run away from
boss encounters. The easiest method to escape is to start pressing
down the buttons as soon as the battle begins, since you can often
take advantage of the enemies' unpreparedness.

Just note that you will be penalised for running away; refer to the
SeeD Ranking section below for more details.

<Battle Formations>
In a normal encounter, your party members start off with their Active
Time Bars partially filled. However, there exists 2 special battle
situations in ff 8:

First Strike -- Either the party or your enemies begin the fight with
                full time bars.
Back Attack -- Similar to 1st Strike attacks in the sense that either
               the party or your enemies begin the fight with full
               time bars. In addition, the side caught by surprise
               will start with their backs turned.
               Both your party members and enemies take twice as much
               damage if attacked while their backs are turned.

Your party's combined 'Luck' parameter seems to determine the 
frequency of such special battle situations.

<Ending a Battle>
The battle ends when all of the members on either side are killed or
petrified, or if the enemy or your party runs away.

You receive EXP (Experience Points), AP (Ability Points) and Items 
from defeated opponents. For methods to obtain Gil, the form of 
currency in ff 8, refer to the SeeD Ranking section below.

Incidentally, you need only 1,000 EXP to go up a level in ff 8. Unlike
ff 7, characters not in your fighting party gain zero EXP... I'll 
advise you practise rotating your squad members to make sure nobody's 
too far ahead (or behind) in terms of levels.


[Battle Tips]
A majority of the enemies in ff 8 are weak against status ailments 
attacks such as Sleep, Stop or even Death. This becomes all the more 
apparent when you get to junction spells to Status Attack, so try 
experimenting on enemies with different maladies -- some of them can 
even work on bosses!

A lot of people don't seem to realise they can switch between
characters (provided their active time bars are full) using 'Circle'
for the U.S version, and 'Triangle' for the Japanese version. This
comes in handy when you want to use a specific party member either to
heal or to attack.

Using the target window in battle (hit L1) lets you accurately select
which enemy to attack; it's also a great way to check the name of a
particular monster.

A hit in the back results in double damage; this applies to both your 
party members and enemies for physical attacks.

In ff 8, you actually gain EXP when you flee from battle, depending on 
the amount of damage you did to your opponents. Any character that 
finishes off an enemy gets more EXP as well, so be sure to let Squall 
give up his easier kills to a weaker member. This situation also
applies to G.Fs.

Incidentally, if you think Squall is too far ahead in his levels, I
suggest petrifying him for a few battles, since characters affected by
petrifaction receive zero EXP and AP ^_^ Make sure to switch Squall's
junctioned G.Fs (if any) over beforehand! They won't receive any EXP
nor AP if Squall's petrified.

Towards the end of the game, you'll come to rely heavily on Squall's 
Renzokuken to dish out the heavy damage. I've included a way to 
exploit this to your maximum advantage:

1. Junction Ultima x 100 to Strength, and learn Strength +60% character
   ability. This should raise Squall's offense to 255. Learn Auto Haste
   party ability from G.F. Cerberus.

2. Obtain Aura magic (drawable from Heaven/Hell Islands and Seifer at
   the end), or Aura Stones via G.F Siren's Tools Refinement menu
   ability (each Power Wrist gives you 10 Aura Stones; they can be
   bought from the Pet Store in Esthar).
   Also draw Meltdown (U.S) or Merton (Japanese) magic from high 
   level Gaylas (white flying creatures with black stripes on the
   Trabia continent) and Bombs (in a forest near to Kashkabald Desert,
   or in the Fire Caverns). You might want to have a few Haste spells
   on hand too.

3. During confrontation, cast Haste on Squall (optional, especially if
   he has Auto Haste on already). Follow this up with Meltdown (Merton)
   on the enemy; this reduces its defense rating to zero. Finally, use
   Aura (Stones) on Squall.

4. Repeatedly tap Circle (U.S) or Triangle (Japanese) for Squall's 
   Limit Break to appear. Each cut, coupled with the R1 Trigger, should
   do over 9,000 damage. If Squall finishes with 'Lion Heart' (equip
   his 'Lion Heart' gunblade first), you should be able to do damage
   amounting to something like 234,000 in one Renzokuken.


[List of Elements]
Final Fantasy's VIII battle system does somewhat rely on other external
factors (apart from the Strength and Magic ratings of a character,
anyway) to calculate damage. Some enemies carry weaknesses against a
certain type of element; others may be protected from them instead.
Here's a list detailing the 11 types of elements found in ff 8:

NON-ELEMENTAL
Non-elemental attacks ignore the magical defense values (and sometimes
defense values) of an opponent; they'll be your most common form of 
offense in ff 8.
Sources: All non-Elemental Attack junctioned weapon strikes, Flare,
         Meteor, Meltdown (Merton), Ultima spells, G.F Siren, G.F. 
         Tonberry, G.F. Cactuar, G.F. Bahamut, G.F. Eden, Gatling
         Gun E. Skill, Ray-Bomb E. Skill, Shockwave Pulsar E. Skill,
         etc.

GRAVITY
Suprisingly, Gravity-typed attacks work well against a notable
percentage of opponents. Just take note that it's still useless on
mechanical monsters.
Sources: Demi (Gravite) spell, G.F. Diablos, Micro Missile E. Skill,
         etc.

HEAL
Most players will use heal-typed spells simply to recover their party's
HPs... unless they know undeads are weak against the healing elements
as well.
Sources: Cure spells, heal-typed items, Recover command ability, etc.

FIRE
Fire works best against ice, undeads, aquatic creatures, beasts and
vegetation.
Sources: Fire spells, G.F. Ifrit, G.F Phoenix, Fire Breath E. Skill,
         etc.

ICE
Use against fire-based creatures (i.e. Bombs).
Sources: Blizzard spells, G.F. Shiva, etc.

THUNDER
Mechanical and aquatic beasts are susceptible to lightning.
Sources: Thunder spells, G.F. Quezacotl, Electrocute E. Skill, etc.

EARTH
Earth-typed attacks are limited in their effectiveness. Never use them
on flying creatures.
Sources: Quake spell, G.F. Brothers, etc.

POISON
Human opponents are weak against Poison; useless against mechanical
beasts.
Sources: Bio spell, G.F. Doomtrain (Ghoulish), etc.

WIND
Flying creatures are at the mercy of wind-typed attacks.
Sources: Aero spell, Tornado spell, G.F. Pandemona (Pandemonium), etc.

WATER
Only a handful of fire-based enemies have a weakness to Water.
Sources: Water spell, G.F. Leviathan, Aqua Breath E. Skill, etc.

HOLY
Try using Holy-typed attacks on undeads.
Sources: Holy spell, G.F. Alexander, etc.

Enemies assaulted by an element they're weak against take twice as much
damage. On the other hand, if the enemy is resistant to an element, it
means that the damage they take from that element can either be halved,
void or even absorbed instead as HP.


[List of Status Conditions]
Status changes can occur both in and out of battle, and can affect both 
your party members and enemies. A few disappear after battle or after a 
set period of time, but most carry over their effects to the next fight 
unless you remedy them. The various conditions include:

DOOM
Effect     Character dies after red timer above his or her head 
           expires

[Triple Triad System]
When walking around town, you can engage other NPCs (Non-Playable 
Characters) in card battles via the 'Square' button. Cards are obtained 
through victories, special events or enemies, and some are very 
difficult to find. Either way, here's the entire playing procedure:

1. Win a card, or turn an enemy into one via Quezacotl's 'Card' 
   command ability. Look for a card player, and talk to him or her 
   using 'Square'.

2. Select 5 cards from your deck (not applicable for Random rule).

3. The computer will randomly decide who gets to start first.

4. The game is played on a 3 by 3 tiled board, with the blue cards 
   belonging to you; the pink ones, your opponent.

           ----------------
           |    |    |    |
           |    |    |    |
           ----------------
   PINK    |    |    |    |    BLUE
   DECK    |    |    |    |    DECK
           ----------------
           |    |    |    |
           |    |    |    |
           ----------------

5. You'll notice 4 sets of numbers on each card, the center row having 
   2 numbers side by side. The maximum value for each side is A 
   (equals 10).

6. When 2 opposing cards are placed adjacent to each other, 'Card 
   Battle' commences.

7. The computer will compare these 4 sets of values, and victory is 
   allotted to the card with the higher value. Here's an example, 
   assuming the pink card is the attacking card.

   ---------       ---------  
   |   8   |       |   2   |
   |9     2|       |3     1|  
   |   7   |       |   4   |
   ---------       ---------
    (Blue)          (Pink)

   The values represent the attack power of the card on each of the 4 
   sides. In the above diagram, the blue card (which has been placed on 
   the left of the pink one) seems to have the upper hand, but the 
   value on its right (2) is lower than the value on the left of the 
   pink card (3). Thus, the winner here is the pink card (3>2), and 
   the losing blue card is flipped to show a pink one.

8. Press 'Triangle' to view the Rules if you've forgotten what they 
   were.

9. When all 9 tiles are filled, the player with the majority of the 
   cards in their respective colour wins. 


[Rules Details]
Rules vary from region to region, although you can abolish some of the 
more troublesome ones via winning a game in that territory or paying 
the Card Queen at Balamb City's train station 30,000 Gil. Special 
rules include:

(Important: In all cases assume the blue card is the attacking card!)

SAME: When a card is placed adjacent to 2 or more cards, and the values 
      on the sides of that particular card facing the rest are equal, 
      the attacking card wins.  

   ---------       ---------  
   |   5   |       |   8   |
   |1     3|       |3     4|  
   |   7   |       |   9   |
   ---------       ---------
    (Blue)          (Pink)

   ---------    
   |   7   | 
   |6     A|   
   |   A   | 
   ---------  
    (Pink)   

      Look at the right and bottom values of the blue card, which are 
      identical to the values of the pink cards directly facing them 
      (3 & 3, 7 & 7). In this case both the pink cards are flipped. 

PLUS: When a card is placed adjacent to 2 or more cards, and the values 
      on 2 or more of the sides in contact add up to the same figure, 
      the attacking card wins.

   ---------       ---------  
   |   5   |       |   2   |
   |1     4|       |5     A|  
   |   1   |       |   4   |
   ---------       ---------
    (Blue)          (Pink)

   ---------    
   |   8   | 
   |9     3|   
   |   7   | 
   ---------  
    (Pink)

      Take note of the right and bottom values of the blue one. When 
      you add the values of the pink cards directly facing them, the 
      numbers calculated are the same, i.e. 4+5=9 and 1+8=9. In this 
      case both the pink cards are flipped.
   
SAME WALL: The vertical and horizontal sides of the playing field are
           taken as having a value of 'A'. Same Wall is extremely
           rare, and occurs in conjunction with the Same and Plus rule.

           Look at the left, upper and bottom values of the blue card.
           Under the 'Same Wall and 'Same' rule, the value of the
           playing field directly facing the blue card, bottom value
           of the pink card above the blue card and upper value of
           the pink card below the blue card are identical (A & A,
           1 & 1, 5 & 5 respectively). Both pink cards are thus
           flipped.

COMBO: When a card changes colour under the Same, Plus or Same Wall 
       rules, its values now affect the cards with the opposing 
       colour. Thus, one can actually set a card, flip the opponent's, 
       and the flipped card will also act against those around it, 
       flipping them as well within a single turn. You can set up 
       multiple chains in this way.

    (Pink)

       Under the Same rule, the blue card in the upper-left should flip 
       both the pink cards to the right and bottom of it. 
       Now look at the bottom value of the card to the right of the 
       blue card. Having been flipped, the now blue card should act upon 
       the pink card directly beneath it, flipping it in the process 
       (4>2).
       The same also applies to the (now blue) card to the bottom of 
       the initial attacking blue card, thus the pink card in the 
       lower-left is flipped (A>8). Chains are set up in this way, and 
       can often turn near-defeats into victories in Card Battles.

ELEMENTAL: Some cards such as Ifrit's have an elemental to them (in 
           this case Fire). When placed on a tile with the 'Fire' 
           element symbol on it, the values of the card increase by 1 
           on all 4 sides. 
           Other than that, if the element symbol on the tile does not
           correspond to the card's elemental, the values of the card 
           on all 4 sides will decrease by 1 instead.
           However, the Same, Plus and Same Wall rules ignore the 
           added or decreased (if any) values of a card; keep that in 
           mind the next time you want to activate such rules.

Open: All cards can be seen.
Random: All cards are randomly picked.
Sudden Death: The game goes on in the event of a Draw. Players retain 
              only the cards in their respective colour from the end 
              of the previous Card Battle.
Trade Rules: These range from being able to pick and keep zero to all
             cards from the loser.

Cards are useful via Quezacotl's 'Card Mod.' menu ability; many of them
grant the items required to upgrade your weapons, characters or G.Fs.
There's a total of 110 different cards to collect, btw.

If you've completed your collection of cards, a star will appear next
to the Card command in the menu screen. And even if you destroy one of
your cards using 'Card Mod.', the star will still remain there.


[Card Tips]
Try to prevent some of the more cumbersome rules from spreading, i.e
'Random' or 'Sudden Death'. Rules that you want to spread are 'Open'
(Balamb region has it), or even 'Same' if you're an experienced player.
To prevent rules from spreading, just keep saying 'No' when an NPC
suggests combining rules. He or she will eventually play you with the
particular region's rules alone.

Initially, you won't have much good cards to begin with, so Card Battle
on Disc One should be kept to a minimum. However, by the end of Disc
One, you should have amassed 4 rare cards: Ifrit, Sacred, Minotaur and
Diablos. Disc Two should be when you start trashing people in Card
Battle with the above cards. As always, try to win the rare cards in
regions with friendlier rules first, then go for the difficult to obtain
cards such as Edea, which is played under the Random rule.

You can usually tell a good card player apart from the rest when he or
she takes their time deciding which card to play. Inexperienced players
(i.e. most townspeople) simply rashly place their cards without much
thought. You can over-power such players using a good deck of cards,
but defeating a seasoned card player requires some strategy.

When playing with the 'Same', 'Plus' or 'Same Wall' rules, always
check to see if your opponent has the chance to use such rules on you.
You can usually tell when an experienced player places a card in a
seemingly strange position, when he/she could have used that card
to flip over one of yours. However, playing these rules to your
advantage requires a lot on planning ahead, or just plain luck. There's
really no easy way about it; your best bet is experience.

In ff 8, your party receives payment from SeeD on a timely basis. This 
sum is determined by your SeeD ranking, which is assigned to you right 
after the events at Dollet in Disc One. Also, the SeeD Tests become 
available in the Tutorial on the menu screen. The actual number of 
papers Squall can sit for depends on his level, i.e. a lv. 15 Squall 
has access to only 15 out of the 30 tests. Below are the answers:
(Yes=Y / No=N)

Test 1 : Y N Y Y Y N N Y N N        Rank 1 :    500 Gil 
Test 2 : Y N Y Y Y N Y Y N N        Rank 2 :  1,000 Gil

Test 6 : Y N Y Y N N Y Y N Y        Rank 6 :  4,000 Gil
Test 7 : Y Y Y Y Y Y N Y Y N        Rank 7 :  5,000 Gil
Test 8 : N Y N N Y Y N N Y N        Rank 8 :  6,000 Gil

Test 21: Y Y Y Y N N Y Y Y N        Rank 21: 15,500 Gil
Test 22: N N N Y N N N Y Y N        Rank 22: 16,000 Gil

                                    Rank A : 30,000 Gil

If Squall scores a perfect 100 marks in a test paper, his SeeD ranking
is raised by one. The highest rank Squall can attain is A (otherwise
known as rank 31), which pays 30,000 Gil. Each payment occurs after
Squall takes about 24,300 steps or so.

Increasing your rank can also involve other methods, such as success 
at certain game events, or living dangerously in battle. By that I mean 
combating enemies with your characters at critical status (you could 
always blow your opponents away with Limit Breaks). 

To make your rank stay constant, just fight battles normally, using 
physical, magical or G.F. attacks. Decreasing your rank is done by 
escaping from battles too often and not engaging enemies in combat 
frequently enough. Meaning, you shouldn't rely on vehicles or 
chocobos too often to get around.

[Gameplay Tips]
Before you delve into the walkthrough below, why not stop to pick up a
few tips on ff 8? I'm sure the hints below will prove helpful,
especially if this is your first time through the game.

{Leveling Up}
Seeing how the leveling up system has been all but replaced by the
Junction System (which is why you need only 1,000 EXP to gain a level
in ff 8), there's really no need for you to specifically go level up
your characters. Just fight whatever battles that may come your way,
making sure you stop to draw a few spells for junctioning later. This
brings me to my next point, which is...

{Stocking Spells}
You don't really need to have every single spell in your magic list.
Try sticking to the more common (and useful) spells such as Cure, and
ignore the lame ones such as Drain. Each character can only carry 32
out of the 50 spells ff 8 has to offer. Also, whenever possible, I
suggest making use of menu abilities to refine items to spells instead;
it's much more convenient that way.

Another question would be: should all members in your party carry a
full set of spells? Well, you can pretty much get through the game with
just 3 full lists of spells, but I prefer to keep 4 sets. It's really
up to you to decide. I advise against 6, though. It's way too tedious
to maintain and upgrade them.

{Enemies}
Enemies in ff 8 gain levels in tandem with your party. In the process,
they also receive new magic lists (for drawing from), hold and drop
different items. In addition, they may sometimes gain new attacks.

{An Easier Time}
FF VIII can only get difficult if you do not attempt to master the
Junction System. If you can't seem to defeat a particular boss, or
rely too heavily on G.Fs (especially at the game's later stages),
then it's time to learn a few Junction abilities, and draw powerful
spells. The Junction System helps a LOT more towards building a
powerful party member compared to plain old leveling up.

{Spending your Gil}
Since both the armour and accessories systems have been removed, the
only stuff you'll spend money on are items and weapon remodeling. Do
feel free to blow your cash on items. Still, I'll like to caution that
in the early stages of the game, the party gets around on a train a
lot, so make sure you always have enough money left to afford a 3,000
Gil ticket.


[How to use this guide]
You will be presented with choices at certain points in the game; I've
taken the liberty of indicating the best option with an asterisk (*).
Also, the 'Side Events' portions that occasionally pop up really are
optional, meaning you don't have to do them to advance the storyline;
they're usually an opportunity for you to obtain a special artefact or
two, plus to give guidelines on weapon upgrading. Happy travels!

Final Fantasy VIII opens with a nice FMV of Squall and Seifer squaring 
off against each other in a training match. However, Squall is scarred 
in this battle, having taken a direct hit in his face.

Squall awakens from his coma in the infirmary, where the medic there, 
Dr. Kadowaki, asks Squall if he feels all right:
- (Ok, I guess.) *
- (My forehead hurts.)
Give Squall a name; I'll stick with the default name throughout this
walkthrough for convenience's sake.

Dr. Kadowaki then leaves to inform Quistis of Squall's recovery. After 
a FMV showing her arrival, both student and mentor will walk to the 
classroom, with the latter commenting that the entrance examination 
for SeeD is today. 

After class is over, Quistis reminds Squall that he has yet to visit 
the Fire Cavern. Before going off, you might want to check out the 
Study Panel at Squall's seat. There you'll find the following options: 

1. Tutorial (New!)
2. The Basics
3. About Garden
4. A message from Garden
5. Garden Square
6. The School Festival Committee (not available yet)

You'd best be advised to read through all of them. In addition, Squall 
will receive 2 G.Fs, Shiva and Quezacotl, upon selecting the Tutorial.

G.F. Quezacotl offers 2 unique abilities: the 'Card' command  ability
and 'Card Mod.' menu ability. Make sure you learn them. A few notes
about the 'Card' command: it has a much higher chance of working on a
weakened enemy, and sometimes carding a normal enemy earns you a more
powerful boss card instead.

Quezacotl also has 'Mid. Magic Refinement' menu ability, which enables
you to gain access to the middle range spells such as Cura and Blizzara
(i.e. refine 5 Cure spells to obtain a single Cura) relatively early on
in the game.

If you can afford to live with a weak G.F Quezacotl for a while, I
suggest you learn 'Boost' 1st, followed by 'Card', and then 'Card Mod.'
These abilities will come in VERY handy in the game if you're looking
to collect everything of value.

Shiva has the unique 'Doom' command ability, which takes 60 AP to learn.
Seeing how 'Death' works on so many common enemies in ff 8, it might
just come in handy sometimes.

Once done, leave the classroom. Along the way, Squall'll bump into 
Selphie, the newly transferred student from Trabia Garden:
- Are you okay? *
- ......
Squall confirms that she just missed her class, upon which Selphie asks 
Squall for a little tour around Balamb Garden:
- Sure. *
- Don't have the time.

Head on over to the elevator, but before you do that, talk to the guy 
hanging around the lift; he'll grant Squall his first set of cards, 
and tell him to use 'Square' to initiate 'Card Battle'. Bring Selphie 
to the Garden Directory, which is the huge board right to the south 
of the 1st floor. Here's a rough lay-out of Balamb Garden's 1st floor:

                     Students' Dormitory
         Cafeteria            |            Parking Lots

                /---------------------------\

             \--|                           |--/
                |          Elevators        |

                              |
                              |
                         Front Gates

Feel free to explore the place: you can rest and save at the Dorms, 
meet Seifer and company (Raijin, Fujin) at the Cafeteria, and watch 
Zell miss the hot dogs ^_^ Also, try chatting with the Cafeteria Lady
for a bit of info about her son.

Dr. Kadowaki will play cards with you, and the Library offers an 'Esuna'
draw point, plus the 1st volume of Occult Fans. Search the 2nd bookshelf
from left in the background (don't change the camera view); sometimes a
student may be blocking the way, so try re-entering the Library. Avoid
the Training Center for now. 

To the Front Gates once you're done. Quistis joins you here; she starts 
off at lv. 8 with zero spells in her magic list; expect the latter to 
be a constant feature in all new allies.

#######################################################################
1b. [Balamb Region] (note: Junction G.Fs, and NEVER escape from battles
                           for now)

Enemies: Bite Bugs
         Glacial Eye (Fields/Mountains)
         Caterchipillar, T-Rexaur (Forests)
         Fastitcalon-F (Beaches)
#######################################################################

Quistis will bring Squall to the Fire Cavern, which is east of Garden 
behind the forest. Press 'Triangle' to skip through her tutorials if
you so wish (for the U.S version). I recommend you view them, though.

Make sure you have a decent stock of 'Blizzard' spells before you
enter; these can be drawn from the Glacial Eyes (blue flying jellyfish
-like creatures) near the northern cliffs on the Overworld or the
Fastitocalons-F (orange fishes) on the shores of Balamb. Btw, a single
Fastitocalon-F gives you 3 A.P; they're excellent enemies to battle
if you want to build up your G.Fs' abilities at this point in the
game. Fastitocalons appear on most beaches in the Overworld.

<!> Tip:
Actually, whenever you reach a new region, I suggest you check out
the enemies there. They may have some nifty spells for junctioning,
upon which you should spend some time drawing. You'll be surprised
at how much some of the more powerful spells can boost your stats.

#######################################################################
1c. [Fire Cavern] (note: Keep Squall's level within 9 for this dungeon)

Enemies: Bomb, Red Bat, Buel
Draw Points: Fire
G.Fs: Ifrit
Rare Cards: Ifrit
#######################################################################

The Garden Faculty awaiting at the cave entrance questions Squall if
he's prepared:
- Yes...
- Still need to prepare.
I'll leave this up to you.

Squall is asked how long he would take to defeat the boss within and 
come back out (10, 20, 30 or 40 minutes). Take 30 minutes if you're
playing the Japanese version, and 10 minutes for the U.S version.

The Fire Cavern isn't particularly hard, but since random enemy 
encounters count towards the timer, you'd better finish them quickly, 
and keep heading straight into the inner regions of the cave (you can 
always re-visit the place to earn EXP, draw spells and gain Cards 
later, without the darned timer). 

There'll only be 2 times when the route splits; take the 1st one 
right for a 'Fire' Draw Point, and right again the 2nd time. You'll 
meet Ifrit at the end.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS G.F: Ifrit  HP: 1,068  Weak: Ice  Strong vs.: Fire
                 Draw List: Fire(Fira), Cure, Scan
                 AP: 20
 
Being a fire-based creature, you'll naturally want to avoid using any 
fire spells on him. Simply cast Shiva and Blizzard spells repeatedly to
make short work of him. He has a decent attack rating too, so don't
forget to heal your characters when needed.

<For those playing the U.S version>
You wouldn't know now, but you're actually being accessed by the Garden
throughout the first few events in ff 8... the Fire Cavern is one such
place where Squall is tested on his Judgment. To score well for this
scenario, you must finish the battle with Ifrit with as little time as
possible left on the clock.

Whittle down Ifrit's HP to around 100, then stall until the timer hits
15 to 20 seconds. Quickly use a barrage of Blizzard spells to bring the
battle to an end. You'll see how well you scored for this event later
on in the game.  

(note: A ( ) around a spell denotes that it's only available for higher
 level opponents. In this case, you can only draw Fira from a level 20
 or higher Ifrit. Btw, if you're playing the Japanese version, 'Libra'
 has been translated as 'Scan' in the U.S version)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

You'll receive Ifrit as a G.F, and have to make your way back out again.
In the Japanese version, your 30 minutes include both getting in and
out; the U.S version only requires you defeat Ifrit within 10 minutes.

Ifrit offers abilities which boost your HP and Strength. They're very
useful early in the game, and will prove invaluable against strong foes.

Side events: Defeating Bombs sometimes nets you Bomb Fragments or Cards. 
Get either one of these; you'll want one later on for weapon upgrading.
Bombs are extremely vulnerable to Blizzard spells.

Once you're done, return to Balamb Garden. On a side note, you cannot
encounter enemies on the paved roads in ff 8; keep that in mind.

Area Info: Unchanged
#######################################################################

Squall is invited to try for a place in SeeD upon his return. You can 
wander around Garden if you wish, and whenever you feel you're ready, 
head back to Squall's room to change into his school uniform. Make your 
way back to the Lobby with the Garden directory board. There, Squall'll 
be assigned to his party, comprising of Seifer and Zell. Follow them
and head for the Parking Lots.

Area Info: Unavailable (rather, not recommended you explore...)

Go for a spin or 2 in the car before moving on to Balamb City in the 
south-west (and hear Seifer's unflattering remarks about Zell). There 
isn't much you can do right now, so go on and board the ship. Don't
try to go anywhere else; your instructors won't like it!

Xu briefs the group on their mission objective, saying they are to 
liberate the city of Dollet that's under siege by Galbadia. Squad B 
(that's you) is to secure the area right up to the central square.
Seifer then orders Squall to check the situation outside:
- ... Okay. *

1f. [Dollet] (note: Don't converse with Squad A or C members except
                    for Selphie, follow orders, and finish off all
                    enemies quickly. You're being assessed by your
                    instructors in this field exam, so conduct
                    yourselves properly!)

Enemies: Galbadian Soldier
         Anacondaur, Geezard, Elite Soldier (Mountain Range)
Draw Points: Blind
G.Fs: Siren (Elvoret)
Magazines: Weapons Monthly March (Elvoret)
#######################################################################

After the ships crash onto the shore, the loading doors open and Seifer 
leads Squall's party out. Quistis reminds you to equip your G.Fs before 
proceeding; divide your G.Fs among the 3 before following Seifer. Both 
Seifer and Zell join you here; they start off at lv. 9 and 8 
respectively. Junction your party, transferring magic from Quistis
if you have to.

Ignore conversing with any of your colleagues, and follow Seifer.

Seifer then points out 2 oncoming guards and the party encounters 
their 1st battle. Have the members attack normally (you may wish to 
stock up on 'Cure' spells at this point) and make full use of the 
Gunblade's 'R1 Trigger' feature. Note that Seifer's Hyperion also has
this feature, only that his timing is a bit faster.

As the party goes deeper into the town, another pair of Galbadian
troops jump down to ambush the party.

At the central square, Seifer orders the party to eliminate any
remaining guards; proceed to the upper-right alley and do so. Following
that, the characters wait it out as the rest of their troops hold off
the remaining Galbadians.

Finally, Seifer loses his patience (no thanks to the dog) and decides 
to check things out ahead. Zell questions this act as he thinks it's 
out of the mission parameter, but is dismissed by Seifer and Squall. 
The latter especially, seems quite eager to prove himself. Follow
Seifer.

After the party crosses the bridge, they chance upon the injured Dollet 
troops. Seifer spots another injured soldier, who is promptly dragged 
away by a serpent monster before Squall can reach him. A battle occurs.

Seifer remarks that things are starting to get fun now... btw, the
Anacondaur (Hedge Viper) is weak against Ice, so cast Shiva on it.

Follow the path to the comms tower, defeating enemies along the way.
Seifer will run off on his own (probably too eager already) and Selphie
arrives to convey a message, conveniently replacing Seifer in the
process.

Jump off the cliff:
- That's the plan.
- No way... * 
Take the longer path to your right to meet up with Selphie, who 
complains about Squall not taking the shortcut. Zell remarks that 
nobody would normally leap off cliffs:
- Yeah, I guess so.
- I don't know about that...
I'll leave this up to you to choose.

Selphie joins you here; she starts off at lv. 8. Proceed to the 
communication tower once you've junctioned her properly.

Side event: Geezards (Haurizaados) here (strange greyish creatures with
a pink under-belly) give you Screws. These are useful in upgrading your
weapons.

Once inside, run around a bit to encounter enemy troops, and make use 
of this opportunity to heal your characters as well as to stock up on 
curative items and spells. Take note of the 'Blind' Draw Point to the 
left. Once you're ready, step onto the elevator and take it to the top
(1st option). 

<!> Tip:
Be sure to have saved first, and ensure one of your party members has
the 'Draw' command; you'll need to draw a G.F in an upcoming battle.

The scene switches to Wedge (the blue guy) and Biggs (the guy in red). 
Biggs is trying to repair the satellite when Wedge comments about a
monster in the vicinity. The former pays no attention, much to the
chagrin of Wedge, who decides to look around first.
 
Before long, Squall arrives, and in the commotion, Biggs starts the 
satellite up. He is elated, but not after the party engages him in 
battle. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUB-BOSSES: Biggs  HP: 610  Weak: Poison
                   Draw List: Fire, Thunder, Blizzard,
                              Esuna
            Wedge  HP: 608  Weak: Poison
                   Draw List: Fire, Thunder, Blizzard,
                              Cure
                   Total AP: 8
 
Have the party use G.Fs if you wish, but it'll be better to keep drawing 
magic out of these 2 guys first, especially Esuna. After defeating them, 
Elvoret will make his appearance; save your items and spells for him. 

BOSS: Elvoret  HP: 2,872  Weak: Wind  Strong vs.: Poison
               Draw List: Thunder(Thundara), Cure(Cura), Double, Siren
               AP: 10

Unleash everything (well, maybe not EVERYTHING; save a few Thunder 
spells and items) you've got on this creature. If your G.Fs are at a
decent level, he should go down easily. Just make sure to pop in the 
occasional heal spells, and use any limit breaks when they're made
available. He also has Siren, a G.F. among his list of magics, so be
sure to draw it from him. Watch out for his Storm Breath too, which 
takes off 100 plus damage from everyone. You'll receive the March
issue of Weapons Monthly from him.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Siren, although not your best G.F. in terms of attacking power, has a 
wide array of menu abilities waiting to be learnt. She also has the 
Treatment (Chiryou) command ability, which cures ANY status ailment.
Her 'Move-Find' party ability enables you to see hidden save and
draw points; it's definitely a must-have.

Selphie relays new information to Squad B: they are to assemble at 
the shore at 1900 hours. Seifer notes the 30 minute deadline given 
before he leaves.

When you regain control, quickly board the lift and descend. The 
scene then cuts to Biggs, who activates a last ditch defense mechanism 
before gloating and falling over. Save before you leave the comms.
tower; 30 minutes is more than enough time to make your escape.

Outside, the X-ATM092 makes its untimely appearance, and the party 
has to fend it off. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUB-BOSS: X-ATM092  HP: 5,492  Weak: Thunder  Strong vs.: Poison
                    Draw List: Fire, Blizzard, Cure, Protect
                    AP: 50 (or none)

Hit it with your Thunder spells, then attack normally. If you pull it
off fast enough, the spider should collapse before getting a chance to
use its 'Ray-Bomb'. Escape using R2 and L2. And while using Quezacotl
may seem like a good idea, it eats up the timer, so don't summon it.
You'll just have to do about 1,100 points of damage to make it go down.

<For those aiming for full marks in this operation>
You can defeat it, but only in the 2nd time you face it. The X-ATM092
is invincible the 1st time you encounter it outside the comms. tower.
The best place to take it down is on the bridge.

You'll need to have Squall and Zell at critical status (easier usage of
limit breaks) and Selphie having maximum affiliation with Quezacotl.
Keep hitting the X-ATM092 with specials and Quezacotl (use a Turbo
controller coupled with the 'Boost' G.F. Ability). After it collapses
about 5 to 6 times, it should blow up.

The X-ATM092 gives up random items upon its demise, but they're usually
excellent ones. It's not recommended you take it down though, especially
if this is your first time through the game.

Assuming if you did cause the X-ATM092 to explode on the bridge, then
you can make a clear run to the ship at the beach. You don't have to
save the dog (detailed below), btw.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Retrace your steps through the city, and during this period, you have to
avoid the X-ATM092 another 3 times. The 1st is when you cross the cliff
where you met Selphie; keep the d-pad pressed all the way to the left. 
On the next screen, WALK slowly by coupling 'Triangle' (U.S) or 'X'
(Japanese) with the d-pad or you'll have to do battle again. Don't worry,
the X-ATM092 won't be able to get to you if you do this scene right.

Upon reaching the bridge, run to the 4th lamp post; the X-ATM092 
should leap over you at this point. Stall for a while (about 2 to 3
seconds), then move to the lamp post to your left. This should cause
the Black Widow to jump over you again. Turn back and head right all
the way from here.

At the next screen, dash towards the dog and tap 'X' (U.S) or 'Circle'
(Japanese) repeatedly to make it run away. In the event that you have
to fight again, use the same strategy, and try to keep your HPs above
110 as the Ray-Bomb tends to hit for around 100 plus.

After the last alleyway, the game switches to a CG movie, showing 
Squall's breathtaking escape from the X-ATM092. Strangely enough, if 
you choose, you can enter the cafe Squad C came out from; the X-ATM092 
should miss you completely, and you're free to run at your own pace and 
save on the way. The downside? You'll miss the cool FMV and lower your 
SeeD ranking.

1g. [Exploring Balamb City]

Draw Points: Thunder, Cure
Magazines: Timber Maniacs (Balamb Hotel OR Train Station)
Blue Magic: Ultra Waves
########################################################################

You're free to explore Balamb City now and take in the sights of this 
scenic port town. Gain a few levels, then proceed back to Balamb Garden. 

Side events: Caterchipillars (caterpillars in Balamb's forests) give 
you Spider Webs. It's an essential item in weapon upgrading; Spider
Webs also net you Quistis' Blue Magic, Ultra Waves. Keep one of these
in your inventory after you've used one on Quistis.

You'll also come across you first edition of 'Timber Maniacs' at 
the Balamb Hotel. These detail the adventures of Laguna Loire, a man
you'll certainly be hearing more about in times to come. You can view
all the issues of Timber Maniacs you've collected by accessing the
homepage of the 'School Festival Committee' via Squall's study panel
on the 2nd floor classroom of Balamb Garden. However, this option
won't appear until the later parts of Disc Two.

If you can't seem to find the magazine at the Hotel, then try looking
for it at the train station, right behind the red and white sign-post
there. It seems to alternate locations. 

There's also a copy of Timber Maniacs at Zell's house, but it's a fake.

#######################################################################
1h. [Inauguration Ceremony at Balamb Garden]

Area Info: Unchanged
#######################################################################

Cid will ask how the battle went:
- Felt good. *
- Scared to death.
- ... Whatever.
Head on over to the right, where Seifer is reprimanded for ignoring 
orders. The intercom relays a message, saying that all the 
participants are to gather at the 2nd floor. Talk to everyone there, 
and when Squall tries to leave, the results are announced.

<!> Tip:
I've been getting mail from people saying nothing happens at the 2nd
Floor; just keep in mind this is a timed event, and that the results
will only be announced after a certain amount of time has elapsed. So
if you wanna kill time at the 2nd Floor, trying walking instead of
running, and when you've talked to everyone here, take a leisurely
stroll to the end of the corridor (it's a dead end), then stroll
back... by the time you do this, the Garden Faculty should've 
appeared.

Squall, Zell, Selphie and another person (Nida) are proclaimed 
official members of SeeD. Be sure to talk to Cid again before you 
leave; he'll grant you your 'Battle Report', which shows the number 
of steps taken, fights you fought, and times you escaped). This now
appears in your 'Tutorial' sub-menu, under 'Information'.

SeeD Ranking System:

{U.S version}

Conduct: Reach the shore at Dollet with 25:00 left on the clock to
         score 100.
Judgment: Defeat Ifrit in the Fire Cavern with at least 0:07 left on
          the clock to score 100. 
Attack: Defeat 75 enemies in total. This number does not take into
        account enemies downed by G.Fs.
Spirit: Never escape (except for the FIRST Black Widow fight) from 
        battles to score 100.
Attitude: Don't converse with anyone in Balamb City before the Dollet
          mission, ignore all Squad A and C members while in Dollet,
          leave the defeated Biggs alone, follow all of Seifer's orders,
          do not take the short-cut at the cliff, save the dog from
          the X-ATM092 and refrain from hiding in the cafe.

{Japanese version}

Conduct: Fight the X-ATM092 once, and reach the shore within 5 minutes. 
         Do not enter the cafe Squad C came out of.
Judgment: Complete the Fire Cavern using 30 minutes with Squall at
          level 7 to 9 to score 100.
Attack: Emerge victorious in combat 60 times.
Spirit: Never escape (except for the FIRST Black Widow fight) from 
        battles.
Attitude: Don't converse with Squad A or C, follow all orders, no
          short-cut at the cliff, reach the communication tower
          within 18 minutes, and save the dog at the central square
          from the X-ATM092.

<Both versions>

Defeating the X-ATM092 on the bridge nets you a perfect score of lv.
10. In addition, a 'Bonus' segment will be added to the ranking
criteria.

You should get a decent score of rank 8 if you followed my guide. Rank 
10 is attained by defeating the X-ATM092. The SeeD Tests should also 
be made available to you now in the menu screen; Squall has to be at 
least lv. 30 to open up all 30 papers. 

Attaining full marks in a test increases your SeeD ranking by 1. You
can refer to the SeeD Ranking section in the earlier parts of this
document for the test answers. Be sure to sit for Tests occasionally
throughout the entire game.

Squall'll be paid his salary as he proceeds in his quest. The sum you
get is determined by your SeeD Rank.

Change into your slick military garb after the inauguration ceremony, 
and prepare yourself for the inauguration party.

At the dinner and dance party that night, Squall will meet Rinoa for 
the 1st time. But not before Selphie asks Squall to join the School 
Festival Committee:
- Yeah, I guess so. *
- ......
Selphie won't pose this question if you've agreed to join the Committee
when you spoke to her at the Quad during the start of the game; this
would be before the Fire Cavern section.

After the dance scene, Quistis asks of Squall to meet her at the 
training center; Squall wonders what she's up to. Change into your 
normal attire, and save your game. Head for the Training Center.

########################################################################
1i. [Balamb Garden: Training Center]

Enemies: Grat, T-Rexaur
Draw Point: Blizzard
########################################################################

The Training Center is a relatively short dungeon, but contains some 
of the more powerful enemies you've met so far. While the mutated 
plants are easy enough to dispose of, you'd better run when a T-Rexaur
appears. Defeating it nets you 'Dino Bones' (Quake magic is refinable
from it), but such items are useless at this point in the game. Btw,
which route you take at the start doesn't matter.

Anyway, save when you reach a Save Point, then head on towards the 
nearby door. 

Side events: The T-Rexaur is defeatable, but you'll need the 'Blind'
spell you picked up at a Draw Point in Dollet. Cast it on the
dinosaur, followed by Blizzard spells or Shiva. Dino Bones are
required for weapon upgrading much, much later. The plant-like Grats
here offer a plethora of status ailments spells, which are useful
for junctioning spells to status defense or attack.

Once done, save, then retrace your steps to the exit. The two will 
chance upon a mysterious girl being attacked by a flying creature.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS: Granaldo  HP: 1,538  Weak: Wind  Draw List: Sleep, Shell, Blind
                AP: 5
BOSSES: Raldo x3  HP: 223  Draw List: Fire, Thunder, Protect
                  Total AP: 3
 
This critter is accompanied by 3 flunkies, so just use a G.F. to take 
them out first right at the start of the fight. After that, draw 
'Shell' magic from Granaldo before offing it at your own leisure. It's 
pathetically weak once you get rid of its flunkies. Try putting the
Granaldo to sleep with its 'Sleep' spell.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

########################################################################
1j. [Balamb Garden -- Timber Mission Briefing]

G.Fs: Diablos (Magical Lamp)
Magazine: Weapons Monthly April (Squall's desk)
Rare Card: Diablos
########################################################################

Go back to the dormitory, where Zell informs Squall that he's been 
given a private room. Rest up, and when Selphie tells Squall to meet 
at the Main Entrance in the morning, pick up the April issue of Weapons 
Monthly from Squall's desk in his room.

Cid and a Garden Faculty will brief you on your 1st SeeD mission, 
saying an organization has sought the assistance of SeeD. Squall and 
co. are to leave immediately for Timber where they should meet up with
the organization. Cid gives Squall a 'Magical Lamp' as well (talk to
him again for this).

You're supposed to head on over to Balamb City, but since you've got 
the Lamp already, I suggest you save 1st, and making sure everyone in
your party has a decent Magic rating, use the 'Magical Lamp' in the
menu screen to collect another G.F.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENEMY G.F: Diablos  HP: Variable  Weak: Wind  Draw List: Cure, Demi
                    AP: 20
 
If you aren't careful, he'll mess up your party pretty bad, so be sure 
to have stock-piled curative items and spells. Once the battle begins,
have everyone draw and stock Demi from Diablos (note that you'll need a
decent Magic parameter for your party members in order to do so). 4 or
5 stocked Demi spells per person should be adequate.

Now draw and cast Demi on Diablos, it should hit him pretty hard
initially. Keep at this until you can do only 1 or 2 digit damage to
Diablos with a Demi spell, then finish him off with your most powerful
G.F or a Limit Break.

Diablos can either attack you with a lunge or a single Demi spell;
heal these with Cure spells. However, if he casts Gravija, don't bother
about using any Cure spells; rather, have either Squall or Zell pop
in a quick limit break, then cast your stocked Demi spells on Diablos.
He'll actually retaliate by healing your party with Curaga. Btw, he's
easier to defeat at lower levels. I managed to down him when Squall
was at level 11.

(note: 'Gravite' has been translated as 'Demi' in the U.S version)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you've received Diablos as a G.F, I suggest learning these 3 
abilities first: Mug, Encounter Half and Encounter None. They will
come in handy as the game progresses. Especially Mug, although that
character ability will take quite a while to learn (200 A.Ps).

And while Diablos seems awfully weak at this point, note that his
attack is Gravity-based. At lower levels, he's only capable of
lopping off about one tenth of an enemy's total (not remaining) HP.

Side Event: Try paying a visit to the Library with Zell for a random
event involving a secret admirer. At first only her girl-friends will
drop hints, but returning here often (whenever possible) lets you view
the full set of sequences. The 1st scene you should view here will be
Zell enquiring about a book. The reward for this side quest isn't
all that great though, so you can pretty much choose to ignore this.

########################################################################
[Balamb City: Train Station]

Magazines: Pet Pals Vol. 1 (Train)
########################################################################

<!> Tip:
If you're in need of cash, run around for a while until Squall receives
his SeeD payment.

After buying a ticket for 3,000 Gil at the train station, board the 
train. Bypass the ticket machine, then follow Zell into the room. 
He'll find Vol. One of 'Pet Pals', and ask Squall if he knows about
Timber's current situation:
- I don't care.
- Not too much. *
Zell informs Squall a little more on Timber, a small country invaded
and captured by Galbadia 18 years ago.

########################################################################
1k. [Laguna Dream Sequence Part One: Eastern Forest & Deling]

Enemies: Funguar, Geezard
Draw Points: Cure, Water
########################################################################

These 3 (Ward, Kiros and Laguna) inherit the status of whoever fainted, 
so bear this in mind. Well, the run through the jungle is fairly 
straight-forward. Use the fallen tree to walk over the small stream 
when you reach it, and then mount the vehicle at the end.

[Galbadia: Deling City]
Just as Laguna parks the vehicle, 2 more appear, conveniently blocking 
your way to the other parts of Deling City. Ignore them for now, and 
run to the lower-right (the upper right street leads to an arch, which 
is of no value right now). 

Transverse the city streets until you reach Galbadia Hotel. Save, then
head off to the right staircase. Converse with the waitress, who'll 
ask you to take a seat:
- (I'm walk around a bit first.)
- (Alright, I'm there!) *
- (Huh? Excuse me?) 
The 2nd option lets you hear a nice little piano piece by Julia, an 
aspiring pianist and singer. Laguna himself gets all nervous when she 
asks of him to meet her in her room upstairs. Return upstairs to the 
reception counter:
- Which is Julia's room? *
- Ahh... nothing.
(note: the darker bracketed speech bubbles you see in Laguna's
       scenarios are the reactions of Squall's party)

#######################################################################
1l. [Timber Tracks: Hijack Operation]

Magazines: Pet Pals Vol. 2 (Resistance Base)
Rare Card: Angelo (Watts)
#######################################################################

Squall, Selphie and Zell wake up at this point, and are surprised to 
find they all shared the same dream. Squall makes a note to report 
this to Principal Cid as they disembark from the train. Speak to the 
man waiting on the steps:
- But the moogles are still here.
- But the chocobos are still here.
- But the Owls are still around. *
The 3rd option is the password. Taking either the 1st or 2nd option
results in a rather amusing scene where Watts almost gets knocked down
by a train ^_^

[Resistance Base]
Once on board the train, Zone and Watts will formally introduce 
themselves as the leaders of the 'Forest Owls', and ask of Squall to 
wake their 'princess' up. Squall complies, but not without a few 
threatening remarks first.

Side event: Watts holds Angelo's card, a rare card. You can win it
from him if you so wish, or wait until later in the game.

Head into the other sections of the train (take note of the Save Point
in one of the cabins), into the nice flowery pink room. Rinoa will
recall meeting Squall at the dance party, and requests him to proceed
to the briefing room. Her dog, Angelo, will also make an appearance
here. You will be asked to name both of them; again, this walkthrough
will use the default name settings.

It seems that President Deling of Galbadia will be passing through 
Timber on a train. The trio hatch a plan to capture him, and just for 
your reference, I've included a little diagram to show the entire 
procedure.

=========================[Dummy Car]-[Resistance Base]================

==[Locomotive]-[1st Escort]-[Prez's Car]-[2nd Escort]=================

Basically, you'll have to leap from the Base onto the 2nd Escort, 
run to detach the 1st Escort from the Prez's Car, thus allowing the
Dummy Car and the Base to slip in between the 1st Escort and the
Prez's Car, then uncouple the 2nd Escort, causing the Base to break
away along with the Prez's Car, leaving the Dummy Car in place of the
latter. Relax, you don't have to memorize the procedure.

Rinoa will let Squall have a practice session at entering passwords;
press L1 to exit when you're through. Did you understand the briefing?
- Yes.
- Explain it again.
I'll leave this up to you.

The bulletin board in the upper-right of the planning room has copies
of Anarchist Monthly pinned onto. These provide information on Vinzer
Deling's ascension to power.

Save, then talk to Watts. He'll ask Squall if he's ready:
- Not yet.
- Yeah. *

<!> Tip:
Some people have written in complaining that instead of asking Squall
if he's ready, Watts asks for a game of Card Battle instead... try
speaking to Watts with the 'X' (U.S) button and NOT the 'Square'
button... these two have different functions in ff 8.

[Hijack Operation: Timber Railway Lines]
Your 1st action is to leap across to the 2nd Escort. Do this by
hitting the 'Jump' button ('X' for the U.S. version, 'Circle' for the
Japanese version) when the 2 carriages are relatively close together.
You'll be working against a 5 minute timer, so make it quick.

Next, Squall will have to work his way across the car. Just stay put
and observe the guards... who discover that none of their sensors are
working. Scoot across to meet up with the rest, before the Galbadian
troopers repair the sensors.

Assuming you let the guards repair the sensors, and happen to be
directly above when the blinds are open, here's how you should react:
Blue guards (sound sensors): Halt.
Red guards (temperature sensors): Don't stop, and keep moving.
Time your movements accordingly.

3rd involves detachment of 1st Escort. Zell and Selphie will watch 
out for the guards, so whenever they call out, just rappel up. Here's 
the sequence:

1. Rappel down with 'down' (duh.)
2. Rinoa will give you a random password.

   For the U.S. version:

                     <Triangle=4>
   <Square=3>                            <Circle=1>
                     <Cross=2>

   L1=Scroll screen to the left

   For the Japanese version:

                     <Triangle=1>
   <Square=3>                            <Circle=2>
                     <Cross=4>

   L1=Scroll screen to the left

   So if it's 1 4 2 3 in the U.S. version, you would enter O, T, X, S
   (in the space of 5 seconds, mind you).
3. Basically, you should attempt to enter 2 passwords, then rappel up. 
   Wait for the 2 guards to pass by and return before going down again.
4. You'll have to enter 3 passwords for this one.

The 4th step is the detachment of the 2nd Escort. You'll need to 
enter 5 passwords now instead of 3; this time you'll have to look out 
for guards yourself with R1. Step 3 above still works though, so the 
guards shouldn't be a problem. Do this right the 1st time and your 
SeeD ranking will be raised. The whole operation should take you less
than 3 minutes.

Well, after all that talk, junction your members (excluding Rinoa) and
save, then do yourselves a favour by returning to Rinoa's room to pick
up the 2nd volume of 'Pet Pals'. Converse with Rinoa again when you're
ready to go:
- Not yet.
- Yeah. *
Rinoa and company will finally meet up with Deling, but he turns out to
be a fake one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS: Fake President  HP: 532  Draw List: Cure

Easy enough. You can stock up on 'Cure' spells if you wish.

BOSS: Gerogero  HP: 2,750  Weak: Holy, Fire, Earth, Heal  
                Strong vs.: Poison
                Draw List: Esuna, Double, Berserk, Zombie
                Total AP: 20

This guy likes to cast various status ailment spells on you, so come 
equipped with various curative items, or simply the ability to draw
Esuna from him. Attack Gerogero with Fire-junctioned Elemental Attacks,
Cure spells and G.F. Ifrit.

This tactic applies only to the Japanese version: one Phoenix Down is
all it takes to kill Utoku. Now that you know that, you might still
want to spend some time drawing Esuna and Double from him though. This
also works in the U.S version, but chances are that it has a higher
percentage of missing Gerogero.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gerogero had a different colouration in the Japanese version; most of
the blue areas on him were actually red.

After the fight, the party'll discuss the next course of action. 
Supposedly, Deling is scheduled to make a speech at Timber TV Station 
soon, so your next plan would then be to snoop around for info into 
getting to the broadcast station. 

Make a party of 3. I suggest you bring a weaker character as the 3rd
party member; there're some opportunities to gain a few EXP here.
Talk to Watts to leave.

While Timber's topography isn't exactly the most confusing ever in
ff 8, I guess I'll do no harm by providing you guys with a map, right?
Here you go:

                                                 Main Gates

*the bracketed locations mean that they're train platforms, and where
 each train is bound. After the events in Timber, the (Resistance
 Train) station becomes (Deling City).
 
There'll be Galbadian guards around, so take time off to draw a few 
spells from them. You might want to purchase Pet Pals Vol. 3 and 4 
from the Pet Store near the station which runs towards Balamb. All 
trains are non-operational at this time. 

There'll be a few instances when you need to combat the Galbadian 
soldiers, and resting is accomplished by heading to 'Owl's Tears', 
which is right at the outskirts of town. It's this little cabin with 3 
persons living inside. Tell the old man that you like beverages
(2nd option), and examine the tap to the left to heal up. However, if
you plunder the 500 Gil from the cupboard beneath the television (just
examine the cupboard repeatedly), you lose this service.

You might also want to check out Timber Maniacs, which Laguna worked as 
a journalist for. There's a copy of an adult magazine (Girl Next Door) 
and Timber Maniacs to be picked up here among the stacks of books in
the lobby and editing room respectively. The dark room in Timber
Maniacs hides a 'Blizzaga' draw point as well.

Btw, there's a guy clad in a grayish-green jacket outside Timber
Maniacs; be sure to encourage him to receive a mediocre item from him
later on in Disc Two.

The house next door has a lady who will speak of an alleyway behind the 
Pub which leads to the TV Station. Once you're done, head on over to 
the Pub, by taking the stairs at the juncture in the next screen. 

2 conversing Galbadian soldiers will mention about having obtained a 
Card; kick their butts to receive a lame monster card. There's an
item shop to the left, so go ahead and purchase any goods before
entering the Pub.

There's a drunk man blocking the exit to the backlane inside:
- Observe.
- Talk to him. *
Squall will have to respond to his demands for a drink:
- Buy him a drink.
- Tell him about the cards. *
- Do nothing.
He'll give you a Tonberry card, and move out of the way when you select
the 2nd option.

You can also choose to buy him a drink, but you won't receive anything
in return. Talk with the woman to the left to know the drunk's
favourite type of drink, then observe the drink the drunk's holding.
Here's a list:

                 [Red]          [Yellow]          [Green]
[Sweet]          Mimett         Curiel            Tantal

[Bitter]         Krakka         Sylkis            Reagan

Outside, save, and follow the path to the TV Station. Rinoa, upon
seeing the tight security around the place, decides to switch to a less
subtle way of getting into the TV Station... much to the displeasure of 
Squall, who's annoyed by the way she changes her mind so quickly. 

Rinoa asks him to voice his opinions:
- Yeah, I'll tell you. *
- Forget it. 
It seems that Squall will still tell Rinoa off no matter which you 
choose though. You'll have the option of continuing or stopping:
- ... Guess I'll follow up.
- Well, just leave it at that. *
Hurt, Rinoa runs off on her own, just as the programme starts.

Vinzer Deling, President of Galbadia, will commence his speech. He 
starts to introduce his ambassador, a sorceress, but before he
announces her name, his broadcast session is disrupted. Head for the
TV Station immediately.

Zell, in the midst of the commotion, unknowingly lets slip Garden has 
dispatched them to deal with the situation in Timber. Follow Quistis.

The party has to get out of Timber after things have gotten ugly. Upon 
leaving the 'Foxes of the Forest' (the house next to Timber Maniacs), 
Watts, disguised as a Galbadian soldier, tells them that a train is 
bound for Dollet at the station, and to take care of Rinoa:
- Ok (I have my orders).
- Ok (You be careful, too).
I'll leave this up to you.

Retrace your steps, meet up with Zone (dressed as an old man), who'll
pass you your tickets. Proceed right from here for the (Dollet)-bound
train.

Board the train?
- Get on. *
- Not yet.
You'll have the option of talking to Zell in the train carriage:
- (Leave him alone.) *
- (Stay put.)
Take the 1st option to advance the storyline.

Actually, while the story requires you to drop off at the East Academy 
Station, I suggest you give that a miss and alight further on at Dollet. 

#######################################################################
1n. [Dollet and Timber Revisited] <optional>

Draw Points: Silence (Dollet)
Magazines: Timber Maniacs (Hotel Dollet, Dollet Pub, Timber Hotel)
           Occult Fans Vol. II (Dollet Pub)
Rare Cards: Siren (Master Card Player, 2F Dollet Pub)
#######################################################################

While pretty much a scenic port town, Dollet has a number of 
interesting events and items. First off, check out the hotel rooms for 
an issue of 'Timber Maniacs'. 

Further down the streets, at the Pub, a man on the 2nd floor (he's the 
one to the left) will play cards with Squall. If you manage to defeat 
him (the 'Random' rule in Dollet makes it kinda hard...), he'll lead you 
to his private room. There's also a copy of Timber Maniacs on the 2nd
floor of the Pub.

Check out the magazines on the floor (make sure you look at them from
every angle, sometimes you'll find different stuff for each of the 4
sides of each stack) for 'Occult Fans Volume II'. And if you're really
eager to complete your card collection, Siren's card is winnable from
the same guy, who's also known as the Master Card Player.

One of the houses has a painting hanging in the center... Squall has to 
look for a mutt around Dollet (each painting has a bone which gives the 
location of the dog outside the house). There's a total of 3 locations; 
you can get a free Potion, Phoenix Down and Soft (Gold Needle) for your 
efforts. If you do this in Disc Three, you'll get a Potion, Mega-Potion
and an Elixir instead.

The Dollet trooper to the left of Hotel Dollet denies Squall access to
the comms. tower; talk to him twice to bust through. I've no idea
what this is for, but you get a pretty amusing sequence at the end of
the path with the bumbling Galbadian troops.

[Timber Re-visited]
Look for a copy of Timber Maniacs at the now-open Timber Hotel.

There'll be a guy standing on the bridge near Timber Hotel; talk to 
him with a female companion (i.e. Rinoa or Quistis) in your party to
receive a free Potion. He appears randomly, and you can do this as
many times as you wish to stock up on Potions.

######################################################################
1o. [Timber Region: Obel Lake and Roshfall Forest] <optional>

Enemies: Funguar, Geezard
         Thrustaevis (Fields)
         Wendigo, Anacondaur, Cockatrice, Ochu (Forests)
Blue Magic: Electrocute 
######################################################################
  
Obel Lake on the world map has a strange shadow in the water who'll 
chat with you about its missing monkey when you hum (2nd option)... 
I'll detail this event later on in the walkthrough.

And as for Roshfall Forest, it's on the opposite bank of where the
water-dweller lives, that huge patch of forest. The bottom left window
in your Menu screen tells you the name of your current location. Both
Obel Lake and Roshfall Forest are to the north of Timber.

Wendigo (a headless freak which resembles a wild gorilla) roams in 
this forest, and gives up 'Steel Orbs' upon its defeat. Get at least 2
of these. When mugged, the Wendigo provides you with 'Steel Pipes',
but it's highly unlikely you've learnt the 'Mug' character ability
from Diablos at this point. Just keep this point in mind for now.
The Steel Orbs will be required later on for weapon remodeling; if
you're having trouble defeating the Wendigo, put it to sleep first
with a 'Sleep' spell, then use your G.Fs.

Also, Cockatrices (birds with yellow chests and a green belly) are 
present in the forests. You can receive Coral Fragments (lets Quistis 
learn another Blue Magic, Electrocute) when they're at levels 1 to 19.

#######################################################################
[East Academy Station and Eastern Forest]

Area Info: None.
#######################################################################

The eastern forest lies between 2 cliffs, west of the East Academy
station. Before you enter, make sure both Quistis and Selphie are
properly junctioned.

Rinoa will come to comment on the way Squall treats his comrades so
coldly.

######################################################################
1p. [Laguna Dream Sequence Part Two: Centra Excavation Site]

Enemies: Esthar Soldiers, Gesper, Elastoid
Draw Points: Sleep, Confuse, Cure
Blue Magic: Degenerator
######################################################################

In typical Laguna fashion, he realises that he had brought the wrong
map for this patrol. Still, he has a bad feeling about this:
- Nah, just my imagination. *
- Yeah, a bad feeling...
The run through the mines can be very straight-forward, depending on
how you tackle it. However, I'll give you the full set of events here.

Proceed forward to battle 2 sets of Esthar soldiers. There'll be a 
fork in the road afterwards; take the right one. 

Follow the path into the mines until it splits again. There's an 
invisible 'Old Key' near the half-buried semi-circle structures, but
Laguna loses it the minute he picks it up ^_^ Anyway, head to the left
of the screen.

You'll eventually come to 3 steel hatches set in the floor. Have 
Laguna examine the switch on the center one (it's on the upper-right 
of the hatch):
- Tamper with it. *
- Leave it alone.
Head back a screen from where you came from, and laugh as the Esthar
soldiers fall for Laguna's (crude) trap. Now return and try to do the
same for the hatch on the right. However, Laguna won't be able to open
it, so just ignore it for now. It'll open by itself after the events
below, but you still must tamper with it first.

Retrace your steps back to where you initially fought the 2 sets of
Esthar soldiers. Take the left route now, and follow it until you
reach a ladder. Descend.

In the next screen, there's yet another 'Old Key' hidden among the 
debris to the left of the screen.

The path will lead to the same 3 steel hatches. Examine the left hatch,
but Laguna decides not to tamper with it after all.

Now return to where you located that 1st 'Old Key', and head upwards.
The route should split here again; take the northern path to find a
bomb detonator on the ground. 

Examine it:
- Press the blue switch.
- Press the red switch. *
- Forget it.
Choose to hit the red switch first, followed by the blue one to 
exterminate 2 batches of Esthar soldiers. Proceed onwards from here, 
but keep a lookout for another boulder to the left, in an area 2 
screens up from where you discovered the bomb detonator. Push it using
'X' (U.S) or 'Circle' (Japanese).

Making your way upwards, you'll find a save point. Save before heading 
north.

Now the trio have to combat a whole slew of miners (5 sets of battles 
if you didn't trigger all of the traps here, or just 1 if you did); the 
last one's 'Soul Crush' will drain Kiros and Ward's HP completely, so 
remember to cure your injured members when you regain control of Squall. 
Laguna makes a valiant attempt to save his friends' lives...

Btw, while the tampering of hatches may seem totally irrelevant at
this point in time, it'll enable you to pick up a few nifty items much,
much later on in the game, when Squall's party returns to this dungeon.
Trust me, the extra trip's worth it.

Side events: Gespers (over-sized blue headed creatures) and Elastoids
(flying brown stools) make their appearances here, but they're extremely 
rare. If you're lucky enough to encounter them, the former will net you 
a Black Hole (lets Quistis learn 'Degenerator') and the latter's card, 
when modified gives you a Steel Pipe. The Elastoid is known as the
Invincible in the Japanese version.

You'll face 2 types of Esthar soldiers here: the human and the cyborg.
The latter are much more dangerous, so you should make it a point to
defeat them first in combat. Cyborg soldiers appear darker compared
to human ones.

2a. [Galbadia Garden Region: Monterosa Plateau] <optional>

Enemies: Belhelmel, Geezard, Blood Soul
Weapons: Rising Sun (Rinoa)
#######################################################################

While in this area, you might want to encounter Belhelmels, spiky 
masked creatures dangling in mid-air. Use Diablos' 'Mug' command 
ability to steal Saw Blades from them, which are one of the items 
required to upgrade Rinoa's weapon to a 'Rising Sun'. Couple one of 
these blades with 8 Screws. Btw, Belhelmels also drop Saw Blades.

2b. [Galbadia Garden] (note: Irvine joins you here; he starts off at
                             lv. 13)

Draw Points: Haste, Double, Shell, Life (Raise)
Weapons: Ulysses (Irvine)
########################################################################

Upon your arrival, Quistis makes a move first to contact the Headmaster 
of this Garden. The PA system soon announces the party's next 
destination: the Reception Room, which is accessed by hitting the 
north-western exit in the Main Lobby, then climbing the stairs. 

Before you do that, I suggest you explore around a bit first, and 
familiarize yourself with the surroundings; you'll be back here later. 
The glowing center of the Main Lobby hides a 'Haste' draw point; as does 
the changing rooms of the skating rink (north-eastern exit from Lobby),
which holds a 'Life' D.P. The Auditorium on the 2nd floor also 
offers a 'Double' D.P. Apart from those, you'll find an assortment of 
nice (but not rare) boss cards from the Galbadian Garden students.

Make your way to the Reception Room afterwards. Talk with everyone
inside, until Squall leaves in a fit.
 
Head on over to the Main Lobby, where the ever lovable duo of Raijin and
Fujin show up; they've come to deliver a message, and to find Seifer.

At the main entrance, Martine, Headmaster of Galbadia Garden, briefs the 
party on their new orders: both Balamb Garden and Galbadia Garden will 
work together on a plan to assassinate the sorceress Edea, as requested
by a certain general of the Galbadian army. Martine's known as Dodonna
in the Japanese version.

Irvine is the assigned sniper for the mission. And of course, he isn't 
gonna miss his opportunity to get close to the females:
- Yeah, whatever. (you can also take this for an amusing scene with 
                   the girls)
- ... That's no good. *
I suggest you take Irvine into your main party, especially if he's way 
too low in levels compared to yours. And if you've got a Steel Pipe, a 
Bomb Fragment (impossible to obtain now... use Quezacotl's menu ability
'Card Mod.' to refine a lv. 4 Bomb card) and 2 Screws, you can upgrade
Irvine's shotgun.

Either way, head on over to the Far East Train Station in the south
-west, making sure you've got at least 3,000 gil to spare, and board
the Deling City-bound train.

Wait for a bus at the very first station you see, board it, then drop 
off by hitting 'X' at the next stop, which would be Caraway's Residence.

Talk to the guard on the extreme right: Squall and co. will have to 
prove themselves first by obtaining a password from a nearby dungeon:
- Ready to answer.
- Buy a hint for 3,000 gil. (MIGHT lower SeeD ranking)
- Buy a location displayer for 5,000 gil. *
- Talk.
- Have him escort us out of town.
Well, you really need that displayer, so go on and pay him 5,000 gil. 
Once you're done with that, it's time to explore Deling City.

*the '#' refers to the location of a bridge which appears in the course
 of the events below.

Anyway, head up, and look for a light blue Gunblade on the floor. 
Examine it and record down the (random) password. Write it down on
paper. You can leave now if you want to.

Side events: You'll want to get G.F. 'Brothers' here. From where you 
found that Gunblade, follow the map to get to the Eastern Chamber:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS G.F: Sacred  HP: 2,660  Weak: Poison, Wind  Strong vs.: Earth
                  Draw List: Shell, Protect, Berserk, Life
                  AP: 20

Junction 'Aero' or 'Tornado' to Elemental Attack, then pummel away at 
him. You can also junction 'Float' to Elemental Defense. Heal when 
needed. Make sure to cast 'Float' on Sacred; this cancels his 'Regen'
status. Hit him with your G.Fs if you don't have any wind-based spells
yet. Draw a few Life spells if you can, they junction well to HP.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moving on, head to the Northern Flood Gate, and dis-engage the dam to 
allow the water to flow through via a chain to the upper-right. Make
your way to the Western Chamber; examine the water-wheel to change its 
direction of revolution.

You might want to get out and save after this. Once you're ready, 
approach the center of the Tomb from a South to North direction; a 
bridge would've been laid out, granting you access to the bosses.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS G.F: Sacred  HP: 2,660  Weak: Poison, Wind  Strong vs.: Earth
                  Draw List: Shell, Protect, Berserk, Life
                  AP: 20
BOSS G.F: Minotaur  HP: 3,630  Weak: Poison, Wind  Strong vs.: Earth
                    Draw List: Shell, Protect, Berserk, Double
                    AP: 20

Cast Float on your party as well as the bosses -- this cancels out 
their Regen status and their combination attack (aptly called 'Mad Cow
Special'). As always, junction 'Aero' to Elemental Attack if you can,
and off the big guy first (Sacred), followed by Minotaur. They're
capable of dealing out moderate sums of damage, but shouldn't pose too
much of a threat. Summon your G.Fs too, and heal frequently.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The spirit departs for the nether world, and you'll get G.F. Brothers 
plus 2 pretty good cards. Don't lose them... they'll come in handy 
later on.

G.F Brothers offer HP-J, Str-J and Spr-J. Useful if you want to have
another party member who's adept at physical attacks, I suppose.

A rare enemy here which only appears in parts where the path curves
is the Forbidden (skeleton with 2 swords). He's capable of casting 
Death, but you might want to turn him into a card, upon which 'Card 
Mod.' nets you a 'Betrayal Blade'. Keep one of these. The Forbidden
also drops Betrayal Blades at levels 1 to 19 when defeated.

Another enemy, the shelled Armadodo (Esansuushi), offers Turtle Shells
which you'll have to steal (you should have just about learnt G.F
Diablos' 'Mug' character ability at this point; if you haven't, you
aren't combating enough enemies! Try fighting the Fastitocalon-Fs along
the coasts of Deling City for some A.P). Get 2 of these Turtle Shells.

######################################################################
[Galbadia Region Revisited]

Weapons: Flame Saber (Squall)
         Ulysses (Irvine)
######################################################################

On a side note, if you missed getting the Steel Pipes earlier on,
Wendigos wander the barren (brownish) areas near Deling City. Mug them,
then combine 1 Steel Pipe, 1 Bomb Fragment (modify a lv. 4 Bomb card)
and 2 Screws for Irvine's Ulysses if you haven't already done so.
Wendigos seem to appear more frequently in night-shrouded areas.

You'll want to obtain Squall's 'Flame Saber' now: it requires a 
'Betrayal Blade', a 'Turtle Shell' and 4 Screws. Geezards (Haurizaados)
in the same barren regions as the Wendigos drop Screws. The extra
Turtle Shell I told you to get will be for later. And if you're
wondering what on earth I'm talking about, try referring back to the
section before this for the locations of the raw materials.

######################################################################
2e. [Deling City Revisited: Prelude to Edea's Parade]

Magazine: Weapons Monthly May (Sewers)
Weapons: Maverick (Zell)
         Cutting Trigger (Squall)
######################################################################

Tell the guard the password, then enter General Caraway's Mansion.
Rinoa gets impatient while waiting and leaves to look for him, telling
Squall not to follow her:
- ... An order?
- Meaning...? *
The decision point does not appear in the U.S version.

The party meets up with General Caraway (Rinoa's dad) eventually. He'll
request Squall to keep Rinoa out of this mission before he starts the
briefing. Basically, you have to divide yourselves into 2 groups:
Sniper Team: Squall & Irvine
Gateway Team: Quistis, Zell & Selphie

Caraway then outlines the mission steps:
1. Sniper Team to wait outside Presidential Residence before the
   parade.
2. Gateway Team to wait inside Arch of Triumph.
3. Parade commences, Edea leaves; Sniper Team to sneak into Presidential
   Residence, and lie in ambush from atop.
4. Edea's float passes underneath Arch; Gateway Team to activate gates, 
   cutting parade movement off.
5. Commence assassination. Hand-to-hand combat if assassination fails.

You can hang around Deling City if you like, before proceeding to 
Caraway's Mansion.

On a side note, you should have 4 decent cards at hand now: Ifrit's,
Diablos' and the Brothers'. Try playing some of the locals to win Grendel
(lv. 2 cards depicting a beaked yellow monster with a blue back) and
lv. 2 Mesmerize (pink horned horse-like creatures) cards. They can be
modified via Quezacotl's 'Card Mod.' menu ability to obtain a 'Dragon 
Fin' and a 'Mesmerize Blade' respectively.

If you can't seem to find a Grendel card, you'll get your Dragon Fins
later on in Disc Two. However, you should be able to win a few 
lv. 2 Buel (ugly faces with spinning fins around them) cards. You've
encountered them before, in the Fire Caverns and Tomb of the Unknown
King. Modify 2 of these cards into 2 'Magic Stones'.

Match a 'Dragon Fin' with a 'Spider Web' to upgrade Zell's weapon. 
You can also link up a 'Mesmerize Blade' with 8 Screws for Squall's 
'Cutting Trigger', a weaker version of his 'Flame Saber'. Head for 
Caraway's Mansion when you're ready.

And no, even though the name suggests it, I doubt the 'Flame Saber'
does Fire-Elemental damage to enemies.

[Caraway's Mansion]
Rinoa suggests using a magical artefact which can supposedly curb
Edea's powers; Quistis dismisses the idea furiously, saying that 'it's
not a game'. The party then leaves, sans Rinoa. Follow Caraway.

<!> Tip:
After Caraway leads Quistis' party to the Gateway, he seems to
disappear into thin air. Actually, if you look hard enough, he's
walking among the crowd, towards the direction of the Presidential
Residence. Some gamers have difficulty distinguishing him, probably
attributed to the nature of his dark-coloured clothes. Follow him
with Squall's party.

[Arch of Triumph]
Quistis wonders whether she was too harsh with Rinoa, and decides to 
apologise to the latter. Return to Caraway's Mansion. (you don't have 
to junction your G.Fs yet).

[Presidential Residence] (note: You might want to junction Rinoa for a
                          while)
Save as Rinoa, then look for a manhole to the right. Descend into 
the sewers using it, then head left to pick up the May issue of Weapons 
Monthly. Return to the previous save point afterwards. Climb the 
various crates to get to the top. Follow the path (there's a ladder to 
the left) to the roof-top. 

[Caraway's Mansion]
After that little twist, have Quistis examine the painting beside 
Selphie, then pick up a glass cup from the shelves on the left. Head 
into the leftmost background, and set the cup on the statue. 

Descend into the sewers, ride the waterwheel on the left of the 
screen, and keep heading upwards.

#######################################################################
2f. [The Parade Commences -- Presidential Residence]

Enemies: Creeps, Red Bat, Grand Mantis (Sewers)
Draw Points: Esuna, Zombie, Bio (Sewers)
G.F: Carbuncle (Iguion)
Magazines: Weapons Monthly May (Sewers)
Blue Magic: Electrocute OR LV?Death
Weapons: Slaying Tail (Quistis)
         Morning Star (Selphie)
######################################################################

You'll take control of Squall from here. Follow Irvine (junction your 
G.Fs afterwards), save, then climb the crates in the same way you did 
with Rinoa. If you didn't get the May issue of Weapons Monthly from the
sewers using Rinoa, you can do it now too. Head straight for Edea's
Room to find Rinoa.

<!> Tip:
Be sure to have either Squall or Irvine equipped with the 'Draw'
command; you'll need to acquire a G.F soon.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSSES: Iguion x2  HP: 1,151  Weak: Earth, Holy  
                   Strong vs.: Fire, Poison
                   Draw List: Esuna, Cure, (Break), Carbuncle
                   AP: 10

Draw G.F. Carbuncle from these guys first (last option in draw menu), 
then quickly dispatch one of them as they can hit you with Resonance, a 
combination attack. Other offensive moves include Magma Breath (easily 
countered by drawing Esuna from them) which slowly petrifies your 
members. Use G.F. Brothers against them.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Carbuncle offers a character the ability to junction spells to Status
Attack and Defense. Try sticking a 'Sleep', 'Stop' or 'Death' spell
to Status Attack; it works pretty well against common enemies.

Retrace your steps to the corridor in the previous screen, and open the
hatch in the floor to the right. Go down and collect the rifle there.

[Deling Sewers] (note: Junction G.Fs)
The sewers may seem long and intimidating, but what you really have 
to do here is to simply follow the path (there's always only 1 or 2 
routes open to you at each point) until you loop around to get back 
to your original starting point, which is the ladder you climbed
down from previously to get to the Sewers. 

Push the ladders down on the way, and use only waterwheels that spin 
clockwise to make your way through. Some gates you'll have to open
with the 'X' (U.S) or 'Circle' (Japanese) button. I'll give you the
quickest way through:

1. Follow the 1 way trail until you reach a ladder which you can
   collapse. You can cross it to reach a 'Esuna' Draw Point, but you'll
   have to retrace your steps back to the collapsed ladder.
2. Moving on, the party will pass an unusable waterwheel, followed by a 
   ridable one. Head left first before riding it if you so wish for a 
   'Zombie' DP. There's also a 'Bio' DP south of the waterwheel.
3. The previous waterwheel will carry you over to the other side, to yet
   another wheel. Jump onto this one. Follow the path south and cross 
   the upcoming 2 waterwheels.
4. Collapse the next ladder you see... and you're back where you started 
   from. Head right from where you felled that ladder to another wheel. 
5. Ride it, follow the trail and loop around at the end to save. Climb 
   the nearby ladder to reach the upper levels of the Arch of Triumph.

Side events: Creeps (black shadows with 2 red eyes) offer 2 treasures: 
some drop Curse Spikes (at levels 20-29) which net you Quistis' 
'Level ? Death' and weaker ones drop Coral Fragments, which earns you 
'Electrocute', yet another Blue Magic. You can learn 'LV?Death' later
on in Disc Two, though.

Those who find themselves missing the Coral Fragments can obtain it 
via 'Card Mod.' Menu Ability, from Creeps' cards. 

Another creature lurks only in the stairway leading to the sewers: 
Grand Mantis, a huge scorpion-like monster. You can steal Sharp Spikes 
from it, opening access to weapon upgrades for Quistis (the Slaying
Tail; 2 Magic Stones and 2 Sharp Spikes) and Selphie (the Morning Star; 
2 Steel Orbs from the Wendigo or by modifying its card and 1 Sharp 
Spike). You can't get to a Junk Store for now, but hold on to those
items. Btw, save an extra Sharp Spike for later, too.

[The Galbadia Parade]
When Zell tells you to, control Quistis and hit the control panel to 
the left to drop the gates. However, Irvine shows his weak side at this 
crucial point, and finally Squall coaxes him into firing the decisive 
shot. Junction G.Fs to your characters now.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS: Seifer  HP: 870  Weak: Poison  
              Draw List: Fire, Cure, Life  AP: 0

Steal Hero's Medicine or Holy War Medicine (it's all random) from him. 
Other than that, you may want to junction Fire to Elemental Defense for 
Squall before taking on Seifer. The latter also has Life magic, which 
I suggest you draw and stock. Other than that, hit him with G.Fs or the 
Gunblade for a quick kill.

Hero's Medicine is simply known as 'Hero' in the U.S version. Same
thing for Holy War Medicine (Holy War). One more thing: 'Raise' has
been translated as 'Life' in the U.S version.

BOSS: Edea  HP: 6,700  Draw List: Cura, Dispell, Life, Double
            AP: 20
 
Edea's arsenal consists of various level 3 elemental spells, so minimise 
damage with Shell magic. You can also cast Carbuncle G.F, thus resulting 
in Edea using Dispell to break your 'Reflect' status. Take this 
opportunity to attack her, or to draw Double magic from her. A bit on 
the difficult side, but she has friendly drawable spells such as Cura 
and Life, which you can exploit to your own advantage.

3a. [Laguna Dream Sequence Part Three: Winhill]

Enemies: Bite Bug, Caterchipillar
Draw Points: Curaga, Dispel, Drain, Reflect
#######################################################################

Ellone comes to inform Laguna that a visitor is waiting for him at 
Raine's pub. Head on over there, where Kiros will make an appearance:
- (What's Ward up to?)
- (Tell me about Julia.)
- (...Where am I?)
- (Let's talk later...)

*spoiler here... skip this paragraph if you wish*
Laguna learns that Ward has quit the army and found a new cleaning job 
at D-District Prison, and of Julia marrying a certain Caraway after
Laguna failed to return.

Soon, Laguna has to leave for his daily patrols -- Kiros decides to 
join him. Junction your party before setting off.

Make your way to the southern-most edge of the village, and along the
way Kiros finds out Laguna's doing this to repay the residents who
helped him when he was brought in seriously injured. Kiros suggests an
alternate job at Timber Maniacs, which Laguna shows some interest in.

Retrace your steps back to the pub when you're done, where you'll hear 
a bit about Raine's feelings towards Laguna. Return to Laguna's 
residence thereafter.

Side events: The Caterchipillars here should net you Spider Webs if you 
missed them the first time around. Same thing with the Bite Bugs and 
their Magic Stones.

#######################################################################
3b. [D-District Prison]

Enemies: Guard, Elite Soldier, GIM47N, GIM52A, Geezard, Thrustaevis,
         Wendigo
Draw Points: Berserk, Thundaga
Magazines: Combat King 001 (1st Floor)
Blue Magic: Micro Missile
######################################################################

Zell awakens in the same cell as Quistis, Selphie and Rinoa. Talk to
everyone. And as for Squall, the wound has strangely disappeared, but
in comes Seifer to mess things up.

The scene will then alternate between Zell's party and Squall.

[D-District Prison: Cell]
The scene shifts to Zell and company again - should they help the 
Moomba?
- I'll stop him! *
- There's no use...

[D-District Prison: Torture Chamber]
Seifer questions Squall as to the real intention behind SeeD. Befuddled, 
Squall can only repeat in his mind what he knows: SeeD is a military 
group comprising of elite Garden graduates. Squall'll have to make a 
decision:
- ... Just let me die. *
- ... I'll lie... I must... live...

[D-District Prison]
Zell decides to try his luck at breaking out. Starting from the 7th 
floor (remember to junction your G.Fs!), head up one level to encounter 
2 guards. You know what to do with them, don't you? 

Another battle awaits with 2 old friends as well after you recover 
your weapons, and head back to the prison cell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUB-BOSSES: Biggs  HP: 2,130  Weak: Poison
                   Draw List: Cura, Haste, Slow, Regen
            Wedge  HP: 2,040  Weak: Poison
                   Draw List: Fira, Shell, Protect, Reflect
                   Total AP: 10

Spend some time drawing Regen and Reflect from them (the former works
well junctioned with HP; the latter junctioned to Spirit), and mug them
for a few decent items, too. Try casting 'Confuse' on them if you have
it, and watch their reactions should one of them attack the other ^_^
Send them to their doom with your G.Fs.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, you're left with 2 options after the fight: to go up or down. 
Going down results in a dead-end, but you'll find 'Combat King 
001' way down at level one, plus a few other goodies on the way in the
various prison cells. It's impossible to return here later, so you'll
have to make the trip now.

Floor 7: Here's where you start.
Floor 6: Just a save point here.
Floor 5: A man will play cards with you here.
Floor 4: Check the cells for a Tent.
Floor 3: There's also treasure here (a Pet House).
Floor 2: And here as well (a Pet Name Tag and a Str Up).
Floor 1: Save point, plus Combat King 001 in 2 separate cells.

Now make your way up again.

Floor  8: A man will sell you items here.
Floor  9: A Berserk draw point can be found here.
Floor 10: You can save or do Card Battle with a man here.
          (refer to Side events section)
Floor 11: A Thundaga D.P plus a chance to play cards.
Floor 12: Nothing here.
Floor 13: Head on over to the Torture Room to meet up with Squall.

If you refused to surrender as Squall, one of the Moombas in the
Torture Room will offer to remove one of the barriers on a certain
floor of the prison; choose the option for the 4th floor.

Side events: Mug the yellow GIM47N for Steel Orbs, whereas the (rare)
blue GIM52A nets you Missiles. These can be used to grant Quistis her
'Micro Missile' Blue Magic, which is deadly when used against enemies 
with high HPs. Both robots are weak against Thunder, by the way.

Winning at Card Battle against the player on the 10th floor lets you 
upgrade your 'Battle Report' system in the Tutorial screen. Basically,
this opens up a 'Character Report' section. You can only get it
upgraded here, but it really isn't vital to do so.

[D-District Prison: 13th Floor]
Zell will assist in controlling the movement of the Arm; ride it to 
the bottom (hit the red switch when Zell tells you to). 

Examine the door at the end of the passageway on the bottom level;
well, it appears to be a dead-end, so return to the Arm. The scene will
shift over to Zell.

You'll have to escape from the guards using Zell alone. Keep him well
-junctioned with G.Fs prior to this, and run in a clockwise direction.

The 6 are reunited; Rinoa however, is annoyed Irvine took his time
deciding to come. Either way, you'll have to divide yourselves into 2
groups.

Squall's party will simply have to keep heading upwards; do the 
opposite for Irvine's. When you finally reach the 14th floor as Squall, 
use Siren's 'Move-Find' party ability to find a secret save point.
Remember to keep everyone well-junctioned!

Oh, and be sure to talk to any Moombas you find on your way up. They'll 
give Squall some items. Head all the way to the lower-right on the 
15th floor as Squall.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS: Elite Soldier  HP: 415  Weak: Poison  
                     Draw List: Fire, Thunder, Blizzard, Scan  AP: 2
BOSSES: GIM52A x2  HP: 2,426  Weak: Thunder, Earth, Water  
                   Strong vs.: Poison
                   Draw List: Haste, Slow, Dispell  AP: 3

You might want to junction Thundara to Elemental Attack, and off the
Elite Soldier first. Use Quezacotl against the GIM52As and attack them
with thunder-based damage. Watch out for their Micro Missiles, which
drains half a character's current HP. You can break their 'Aura' or
'Protect' status at the start via drawing and using Dispell on them.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now return to the previous screen to examine the controls panel in the 
upper-right. Irvine will instruct Squall here. 

Go back downstairs to save, then head upstairs again to the bridge
in the lower-right. Cross it, and when the bridge starts to retract,
run Squall towards a safe spot.

The D-District Prison begins to sink; quickly maneuver Squall by simply
holding on to right on the d-pad when he gets cut off from the others.
Once out of danger's harm, the party leaves via stolen buggies.

#######################################################################
3c. [Galbadian Desert]

Draw Point: Aero
#######################################################################

The first batch of missiles have been fired at Trabia Garden, with 
Balamb Garden being targeted next for destruction. Again, you'll have 
to split up: Squall heads the team to return to Balamb Garden to warn 
of the impending attack; Selphie's party is to infiltrate the Missile 
Base to try prevent the second batch of missiles from being launched.

I suggest you take your weaker characters with Squall, which in my 
case were Rinoa and Irvine. His scenario is the harder of the 2, but 
provides a greater opportunity to gain some levels. 

[Squall's Scenario Part One: Galbadia Desert Train Station]
Sneak off onto the train to your left at the station. Rinoa apologises 
to the Galbadian soldier as he attempts a futile chase after them.

[Selphie's Scenario: Galbadia Desert]
Return to Deling City first to restock your supplies and remodel your
weapons.

#######################################################################
3d. [Missile Base] (note: It's to the north-west of D-District Prison)

Enemies: G-Soldier, Elite Soldier, Geezard, SAM08G
Draw Points: Full-life, Blind, Blizzara
Magazines: Weapons Monthly June (BGH251F2)
#######################################################################

Drive the car into the base, alight, then head on over to the structure 
to the left. Save and proceed to examine the terminal between the 2
doors... the left door should open. Enter.

Selphie and company will come across a guard outside the Circuit 
room -- choose the 2nd option to walk. After the short scare sequence, 
proceed further to reach another save point. Head to the lower left 
(there's a passage to the left of the stairs) of the screen.

Talk to the 2 soldiers you find to the right, then return to the 
previous save point. There'll be a door marked Launcher Lift to the 
right; enter it and talk to the guards within. Tell them that they 
have to leave for the Circuit room themselves (1st option). Btw,
there's a 'Full-life' Draw Point in here.

Retrace your steps back to the original 2 soldiers mentioned above, but 
they'll be unable to carry out the assigned task as well. Selphie will 
be asked to go in their place.

You can now enter the Circuit room. Selphie will screw around with
the controls a bit (select the 1st option, followed by the 2nd, then
then bash away using 'Square'), cutting off power to the base. 

Leave -- you'll have to respond to the guards outside:
- (What the heck! Let's FIGHT!)
- (... Try to talk my way out.) *
Selphie wonders what to say:
- (We just got here.) 
- (We were just about to go call on you.) *
Follow the guards into the Circuit room for a pummeling session,
courtesy of Selphie and company.

Head back to the Launcher Lift door, and attempt to enter it. A guard
should stop you; choose the 1st option both times at the guard to gain
access. 

Position Selphie in between the 2 soldiers pushing against the load,
then mash away at the 'Square' button to move the launcher unit in
place.

Now you get to toy around with the control panels outside; they're 
located underneath the red light, to the right of the Launcher Lift 
door.

Verify the Equipment (it should be BAG0003A cruise missiles) and Set
Target. Next shift the Error Ratio to the maximum, before Uploading the 
Data to the main terminal. Run a Simulation test, then exit the system.

There's a little gimmick here... at the Equipment screen in the system,
hold down both the 'Square' and 'Triangle' buttons, then press up or
down on the d-pad to get a dancing Galbadian trooper. Weird.

Save before proceeding to the Controls room, south-east of the control
panels. Talk to the guard there to get past him.

SUB-BOSSES: Base Soldier x2  HP: 781  Weak: Poison
                             Draw List: Blizzard, Silence, Confuse
SUB-BOSS: Base Leader  HP: 1,005  Weak: Poison
                       Draw List: Thunder, Confuse, Slow, Reflect
                       Total AP: 4

They're capable of casting status ailment spells on your characters, 
but just draw Reflect to protect yourselves. Not too tough.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Check the panels to the right, middle and left to stop the launch. Go 
through the door in the right background, then examine the terminal to
the upper left. Activate the self-destruct sequence and set time to 20
minutes. The door to the lower-right of the screen should become usable,
allowing for a short-cut (this only happens when you select 20 minutes
or below). Leave the base.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS: BGH251F2  HP: 8,200  Weak: Thunder, Earth, Water  
                Strong vs.: Poison
                Draw List: Shell, Protect, Stop  AP: 20

Junction Thundara, Quake or Water to elemental attack to 2 offensive 
orientated characters, and have the remaining one cast Quezacotl. 
Once you destroy some of the pillar-like structures on it, the BGH251F2
will retaliate with Beam Cannon, so watch your HPs. Draw Protect and
Shell if you so wish to cut down on damage taken.

Once the BGH251F2 is effectively put out of action, you'll have to
combat 2 Galbadian Soldiers and an Elite Soldier, so save some time to
spare on them. The whole fight should take you no more than 10 minutes.

Basically, if the G.F. summoning character has a high Magic rating and 
affiliation with Quezacotl, this battle shouldn't give you too much 
problems. The 'Boost' G.F. ability, coupled with a turbo controller 
works fine too. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

You'll get your June issue of Weapons Monthly after this fight, and if 
you successfully bluffed your way through in the Base, your SeeD Ranking 
will also be raised by 2.

<For those who blew their cover>
Yes, it is possible to so in the Missile Base. Mess up, that is. If
you should get busted, simply head for the Controls room, activate
the self-destruct sequence, then make a run for the exit. I advise
you have Diablos' 'Encounter None' party ability equipped first.

Upon reaching the exit, Selphie will insist on shutting down the
missile launch system; head back to the Launcher Lift door to find a
wounded soldier, who'll give you his ID card and password (he won't
appear if you don't attempt to escape first) if you answer his
question using the 1st option.

Examine the controls panel nearby, then enter 'EDEA' as the password,
and make the necessary adjustments. Leave the base.

3e. [Squall's Scenario Part Two: Takeover at Balamb Garden]

Enemies: Bite Bug, Glacial Eye, Caterchipillar, Bomb, Grat, T-Rexaur,
         Granaldo, Grendel (Balamb Garden)
         Buel, Blood Soul, Blobra, Tri-Face (M.D Level)
Draw Points: Cure, Esuna, Demi, Blizzard,, Full-life
Blue Magic: LV?Death
Weapon: Maverick (Zell)
#######################################################################

Talk to the Garden Faculty, who'll question Squall's allegiance. Select 
the 2nd option, which results in a pretty easy fight. Proceeding 
further into Balamb Garden, the party'll chance upon Raijin and Fujin, 
who explain that the Master Party is attempting a takeover of Balamb 
Garden.

Squall has to look for Cid, so start your search in a clockwise 
direction. Remember to rest up and save when you reach Squall's room. 

The enemies you encounter here can be difficult. In clockwise order:

Infirmary: 1 Granaldo.
Quad: 1 Glacial Eye and 1 Bomb.
Cafeteria: 1 Bomb. This one holds the 'Meltdown' spell; draw a few
           of them before killing it.
Dormitory: 1 Caterchipillar. Rest up and save here.
Parking Lots: 1 Grendel. Mug it to get Dragon Fins; now you can
              remodel Zell's weapon (1 Dragon Fin, 1 Spider Web).
Training Center: 1 T-Rexaur. Cast Blind, followed by Shiva's Doom
                 command ability or G.F Shiva.
Library: 1 Grat. 

Some of the students here will give away items as gratitude, so be
sure to talk to them. You should reply with the 1st option prior to
all the fights. Incidentally, all the battles in the 7 facilities on
the 1st floor of Balamb Garden have to be triggered before the
following event occurs:

Returning back to the Main Lobby, Squall spots Xu entering the lift. 
Tail her to the 2nd floor corridor, where Squall will inform her of 
the ensuing missile attack. She suggests taking this matter to Cid 
on the 3rd floor, so off you go.

Cid recalls a device in the M.D Level of Balamb Garden which might
protect it from the missiles. Squall promptly takes up the idea, and
Cid gives him the key to the basement. Take the elevators.

[Balamb Garden M.D Level]
Check out the control panels after the lift hangs, then the floor 
plate in the upper left to escape. The path ahead is pretty much 
one-way... you'll eventually enter a door to find a mounted wheel. 

Squall has to turn it within 10 seconds (mash away at the 'Square' 
button), but you'll probably need 2 persons to actually succeed. 
Exit back to the previous screen and climb down the newly uncovered 
ladder.

You should come across a huge pillar structure (and an Full-life draw 
point). Head left, where Squall has 3 choices as to who'll scout 
out the place:
- (We have no choice, let's go.)
- (I'll go check it out.) *
- (Someone else go check it out.)
Ascend the ladder, then activate the green controls panel to the right
when you reach the Switch room. Use the same ladder (1st option) to
get out.

Irvine will comment that that was a close shave:
- (Yeah.)
- (Kind of.)
- (No.)
I'll leave this up to you. Next, examine the green light near the 
railings to open a path downwards. Descend and save, then throw the 
nearby switch to open the gate in the background. Proceed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSSES: Oilboyle x2  HP: 4,035  Weak: Fire  Strong vs.: Water
                     Draw List: Esuna, Blind, Cura, Confuse  AP: 20

Summon Ifrit to make short work of them. If you do receive any maladies 
from them, draw and use Esuna to cure. They're pretty fast, so you might 
want to cast 'Slow' on them if your character has a poor affiliation 
with Ifrit. Watch your HPs.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Go through the door, down the ladder, and then move left. Examine the 
middle panel and you're done.

Side events: The rare Tri-Faces here (3-headed purple nasties) have 
Curse Spikes which can be obtained via mugging. These give you Quistis' 
'Level ? Death'. All enemies in the M.D are weak against Fire, so you 
might want to set fire spells to Elemental Attack.

#######################################################################
3f. [Mobile Balamb Garden]

Draw Points: Bio
G.Fs: Leviathan (Norg)
Rare Cards: Seifer (Cid)
#######################################################################

Make your way to the end of the corridor on the 2nd floor to reach the
2F Deck, then head to the 3F Command Bridge when Xu tells you to.

If you have Rinoa in your party, you'll get an additional FMV scene
earlier on, plus a small event afterwards which I'll outline below:

Rinoa enters Squall's room to take a peek at the latter sleeping. When 
he awakens, she requests for a tour around Balamb Garden, which Squall 
obliges. 

Of course, Squall's robotic-like style of explaining the various 
facilities leaves Rinoa quite amused... Dr. Kadowaki at the infirmary 
will teasingly question Squall if he's taking a stroll with his 
girlfriend:
- Yes.
- No, just showing her around. *
I think you'd better be honest here ^_^ Head to the Main Lobby when 
you're done. A Garden Faculty will instruct Squall to head to the 
Master Room for an audience with the Master (duh), so take the 
elevators to the basement.

<!> Tip:
You'll want to have someone equipped with the 'Draw' command if you're
looking to acquire another G.F soon.

[Balamb Garden Basement: Master Room] (note: You can save, if you want
                                       to, before tackling this event.)

*major spoiler here... skip this paragraph if you wish*
The Master is furious that Squall has failed in his assassination 
attempt, and blames the party for the earlier missile attack, which
was undoubtedly Edea's idea of taking revenge. Norg plans to appease 
Edea by killing off SeeD, its members, and her husband, Headmaster Cid 
of Balamb Garden...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS: NORG Pod (Center)  HP: 2,000  
                         Strong vs.: Thunder, Poison
                         Draw List: Cura
BOSS: Right Orb  HP: 2,701  Strong vs.: All Elements 
                 Draw List: Dispell, Confuse, Slow
BOSS: Left Orb  HP: 2,701  Strong vs.: All Elements
                Draw List: Thundara, Life, Bio  
BOSS: NORG  HP: 11,900  Weak: Wind  Strong vs.: Poison, Thunder
            Draw List: Shell, Protect, Esuna, Leviathan
            Total AP: 20

Initially, NORG will not be directly in the fray of the battle. Rather, 
have 2 members attack the 2 orbs to keep them from turning red (they're 
capable of some pretty nasty spells if they're that colour), leaving 
Squall to destroy the NORG Pod of the machine. I'll suggest you 
'Mug' the 2 eyes, as they offer items which can boost your Magic and
Spirit rating.

Either way, once the NORG Pod is nullified, NORG will reveal himself; 
draw G.F. Leviathan from him first, then follow up with a multitude of 
wind-based spells, Demi magic or G.Fs.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

G.F. Leviathan has the 'Recover' command ability, which heals a
single character in battle back to maximum HP for free.

[Balamb Garden]
Cid's not in his room; you can find him at the infirmary, where Squall 
can ask him more about the events which had just transpired:
- (I want to make a report.)
- (The real meaning of SeeD.)
- (About sorceress Edea.)
- (About Master Norg.)
- (About what to do next.)  

*spoiler here... skip this paragraph if you wish*
Cid reveals that both Garden and SeeD were Edea's ideas before she 
became a sorceress, and are sponsored by Norg, a rich Shumi. SeeD's 
actual purpose is to defeat the sorceress of each era, and now it has
come down to this... Cid plans to restore order back to Balamb Garden
before anything else.

Return to the Main Lobby's Directory Board to meet up with Xu; Squall
decides to check things out when a mysterious ship is sighted
approaching Balamb Garden. Head to the 2nd Floor Deck.

The SeeD members on board the ship asks of Squall to locate Ellone -- 
she can be found at the Library. When Squall asks about the dreams of 
Laguna, Ellone can only offer one hint: that was in the past.

The next day, Rinoa arrives to offer some comfort to Squall. Take the 
1st option to stroll with her. You'll have to head to the 3rd floor 
after the collision; Cid dispatches Squall to survey the streets of 
Fishermans Horizon, as well as to apologize to the Mayor. Make your
way to the 2F Deck. Incidentally, Cid holds Seifer's card; be sure to
win it from him (he's rather good at Card Battle though...).

          Garden     Perch

Along the path, you should spot a ladder (it's kinda hard to see, 
actually) leading downwards. Descend from there and follow the trail to 
an elderly gentleman, who's a bit annoyed with the crash. Choose to 
apologize to him (1st option) for the 3rd Volume of Occult Fans.
Converse with the Master Fisherman again; he'll ask of a favour from
Squall.

Return to the original path and take the crane. The Mayor's house lies
right in the center of the solar dish, but I suggest you take a right
1st to explore the streets.

Pick up an issue of 'Timber Maniacs' at the Repair Shop, which is the
shack at the side of the route leading to the fenced-off highway, and
yet another issue on the 2nd floor of the F.H Hotel.

And head for the Docks for an amusing scene with the Fisherkid and
the owner of the Junk Store.

Save before meeting up with Mayor Dobe, but he'll greet Squall with a
cold reception before bundling them out of the house. Be sure to draw
'Ultima' from a hidden draw point found here. Dobe also holds G.F.
Quezacotl's card.

F.H will be under siege by the Galbadian army just as Squall leaves. 
Retrace your steps back to the Mayor's house to obtain more information.

Save your game, and run around to encounter a few SAM08Gs. Mug
Running Fires (Fang Machine Guns) from them. These give you Quistis'
'Gatling Gun' Blue Magic. You can also refine a single 'Running Fire'
to 40 Demolition Ammo using Ifrit's 'Refine Ammo' menu ability.

Head on over to the Plaza in front of the Train Station:
- (Go help.) *
- (Listen a little longer.)
Squall will have to contend with a few Galbadian soldiers, but they 
offer little resistance. Their demise heralds the arrival of a very 
familiar boss...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS: BGH251F2  HP: 6,900  Weak: Thunder, Earth, Water  
                Strong vs.: Poison
                Draw List: Shell, Protect, Stop  AP: 20

Use Quezacotl, Leviathan on it and any Thunder based spells. Steal
Adamantine from it as well. This should be a snap. There's a chance of
halting most of its attacks if you manage to successfully cast 'Blind'
on it.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The gang is reunited here... and Squall lets slip his relief at seeing 
the trio from the Missile Base safe. Rinoa comments that that was very 
nice of Squall (even though unusual!):
- (It's because I felt responsible.)
- (I was really glad to see them.) *
- (It didn't mean anything.)
You might want to share a few words with Mayor Dobe as well -- it's
the 1st, then the 2nd choice to keep the conversation going.

Talk to Grease Monkey at the Repair Shop, then head for the Docks
for yet another scene with the Fisherkid. Save your game, and ride
the Crane back up. You can go back to Balamb Garden if you so wish.

Side events: After meeting up with Irvine, go speak with the Master
Fisherman (the one who gave you Volume III of Occult Fans) who's still
at his fishing; he'll ask of Squall to meet him at the Hotel.

Return to F.H, but head for the Plaza in front of the Train Station.
If you previously conversed with the Cafeteria Lady at Balamb Garden
up to the point when she mentions her son, talk to the man in a white
shirt and blue trousers here thrice:
- (Isn't he Dr. Kadowaki's son?)
- (Isn't he the cafeteria lady's son?) *
- (Isn't he Xu's son?)

Go to the Repair Shop for a scene with a Galbadian Officer. Leave the
Shop and re-enter, then talk to Grease Monkey for a 'Mega Phoenix'.

Make your way to the 2nd Floor of F.H. Hotel. You'll view a very
interesting holographic display involving Dobe and Fishermans Horizon
there. Choose to accompany the Master Fisherman a bit longer (2nd
option).

Head for the Docks for a small event, and agree with the Master
Fisherman's opinions (1st option) during the course of the scene. Talk
to him afterwards and pick the 2nd option for a Megalixir.

#######################################################################
3h. [Balamb Garden: Garden Festival]
#######################################################################

Locate Selphie at the Quad:
- (Cheer her up.) *
- (Let Irvine handle it.)
Meet up with Cid now, where he'll confer the status of 'Commander' 
to Squall, much to the latter's exasperation.

[Fishermans Horizon] 
Squall's friends decide to hold a small concert for him, and you have 
3 tunes (and 8 instruments!) to choose from:
- Guitar
- Saxophone
- Electric Guitar
- Piano
- Violin
- Flute
- Bass Guitar
- Tap Dance

Tune A: Guitar, Violin, Flute, Tap Dance *
Tune B: Electric Guitar, Bass Guitar, Saxophone, Piano
Tune C: Any jumble of the 8 instruments other than the 2 above

Using Irvine, pick Tune A as your performance piece. Incidentally, you
can run off in the midst of this scene to visit the rest of F.H.

[Balamb Garden]
Rinoa invites Squall to the concert:
- (... I'm not in the mood.)
- (... I don't know.) *
Make your way to F.H.

[Fishermans Horizon]
You can hit 'Square' to change the view at the stage, or simply 
proceed right to move the plot. Whichever tune you chose determines 
the outcome of the conversation between Rinoa and Squall.

Tune A (folk song): A smooth ride, no misunderstandings.
Tune B (ballad): A bit uneasy, but still okay.
Tune C (jumble): Both Squall and Rinoa feel uncomfortable.

*spoiler here... skip this paragraph if you wish*
Rinoa tries to convince Squall that the people around him genuinely 
want to help him, but Squall still feels that he doesn't need to depend 
on others, fearing that the blow will be too great to take if he loses 
them. Rinoa tells him then to cherish every moment when his friends are 
around... and not too worry too much about what's to come. This 
seemingly softens Squall a bit; Rinoa assures him this is really how 
they feel about him right now.

[Balamb Garden]
You'll have to make another trip to the 3rd floor Bridge, upon which
the next destination will be decided: Balamb City. Talk to Nida to get
things moving.

I suggest you check out a few previously unreachable areas prior to 
Balamb City.

<Piloting Balamb Garden>
While not exactly the best air-ship you've ever encountered before in
the Final Fantasy series (it's way too sluggish, takes up too much 
space and has atrocious climbing abilities -- read: none at all), 
Balamb Garden will be your main mode of transport until you reach the 
later parts of Disc Three. The controls are:

For the U.S version:

D-pad/Left Analog-Stick: Changes direction ship is facing
Right Analog-Stick: Moves ship forward or backward
Start: Brings up the bar that toggles the rumble feature on/off and
       pauses the game
Select: Toggles the World Sphere/Map on/off
X: Dismount from the ship
Triangle: Reverses ship
Square: Accelerates ship
Circle: Return to 3F Command Center of Balamb Garden
R1: Rotates the camera clockwise
L1: Rotates the camera anti-clockwise
R2: Switches between view points

#######################################################################

You'll find 2 children playing at the bridge, above the railway track 
which runs towards the East Academy Station and Dollet. Sometimes 
you'll find the girl on the track; when Squall approaches her, the 
sound of a train heralds impending doom for the girl... until Squall 
saves her. You'll be back at the Hotel after the rescue, but get 
nothing for your efforts. Well, except maybe for the warm, fuzzy 
feeling that you've made a difference in someone else's life...

Pick up a copy of Timber Maniacs from the Hotel here if you have yet
to do so.

You can also plunder a measly 500 Gil from 'Owl's Tears' now. Have 
Squall repeatedly examine the cupboard underneath the television. You
can do without this, though.

Also, pick up 'Girl Next Door' from the Timber Maniacs Building if 
you haven't done so already.

The chap outside the Timber Maniacs Building has something to give you
if you encouraged him to go for his dreams of becoming a journalist
previously: a Pet Nametag.

Draw Points: Curaga, Dispell, Reflect, Drain
########################################################################

This quiet rustic town is located to the south of the Galbadian 
continent, not far from D-District Prison and Timber. Winhill offers
only one optional event: The Fragments of the Vase. Initiate this event
by talking to the owner of the mansion north of the town. He can be
found on the stairs.

1st piece: Repeatedly examine the suit of armour in the mansion, which 
           is to the left of the huge flower pot. The small chicobo 
           within should give up the 1st piece. You must re-enter
           this mansion with Irvine in your party to trigger this
           event.

2nd piece: Follow the old lady into her flower shop, and reply 'yes' 
           (1st option) when she asks Squall whether he likes flowers. 
           Locate the 2nd piece among the flowers in the foreground.

3rd piece: At the Chocobo Crossing sign mid-way through the town, you 
           can bully the small chicobo by hitting the 'X' (U.S) button
           or 'Circle' (Japanese) button when it's at your feet. It'll
           throw up a variety of items each time you do that; one of
           them should be a vase piece.

4th piece: Go back to Raine's apartment. Squall should talk to the new 
           owner on the 2nd floor twice before returning to the bar on 
           the 1st floor. Search the cups on the tables, and Raine's 
           spirit should appear. Examine the cat afterwards for the 
           final fragment.

You'll get a rather lame gift for this event: 1 Holy Stone from the 
mansion owner.

Side events: The Vysage (Baiseeji Hands) are rare enemies which
sometimes can be found on the outskirts of Winhill. They're capable of
casting high level spells such as Meteor, Tornado and Quake, but G.F.
Siren's 'Silent Voice' should render them helpless.

Steal Life Rings from the left hand (Lefty, to be exact). Under Siren's
'Life Magic Refinement' menu ability, each one of them gives you 20 Life
spells. Try junctioning this to Status Defense or HP.

You might encounter a seemingly invisible adversary while combating
the enemies in the Winhill region; it's an UFO, actually. I'll detail
this side event later on in Disc Three.

3k. [Balamb City under Siege] (note: You should probably take Zell along
                                     for this event)

Enemies: G-Soldier
Draw Points: Cure, Thunder
G.Fs: Pandemona (Fujin)
Magazines: Combat King 002 (Raijin, Fujin)
Rare Cards: Zell (Ma Dincht)
            Pandemona (Hotel Owner)
########################################################################

The Galbadian sentry lets Squall through on account that the latter has 
information regarding Ellone. Check out the houses here (especially
Zell's) before proceeding to Balamb Hotel. Talk to the guards there.

It seems that you'll need to find the Captain 1st. Head to the docks 
and converse with all the soldiers. Take note of the dog here, too.
Squall discovers that the Captain has just left after fishing from here.
You'll also find a Tabloid Guy hidden in the lower-right corner at the
docks. You can buy information from him, but it'll lower your SeeD rank.

Head back to Zell's house (you can rest up and save here). The Captain 
has just used the kitchen, and upon exiting make your way to the train
station. Talk to everyone there.

Proceed to the docks. The dog there will lead Squall to the Captain,
who's currently at the train station. Meet up with Raijin, and pursue
him back to the Hotel.

<!> Tip:
You've to draw a G.F pretty soon; be sure to equip the 'Draw' command.

Alternatively, you can simply ask the Tabloid Guy hiding at the harbour
for a 'gold' clue; he'll bring you straight to the Captain. This brings
down your SeeD rank, though. Another method would be be hang around and
do nothing for about 15 minutes; by the time you re-visit the Hotel the
Captain should be back.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS: Raijin  HP: 9,200  Weak: Poison  Strong vs.: Thunder
              Draw List: Thunder, Thundara, Shell, Protect  AP: 10

Get rid of his 2 flunkies by summoning a G.F, then concentrate your 
attacks on him. Raijin has a high offensive capability, but that's 
easily countered by casting 'Protect' on yourselves or using a 'Blind' 
spell on him. You can mug 'Str Up' from him.

BOSS: Raijin  HP: 10,800  Weak: Poison  Strong vs.: Thunder
              Draw List: Thunder, Thundara, Shell, Protect  AP: 12 
BOSS: Fujin  HP: 8,100  Weak: Poison  Strong vs.: Wind
             Draw List: Aero, Cura, Life, Pandemona  AP: 10

Start off by drawing G.F. Pandemona from Fujin and casting 'Blind' 
on Raijin. Concentrate on removing Raijin first. Fujin boasts of a 
deadly skill, 'Sai' (Shatter), which reduces your HPs to 1, so be wary. 
Junction 'Bio' to Elemental Attack if you so wish. Also, both bosses 
offer 2 items which you can steal: a Str Up from Raijin and a Megalixir
from Fujin. You'll receive 'Combat King 002' after this fight.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

G.F Pandemona is one of the few G.Fs which offer Spd-J. Being able to
act multiple times before the enemy does is invaluable.

Both Raijin and Fujin re-assert their stand by saying they're doing 
this for Seifer. Upon leaving, Squall acknowledges that some things 
cannot be prevented; anyone could be your ally or enemy. Then again, 
what of this strange feeling right now...?

Side events: To get out of town during the siege, talk to the girl
in the house next to Zell's, followed by the Big Bad Rascal in Zell's
house twice. Return to the neighbouring house, converse with all the
people inside, then leave.

Talk to the guard near the Car Rental shop, but DON'T close the message
screen. Let the people outside finish their motions, and eventually the
Big Bad Rascal should teach you a method to get out (just talk to him
basically) when you exit back to the previous screen.

After resolving this sequence of events, try challenging the residents
here to Card Battle. Ma Dincht (Zell's mother) holds Zell's card, but
she'll only play it if Zell's in your party. The Hotel Owner outside
the Balamb Hotel holds Pandemona's card.

#######################################################################
3l. [Winter Island: Shumi Tribe Village] <optional>

Draw Points: Ultima, Firaga, Blizzaga
G.Fs: Phoenix (Phoenix Pinion)
Magazines: Timber Maniacs (Inn OR Artisan's House)
#######################################################################

This is located on the northern-most continent of the world... it 
should be highlighted on your map if you spoke to the owner of the 
Repair Shop at F.H. Enter the spider-like structure.

3 Shumis will be guarding a Draw Point, and you'll have to cough up 
5,000 gil just to use it. I think it's worthwhile though -- you'll 
get Ultima, possibly the best spell in the game. Be sure to return 
here every now and then to stock up on this one. Proceed further on 
to the elevator when you're done.

The 1st structure you come across in the village should be the Inn. 
This one holds an issue of 'Timber Maniacs' plus a save point. However,
this copy seems to alternate locations; try looking in the Artisan's
House (4th building from right) if you can't seem to find it.

The 2nd building is out-of-bounds, and the 3rd houses the Elder. You
won't be seeing him now though.

Instead, head to the left-most Workshop, where a statue of Laguna is
being constructed. The Shumi there asks of Squall to pay a visit to 
the Elder, so do as he says, and return back here (the Workshop) after 
your 1st meeting with the village head. The sculptor here requires a
few materials to complete the statue (5 special stones to be exact),
and Squall has to play treasure-hunter.

After finding a stone, you'll have to return it to the Workshop before
locating the next one:

Blue Stone: Among the granite-looking rocks behind the Laguna statue, 
            to the left.
Wind Stone: Among the boulders to the left of the Inn.
Life Stone: Beneath a huge tree right of the Elder's house. You'll need 
            to do a bit of climbing to reach the rock among the roots.
Shadow Stone: Take the elevator up, and explore the circular stone ring 
              directly opposite to the 'Ultima' draw point. You should 
              find it in the top right corner.
Water Stone: In the sink of a resident's house, the one closest to the 
             Shumi Workshop. It's in the sink next to Artisan.
             You can also find a Water Stone at the pond near the above
             -mentioned resident's house, but it's a fake one.

Give these 5 stones to the sculptor and the Elder will present a 
'Phoenix Pinion' to Squall. This summons the G.F. Phoenix once when 
used in battle, which revives any fallen comrades as well as giving 
moderate fire-typed damage to all opponents. G.F Phoenix will
continue to appear randomly in battle for the rest of the game.

#######################################################################
3m. [Centra Ruins Region] (note: The southern islands on the map)
                                 <optional>

Enemies: Armadodo, Bomb, Buel, Blobra, Forbidden, Red Bat, Tonberry
Draw Points: Drain, Aero, Pain
G.Fs: Odin
Rare Cards: Odin
#######################################################################

On the upper half of the Centra region, if you ignore the island with 
the 3 narrow cliffs sticking out into the open sea, the rest of the 
islands to the east should form a ring around a patch of water. 

Look for a yellowish-brown diamond shaped structure on the 
south-eastern island of that ring, around the Centra Crater region.
It might take a while to find the ruins; use your map.

You have exactly 20 minutes to seek out Odin and defeat him here, so 
I'll advise you come prepared with Diablos' 'Encounter None' party 
ability. Try to have a few Aura stones (or spells) at hand, or simply 
have Squall at critical status with the ability to perform his 
'Renzokuken' before coming here. A high offensive rating for him 
wouldn't hurt as well. You'll have to rush here, so I'll adapt a 
point format:

1.  Starting place. Head into the background.
2.  Stairs ahead. Ascend using them.
3.  Circular statue. Go clockwise around it, climb the stairs behind.
    Take the right path after ascending the previous steps.
4.  Go all the way into the door in the background.
5.  Ascend the steps to get to the platform, which acts as a lift.
6.  Take the left ladder to the top, and enter the opening. Activate 
    the switch.
7.  Climb down again, examine the bluish altar, and take the opened
    right path (not ladder!) this time.
8.  Follow the spiraling steps until you reach a circular platform.
    There's a short ladder nearby -- climb it, head to the right and 
    pluck out the red jewel from the eye of the statue.
9.  Descend back, follow path leading upwards to the right.
10. Climb onto the green dome to reach another statue. Put the jewel 
    in to obtain a random 5 number password. Memorize it, or write it
    down on paper. Next, take out both red jewels.
11. Return to previous statue in point 8. Put both jewels in and enter 
    the password you received in point 10.
12. A door should open below. Enter to face Odin.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS G.F: Odin  HP: 18,400  Draw List: Stop, Death, Double, Triple
                AP: 20

Just have Squall unleash his limit break and you'll take him down 
easily. Besides, he won't attack you until the timer finishes. You 
might want to stock up on a few 'Triple' spells here if you've got 
time to spare, and make sure to mug 'Luck-J Scroll' from him.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unlike your regular G.Fs such as Ifrit or Carbuncle, Odin cannot be
junctioned; rather, he appears at random at the start of a normal enemy
encounter. When he does, he'll instantly dispatch every single opponent
with a success rate of 100%. Very convenient. Don't expect him to come
help during boss battles, though.

Side events: Try to engage a few Tonberries in combat here! They're 
always found around the circular statue mentioned in point 3 above. 
Save before you do so, and use Squall's Renzokuken to defeat them 
quickly. You should get Chef's Knives from them. Quistis' 'Micro 
Missile' works well on them too.

I'll cover the usage of Chef's Knives later on in Disc Three, when 
you have to return here to pick up another G.F.

########################################################################
3n. [Kashkabald Desert] <optional>

Enemies: Abyss Worm, Cactuar, Chimera
Blue Magic: Aqua Breath
Weapons: Twin Lance (Squall)
########################################################################

You should find a huge patch of land known as the Kashkabald Desert to 
the east of the Centra Ruins. Cactuars appear here, and each 1 when 
downed nets you 20 A.P. You'll need a high Speed and Hit% rating 
before you try to defeat them, but they're worth it. Remember to 
return here occasionally to build up your G.Fs' abilities! Cactuars
are known as Sabotenders in the Japanese version of ff 8.

Incidentally, the 'Cactus Thorns' you receive from them can be refined
under Ifrit's 'Refine Ammo' menu ability, to produce 40 Demolition
Ammo for Irvine's desperation.

You might encounter an UFO here; this side event will be detailed
later on in Disc Three.

Chimeras rarely appear in the desert too. They occasionally drop Water
Crystals, which lets Quistis learn her 'Aqua Breath' Blue Magic, or
you can mug 'Red Fangs' from them. Combine 2 Red Fangs with a Dino
Bone (T-Rexaur at Balamb Garden's Training Center) and 12 Screws for
Squall's 'Twin Lance' if you so wish.

Fastitocalon-Fs on the shores rarely drop Water Crystals, too. If
you're lucky enough to encounter the adult version called Fastitocalon
(you'll know it when you see it), mug them for Water Crystals.

#######################################################################
3o. [Trabia Garden] (note: Check your map; it's towards the north)

Draw Points: Thundaga, Zombie, Aura
Magazines: Timber Maniacs, Weapons Monthly August
Rare Cards: Selphie (Selphie's friend)
#######################################################################

Just follow Selphie, and when she meets up with her ex-classmate at the
gargoyle statue, Squall is asked if he's been looking after Selphie:
- (Not really.)
- (Just play along with it.)
It doesn't really matter which option you select.

Her ex-classmate holds Selphie's card, by the way. The 'Random' rule
enforced here might make things difficult, though.

Squall leaves Selphie alone for now; you can meet up with the rest at 
the basketball court. Do so by taking a left from the statue, another 
left at the makeshift dorms, then following the one-way path. Or you 
could stray off and explore the other areas of Trabia Garden, 
converse with the survivors and get information. I suggest you do 
the latter first.

In the flashback scene at the basketball court, you'll be controlling 
Squall at one time. Proceed upwards to head for the beach. In another 
scene, talk to all the children before heading through the door on
the right.

*spoiler ahead... skip this paragraph if you wish*
The party questions the necessity for bloodshed... but they know that 
conflict is inevitable. Irvine recalls his childhood, spent at an 
orphanage. This triggers off more memories for the other members, which 
reveals a startling fact long forgotten -- Edea was their matron at the 
orphanage. 

Side events: The cemetery at Trabia Garden hides an issue of Timber 
Maniacs. Apart from that, there's also the August issue of Weapons 
Monthly.

You'll have to talk to a student to the right of the dorms, who'll hint 
at the existence of a hidden treasure... starting from the gargoyle 
statue, take exactly 5 steps south and search the ground. You should get 
your copy. If you have trouble finding it, simply tap 'X' (U.S) 
or 'Circle' (Japanese) repeatedly around the area south of the statue...
the game isn't too particular about where you examine.

########################################################################
3p. [Trabia Region] <optional>

Enemies: Bite Bug, Gayla, Mesmerize, Snow Lion
         Blue Dragon (Forest, appears rarely)
Blue Magic: Acid
########################################################################

The new enemies around the Trabia region you'll encounter include 
Mesmerizes (pink horses with a blade on their heads) and Gaylas (black 
striped flying creatures). The former offers Mesmerize Blades up for 
grabs, the latter the spell 'Meltdown' at levels 30 and above. Also,
the Gaylas drop Mystery Fluids -- these allow Quistis to learn 'Acid'.

<!> Tip:
Meltdown spells are extremely useful in the sense that they cause an
opponent's Vitality (defense) rating to drop to zero. They're also
excellent when junctioned to Vitality.

Mesmerize Blades can be refined under Carbuncle's 'Recovery Medicine
Refinement' menu ability to produce Mega Potions. These heal everyone
in your party for 1,000 HP.

If you manage to come across a Blue Dragon, mug it for Fury Fragments,
or defeat it to make it drop Dragon Fangs. They're really rare though.
Btw, you can kill them easily with a 'Death' spell. Forget about the
Snow Lions; they aren't worth the time you spend killing them.

You might come across an UFO while fighting in the Trabia Heath
Peninsula region; I'll detail this side quest later on in Disc Three.

Just around the Trabia region will be a couple of dome-shaped Chocobo
forests. You can choose to visit them now, but I'll only detail this
side-quest in Disc Three.

#######################################################################
3q. [Shumi Tribe Village Revisited] (note: It's located to the north
                                           if you dont't remember)
                                           <optional>
#######################################################################

A visit to the Workshop here reveals that more manpower is required to 
complete the statue. Converse with the Elder, then speak to the Moomba
outside his house. Follow the fur-ball to the Workshop.

After the short sequence, visit the Elder again, then retrace your
steps back to the Workshop. Talk to the Elder's Attendant inside. Next,
head for the house beside the Workshop and converse with the Artisan
by the sink, before finally making a trip to the Elder once more; it
appears that Artisan will need a little bit of coaxing to lend a hand.

[Fishermans Horizon]
A quick trip to the Repair Shop near the train station here yields a
small scene with the owner, and Squall receives a Moomba Doll.

[Shumi Tribe Village]
Talk to the Elder, then the Artisan in his house. He should agree to
help now. Converse with the village head one more time before leaving
to receive a Status Guard item. 

#######################################################################
3r. [Miscellaneous Updates Part One] <optional>

Blue Magic: Aqua Breath, Degenerator
Rare Cards: Pandemona, Siren, Quezacotl, MiniMog, Zell, Quistis, Rinoa 
Weapons: Punishment, Twin Lance (Squall)
         Gauntlet (Zell), Bismarck (Irvine), Red Scorpion (Quistis),
         Cardinal (Rinoa)
#######################################################################

The next dungeon is quite combat intensive; I'll provide you with a 
weapon upgrades check-list here, plus any other items you may want to 
get in preparation for future battles ahead.

{Weapons}

Squall: His 'Punishment' should be obtainable now. You'll need a Chef's
Knife (defeat a Tonberry at the Centra Ruins), 2 Star Fragments (get 4
Iron Giant - blue armoured monsters with a huge blade - lv. 5 cards), a
Turtle Shell (steal from Armadodos in the Tomb of the Unknown King) and
8 Screws (Geezards in the Timber or Galbadia regions).

Btw, T-Rexaurs in Balamb Garden's Training Center rarely drop Star
Fragments, too.

Alternatively, his weaker 'Twin Lance' requires 1 Dino Bone (T-Rexaur in
Balamb Garden's Training Center), 2 Red Fangs (mug Chimeras in Kashkabald
Desert, Centra region) and 12 Screws. 

Zell: His 'Gauntlet' requires a Dragon Skin (defeat - not steal from - 
level 30 and above Anacondaurs in Roshfall Forest, north of Timber) and
a Fury Fragment (use 'Card Mod.' ability to modify 4 Blue Dragon - 
bluish-green scaly dragons with a yellowish underside - lv. 4 cards).
Blue Dragons are also found in Trabia's forests, albeit rarely. Mug
them for Fury Fragments.

Irvine: A 'Bismarck' requires a Steel Pipe (steal from Wendigos in the 
Galbadian deserts and Roshfall Forest or modify a lv. 5 Elastoid's 
card), 4 Dynamo Stones (modify 4 Blitz lv. 4 cards - metal warriors 
armed with a hammer or defeat level 30 and above Creeps in the sewers
of Deling City to make them drop the items) and 8 Screws. You can
wait until later in Disc Three for an easier time locating Dynamo
Stones, though.

Quistis: 2 Ochu Tentacles (gigantic green and pink plants in Roshfall 
Forest - low encounter rate) and 2 Dragon Skins for her Red Scorpion.

Rinoa: She needs a Cockatrice Pinion (steal from high level Cockatrices 
in the forests of Timber), a Mesmerize Blade (Mesmerizes in Trabia 
region) and a Sharp Spike (scorpion-like monster Grand Mantis, lurking
in the stairway leading to the sewers in General Caraway's Estate in 
Galbadia) for her Cardinal.

Selphie: You can't really get her Crescent Wish now, but you'll do 
yourself a favour by stealing a Life Ring from Lefty that roams the
Winhill area, and 4 Sharp Spikes from the Grand Mantis first.

{Blue Magic}

Quistis' Blue Magicks: You can learn her 'Aqua Breath' by defeating 
high level Fastitocalon-Fs (orange fish-like creatures on the shores of 
Balamb, rarely drop Water Crystals) or Chimeras in the Kashkabald Desert
(low encounter rate) to receive Water Crystals. 

If you haven't already done so, modify Gesper (gigantic blue-headed 
monsters) lv. 1 cards to receive Quistis' Degenerator. This blue magic
takes out a single enemy instantly with a pretty high success rate.

If you're having trouble finding the cards either for remodeling your
weapons or receiving Blue Magic items, try playing Nida, who's at
the control helms of Balamb Garden. He carries decent middle to high 
level normal cards. Another person would be the bartender at Aphrora
pub in Timber.

{Rare Cards}

Rare Cards: These are totally optional, and some are reminders.
- Get G.F. card 'Pandemona' from a man standing outside Balamb Hotel.
  He appears at random.
- Get Quistis' card from any of the Trepe Groupies at Balamb Garden,
  i.e. the girls at the 2F Classroom.
- Win Zell's card from his mother at Balamb City. Zell must be in your
  party first.
- Lose G.F. Ifrit's card to General Caraway at Deling. He'll play 
  Rinoa's card in the next round. You can get back Ifrit's card from 
  Martine, who's sitting outside the Mayor's house in Fishermans
  Horizon. To make sure you lose Ifrit's card to Caraway, play 4 weak
  cards along with Ifrit's; when you lose, Caraway should take Ifrit's
  card.
- Mayor Dobe at F.H has G.F. 'Quezacotl' card.
- A kid circling the 1F of Balamb Garden has a 'MiniMog' card.
- The Master on the 2F Dollet Pub has G.F. 'Siren' card.

#######################################################################
[Centra Region -- Cape of Good Hope] (note: It's down south)
#######################################################################

Pilot Balamb Garden towards the Orphanage (use your map) to trigger 
off a confrontation with Edea's Garden, which is hovering nearby.

#######################################################################
3s. [Invasion -- Balamb Garden]

Enemies: G-Soldier, Elite Soldier, Paratrooper, GIM52A
Blue Magic: Micro Missile
#######################################################################

You'll have to swap your G.Fs around quite a few times here, or simply
use Diablos' 'Encounter None' party ability to save yourself the
trouble. Be sure to save beforehand.

Squall is informed of Galbadia Garden's presence in the vicinity. You 
have to give a set of orders to the students, before Squall is ordered 
downstairs. Here're the available commands:
- (No orders/End.)
- (My feelings on this.)
- (The Garden's course.)
- (Prepare for the attack.)
- (Prepare our defense.)
- (Call my comrades.)
- (What to do with the hot dogs.)
- (Take care of the junior classmen.)
Give out your commands in this order: 'The Garden's course', 'Prepare
for the attack', 'Prepare our defense', 'Call my comrades', 'Take care
of the junior classmen' and 'No orders/End'. Add a few more if you
like... Nida won't like it, though ^_^

Meet up with your companions, and after directing everyone to their
positions on the 2nd Floor, head for the Quad. Zell'll be assembling
the troops. Return to the 3rd floor, where both Gardens will mount a 
massive attack on each other.

You'll be controlling Zell's party now. Head back to the western wing 
of the Quad, where a collision will throw Rinoa off the platform. Leave
her for now, and make your way to the Front Gate to meet up with Squall.

If you haven't already done so, the GIM52As in the vicinity carry 
Missiles, which allow Quistis to learn her 'Micro Missile'.

You'll have to form a party of 3:
- Selphie, Quistis
- Quistis, Irvine
- Irvine, Selphie
Squall is a compulsory character here, whereas Zell is assigned to 
rescue Rinoa. When you're done, head back to the Garden and take a 
left to reach a save point. Junction your members before moving to the 
2F classrooms via the elevator. You'll have to combat 4 green 
Galbadian paratroopers here. 

They're pretty quick (and nasty) on the offensive, and have 'Demi' 
magic available for casting. You should be able to take them out with 
a G.F or 'Death' spells, but if you get low on health, using your
limit breaks is a good idea. Talk to everyone in the classroom before
leaving.

Nida requires Squall's presence on the 3rd floor bridge. Squall
predicts that Balamb Garden will not be able to hold off the enemy for
long; he decides to carry out a last-ditch attack on Edea's army.
Proceed to the 2nd floor when you're done.

Squall is asked to look for a missing child -- you can find him towards 
the end of the corridor on the 2F, but in the resulting melee Squall 
gets knocked down by a trooper. He'll pin Squall against the wall. Hit 
'X' (U.S) or 'Circle' (Japanese) to reveal 3 choices, and take the 3rd
one for Squall to notice the emergency hatchet. Press the same button
again, then select the 2nd option to unlock the door. You'll get
involved in a mini-game.

Controls:

<U.S version>

X: Punch
Triangle: Kick
Square: Block
Circle: Deathblow (appears later)

<Japanese version>

Circle: Punch
X: Kick
Square: Block
Triangle: Deathblow (appears later)

Squall'll start off at a disadvantage with lesser health (check the red 
bar at the lower-left corner for his HP), and the 1st time you 
experience this mini-game it'll prove to be a little tricky to win. 
Basically, there're 2 methods to get past this.

Method 1: Mash away at the 'Punch' button straight from the start. If 
you're fast enough, Squall should cut off every single attempt to 
retaliate from the trooper. If the opponent starts to block repeatedly, 
kick him.

Method 2: Hold 'Block' until the 'Deathblow' command appears. Press 
the specified button to knock off two-thirds of the trooper's health,
and finish him off with a flurry of punches and kicks. You can choose
to reverse the order here (meaning, smack him with a few punches,
then hold 'Block' until 'Deathblow' appears).

3t. [Invasion -- Galbadia Garden]

Enemies: G-Soldier, Elite Soldier, Creeps, Jelleye, Death Claw,
         Blitz, Tri-Face
         Slapper (Ice hockey rink)
Draw Points: Aura, Protect, Life, Shell, Haste
G.Fs: Cerberus, Alexander (Edea)
Rare Cards: Cerberus
#######################################################################

Once Rinoa is rescued, you should begin by heading left. Both Squall 
and Rinoa share a moment outside the Garden's compound, and the latter 
thanks Squall for saving her life, with a slight hint of her feelings 
towards her savior ^_^ Name your ring (Griever), then select the 2nd 
option to enter Galbadia Garden together with Rinoa. Take note of
the hidden Aura draw point in the background; use Siren's 'Move-Find'
party ability to locate it.

Inside, save and re-organize your party (junction everyone accordingly).
Take a right, then another right in the next screen to reach the stairs.

Going upstairs, you'll come across Raijin and Fujin, who'll choose to 
leave Seifer in the hands of Squall. Go left from there and enter a 
door on the right to get your 1st Card Key (talk to the male student).

Side events: The Death Claws (furry monsters carrying 4 blades) have
a useful spell at levels 30 and above -- Reflect. This works well
junctioned to the Spirit parameter. The Slappers here (demi-human
ice hockey players) are probably the best sources of EXP you've
encountered so far.

Return to the save point, then take a left, and enter the left door. 
Run across the ice hockey rink and exit through the door on the right 
(the left door holds a 'Life' draw point, btw). The next area has an 
entrance opposite to where Squall is. Enter and converse with the 
student inside to get your Lv. 2 Card Key. Retrace your steps back to 
the save point.

Proceed right to the stairs (where you met Raijin and Fujin), and 
climb it to the rooftop (3F). Leap down onto the tennis court, and head 
left. The next region should be familiar to you -- just keeping moving 
down (ignore the stairs on your way) until you reach the Main Hall of 
Galbadia Garden. A G.F. boss will be waiting for you in the center.
There's a save point to the east side of the Hall, btw.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS G.F: Cerberus  HP: 10,000  Strong vs.: Wind, Thunder
                    Draw List: Quake, Double, Triple  AP: 30

This puppy likes to cast 'Triple' on itself (undo this by using 
'Dispell' on it), 'Tornado' and 'Quake' on your members (junction Quake
to Elemental Defense or cast Float).

Beat it around with a few 'Demi' spells and anything else non-wind nor
thunder elemental related. Draw a few 'Triple' spells from it if you
can; they act as pretty good spells for junctioning to any parameter.
Cerberus carries a 'Spd-J Scroll'; be sure to mug it.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cerberus boasts of the Spd-J ability, in addition to its ST-Atk-J,
ST-Def-J and Auto Haste.

Once you've received Cerberus as a G.F, make your way to the south-west 
exit. Take a left in the next screen and converse with a female student 
to get a Lv. 3 Card Key. Retrace your steps back to the stairs you 
passed earlier on, and ascend from there to the 2nd Floor. Move left 
from there to reach an elevator. Use it to get to a save point... and 
your awaiting adversaries.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS: Seifer  HP: 10,000  Weak: Poison  
              Draw List: Fira, Thundara, Dispell, Haste  AP: 20

He's a bit tougher this time around. You'll want to counter his high 
attack power by casting 'Protect' on your allies (Seifer seems to 
concentrate all his attacks on Squall, btw), but generally, his magical 
prowess can be ignored.

Once Seifer gets down to half of his total HP he'll start using his
'Demon Slice', which deals out a pretty hefty sum of damage to a
single member. Keep two (or one) allies as healers, and attack Seifer
using Squall, or whoever has the highest offensive rating. I generally
take Squall since his Gunblade offers critical hits.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Return to the 2F, then head right from the stairs. Proceed anti
-clockwise to find an invisible save point (use Siren's 'Move-Find'
party ability to see it) a bit further down. Enter the Auditorium to
your right.

<!> Tip:
The upcoming battle sees another drawable G.F up for grabs; make sure
someone's carrying the 'Draw' command.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS: Seifer  HP: 7,400  Weak: Poison
              Draw List: Fira, Thundara, Dispell, Haste

He's weakened in this confrontation, but take time to steal from him 
before finishing him off. You'll have to fight him and Edea 
consecutively, so don't dawdle too much.

BOSS: Edea  HP: 15,000  Draw List: Blizzara, Demi, Esuna, Alexander
            Total AP: 50

Draw G.F. Alexander from her before anything else, and follow up with 
Shell on your members. Edea's capable of a few pretty nasty spells, and
has 'Death' at her disposal. Attack her with Diablos, and be sure to
leave a character on standby to revive those hit by Edea's 'Death' spell.
Defeat her quickly, or you'll run yourselves into trouble.

Edea's 'Maelstrom' is a gravity-based attack which takes off half of
each member's current HP, in addition to causing status ailments.

Also, take note that summoning G.F. Carbuncle doesn't work anymore; 
Edea will simply endow herself with a 'Reflect' status as well and 
bounce spells off herself. Break that with 'Dispell'.

Cheap Alternative: You should have picked up a few 'Meltdown' spells 
from the Gaylas in the Trabia region, and 'Aura' spells from a draw 
point in Trabia Garden. Cast Meltdown on Edea and Aura on Squall -- one 
Renzokuken should be all that's needed to down the sorceress.

Press the 'Circle' (U.S) or 'Triangle' (Japanese) button repeatedly to
have Squall's limit break icon appear if he's in critical or Aura
condition, and has a full time bar.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

G.F. Alexander holds 'High Magic Refinement' menu ability; you can refine
5 middle class spells to a single upper class spell, i.e. five Cura
spells to one Curaga. Its 'Revive' command ability works like a
regular Phoenix Down, but without the added costs.

########################################################################
4a. [Balamb Garden: Infirmary]

Magazines: Weapons Monthly July (Training Center)
           Combat King 003 (Balamb Hotel)
########################################################################

Squall is contemplating his next move at the infirmary when Quistis 
asks of him to head to the 3F Bridge. Oblige her, form your party of 3
(sans Rinoa) and pilot Balamb Garden south-west towards the Orphanage.
Check your map.

Side events: Pick up the July issue of Weapons Monthly from Balamb
Garden's Training Center. This one won't be so easy to spot; it appears
as a little brown package surrounded by a yellow band on the ground.

Another one involves Zell. If you've been a frequent visitor at the
Library with Zell, visit Balamb City; a random event might transpire
-- Zell has a guest, and she's waiting for him at the Hotel. Spend the 
night there, and you should receive a copy of 'Combat King 003' in the
morning.

Visits to the Library may *sometimes* throw up special events. For
instance, the first event has Zell enquiring about a book when he
meets a girl with a pig-tail, the 2nd has a 'Conceited SeeD' asking
about the same girl... etc. Eventually when you do make a trip to
Balamb City, you'll be able to get the magazine. And even if you do
not do this side quest, 'Combat King 003' can still be purchased at a
later time in the game.

#######################################################################
4b. [Edea's Orphanage]

Draw Points: Curaga
Magazines: Timber Maniacs
Rare Cards: Edea (Edea), Seifer (Cid)
Blue Magic: Fire Breath
Weapons: Bismarck (Irvine), Crescent Wish (Selphie)
#######################################################################

*spoiler here... skip this paragraph if you wish*
Edea apologises for all the trouble, and explains that she was under 
the control of Ultimecia, a witch from the future. Ultimecia requires 
Ellone's powers in order to achieve her ultimate goal of ruling the 
world in different time periods; Edea's body is but a tool for her. 
She warns of the danger of Ultimecia awaking Adel, the original witch, 
as well. Squall then asks about Rinoa's condition, but Edea says that 
it is beyond her powers to help.

Squall has no interest in continuing the conversation with Edea and Cid; 
he decides to return to Balamb Garden to inform the rest of the current 
situation.

Side events: The Orphanage has a copy of Timber Maniacs lying on the 
ground. You can also win Edea's and Seifer's card from Edea and Cid 
respectively.

The forests outside are also home to a variety of interesting 
creatures, which include Grand Mantis (steal Sharp Spikes), Blitz 
(they drop Betrayal Blades or Dynamo Stones) and Geezards (Screws).
Ruby Dragons can also be found, but they're extremely rare. If you're
lucky enough to meet one, mug it for Inferno Fangs.

Assuming you did get those Inferno Fangs, you can remodel Selphie's
weapon now: 1 Inferno Fang, 1 Life Ring (stealable from Lefty in the
Winhill region) and 4 Sharp Spikes. If you didn't, there's another
opportunity later on.

Inferno Fangs can also be used to enable Quistis to learn her 'Fire
Breath' Blue magic.

If you've had trouble acquiring Irvine's 'Bismarck' in Disc Two, you
can do it easily now; 1 Steel Pipe, 4 Dynamo Stones and 8 Screws.
Blitzs tend to drop Dynamo Stones at levels 30 and above.

[Balamb Garden]
Having reported to the rest, Squall returns to the infirmary.

#######################################################################
4c. [Laguna Dream Sequence Part Four: Trabia Canyon]

Enemies: Ochu, Mesmerize, Bite Bug, Gayla, Ruby Dragon
Blue Magic: Fire Breath
Weapons: Red Scorpion (Quistis)
#######################################################################

Whether Ward appears or not in this event is totally random. I think
it has something to do with how frequently you read copies of Timber
Maniacs, though.

Laguna, having exhausted almost all finances during his travels, has 
taken up a job as an actor. He plays a knight, and in this scene he 
has to protect a maiden in distress from a dragon, which is played by 
Kiros and Ward. However, the dragon seems rather authentic in this 
take...

Controls:

<U.S version>

Square: Defend!
Triangle: Attack!

<Japanese version>

Square: Defend!
X: Attack!

There're two methods to get past this mini-game: 

Method 1: Tap the 'Attack!' button once to have Laguna swing his blade,
then immediately assume a defensive stance to block the dragon's swipe.
After Laguna parries the blow, have him attack again. Just keep on
repeating this pattern of attacking and defending and Laguna should
emerge victorious.

Method 2: Mash away at the 'Attack!' button rapidly. Laguna should
keep slashing at the Ruby Dragon, and cut off any attempt to retaliate.
You may have to block occasionally, but it isn't much trouble if you've
got quick fingers.

When Laguna is re-united with his companions, take the 2nd option to 
retreat left to a save point. Junction your party and save before 
returning to confront the dragon.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENEMY: Ruby Dragon  HP: Variable  Weak: Ice, Holy  
                    Strong vs.: Fire, Wind
                    Draw List: Aero, Firaga, Demi  AP: 14

Just summon Shiva or Alexander, and have the remaining one character 
attack (have him junction 'Blizzaga' to Elemental Attack if you want)
or heal. This creature isn't too hard to take down. Remember to plunder
an 'Inferno Fang' from it! This item allows Quistis to learn her 'Fire
Breath' Blue Magic or acts as one of the raw materials for Selphie's 3rd
weapon, the Crescent Wish.
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

Side events: You can encounter Mesmerizes (steal their Mesmerize Blades) 
and Ochus (gigantic green plants with flailing tentacles -- get their 
Ochu tentacles) here if you haven't already encountered them. The 
Ochu has a tendency to rob you of your magic spells, so be careful. 

Ochus are found on the same screen as the Ruby Dragon... it's a pretty
small space, so make sure you don't go running into the Ruby Dragon
by accident, if you want some Ochu Tentacles first. Combine 2 Ochu
Tentacles with 2 Dragon Skins (dropped by high level Anacondaurs) for
Quistis' 'Red Scorpion'.

[Edea's Orphanage]
Laguna comes to the orphanage looking for Ellone, but resigns himself 
to the fact that she's been taken away by the Estharians.

#######################################################################
4d. [Transition -- Balamb Garden and Edea's Orphanage]
#######################################################################

Squall ponders the possibility of going back in time to rescue Rinoa 
when he wakes up... Edea might know something, so off you go.

[Edea's Orphanage]
Edea locates Ellone's ship, the 'White SeeD', and presents Squall with 
a letter introducing him and his intentions.

Try selling Edea's letter at a shop for 125 Gil, then returning to
Edea's Orphanage; Edea will simply hand you another letter, which you
can sell again. Kinda like an infinite Gil trick, but it's pretty
worthless if you ask me. Just thought you might like to know ^_^

#######################################################################
4e. [Finding the White SeeD: Centra Region]

Draw Points: Holy
Magazines: Timber Maniacs
Rare Cards: Shiva (Zone), Angelo (Watts)
#######################################################################

North of the orphanage will be a group of islands. If you ignore the 
one to the west (the continent with 3 cliffs sticking out into the 
open sea) you'll find that the remaining islands form a broken ring 
around a patch of water.

The 'White SeeD' is located somewhere near the south-western 
shoreline cliffs which encircle this patch of water. You need to do 
a bit of camera work to actually spot the ship, though.

[White SeeD]
Squall explains his intentions, but the crew refuses to grant him an
audience with the leader of the ship. Well, you don't really have to
leave, so just explore the White SeeD.

Along the way, you'll find Watts (remember him from Rinoa's 'Forest
Owls'?). He holds Angelo's card and some extra bits of information for
the inquisitive gamer.

If you follow Zone up to the ship's bridge, you can pick up Shiva's 
card by exchanging an adult magazine (Girl Next Door from Timber 
Maniacs building) with Zone after speaking to him a few times. Take
the 1st option to give it to him for free.

There's also a copy of Timber Maniacs to be found on the ship's bridge.
You should have collected all of them by this time. Here's a recap of
their locations:

1. At Balamb Hotel/Train Station   7. At the Repair Shop in F.H
2. At Timber Maniacs Building      8. At F.H Hotel 2F
3. At Timber Hotel 2F              9. At the Inn/Artisan's house in
4. At Hotel Dollet 2F                 the Shumi Tribe Village
5. At Dollet Pub                  10. At Trabia Garden's cemetery
6. At Galbadia Hotel 2F           11. At Edea's Orphanage
                                  12. On the White SeeD

They're viewable using the Study Panel at the 2F classroom of Balamb 
Garden, on the 'School Festival Committee' site.

The Leader awaiting in his cabin tells Squall that when they were caught
in a conflict between the Galbadian army and the Estharian troops,
Ellone took the liberty of leaving on an Esthar rescue boat. She's now
somewhere within the Esthar territory, which is only accessible via the
bridge at Fishermans Horizon.

Proceeding on into Esthar means you won't be able to visit the other 
places on the map for quite a while. I've outlined a few *optional* 
events below which you might want to tackle before moving the story 
any further.

#######################################################################
4f. [Centra Ruins Revisited] (note: It's to the north-east of Edea's
                                    Orphanage) <optional>

G.Fs: Tonberry
#######################################################################

This should be where you fought Odin. Take both Squall and Quistis 
along, and have them both at critical status with the ability to use 
their limit breaks. Head for the 3rd screen (the one with the Tonberry
statue in the center of a circular platform), where you'll have to 
combat Tonberries. 

Quistis should have a high Speed parameter -- have her unleash her 
'Micro Missile' Blue Magic on the Tonberry a few times before Squall 
(with a high Strength rating) steps in to finish off the Tonberry with 
his Renzokuken. Both of them should be in critical status for this
tactic to work smoothly.

You'll gain 0 EXP (and Chef's Knives) for your efforts, but after the 
20th Tonberry you kill, there's a chance of meeting a Tonberry King
when you defeat another one of those adorable green little creatures.

However, this guy seems to appear randomly, so you might have to rack 
up quite a few dead Tonberries before actually meeting him. You don't 
really have to take down 20 of them in one shot; there's always time 
to head outside to save before continuing. You can use Ifrit's 'Refine 
Ammo' menu ability to receive 20 Armour Piercing (AP) Ammo for
Irvine's limit break, from a single Chef's Knife.

<!> Tip:
Carding 20 Tonberries doesn't work; only killing them will summon the
Tonberry King.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS: Tonberry King  HP: 90,000+  Draw List: Death, Curaga, Full-life
                     AP: 20

Draw a few 'Full-life' spells, cast a Meltdown spell on him and unleash 
Squall's Renzokuken. He should be dead by then. Just watch out for 
his magics.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

You'll get your Tonberry G.F. -- you should learn its 'Familiar' 
menu ability on top of everything else. Its 'Level Up' and 'Level Down' 
command abilities are also useful for tweaking the enemies' levels -- 
some of them drop different items at different levels, remember? Keep 
this in mind the next time you want to collect raw materials for your 
weapon remodeling events.

And if in future battles, should you find your opponents too difficult 
for you, just use 'Level Down' on them to halve their levels. Take 
note that this doesn't work on bosses.

#######################################################################
4g. [Chocobo Forests] <optional>

G.Fs: Boko the Chocobo (Gysahl Greens)
Rare Cards: Chicobo
#######################################################################

Chocobo Forests are dome-shaped forests you'll find on the Trabia and 
Centra continents. Another one is located among the forests in the 
north-eastern cliffs on the Overworld -- you'll have to ride a chocobo 
from the Trabia region, and across the shallow waters to get to this 
one (the Chocobo Sanctuary) in Grandidi Forest. It's pretty well
camouflaged.

Side events: The forests in which the Chocobo Sanctuary is hidden in
houses 2 powerful enemies: the Malboro and the Hexadragon. You don't
need to trouble yourselves with them now, so run when you see them.
Fortunately, they appear rarely. If you're feeling daring, mug some
Red Fangs from the Hexadragon and Malboro Tentacles from the Malboro.

You'll need to get a 'ChocoSonar' and 'ChocoZiner' from the kid within
a Chocobo Forest. Next, hit the 'Square' button to get a menu:

1. To detect: [ChocoSonar].
2. To catch: [ChocoZiner].
3. Help me.
4. No way, I'm not doing this.

Equip the ChocoSonar. At specified spots, the ChocoSonar will respond
(watch the red bar) when you tap the 'X' button.

Equip the ChocoZiner, and blow it for a small chocobo to fall down.
Blow again for it to return. You'll have to do this until there's 
only a single small chocobo on the screen (there may be multiple
chicobos in each forest). Talk to it to get a big Chocobo to appear. 

If you happen to activate the ChocoZiner where the sonar shows no
response, you'll get your equipment snitched by a chicobo. Buy it
back from the Chocoboy for 700 gil.
 
Alternatively, you can ask the kid to summon a big Chocobo for you for
1,200 gil. Also, note that everytime you get the big Chocobo to appear
by *yourself*, you'll receive a 'Pledge of Affection' (usually just a
bunch of stones hidden in the ground which you'll have to find using
the 'ChocoZiner').

Collect all 6 of them (one from each forest) and present these to the
chocobos in the Chocobo Sanctuary (the one located in the north
-eastern cliffs mentioned above) for a 'Chicobo' card.

Below are the locations of the 6 chocobo forests:

1. West of Trabia Garden
2. North-east of Trabia Garden (here's where you should ride a chocobo 
   to get to the Chocobo Sanctuary)
3. North-west of the Shumi Tribe Village
4. North-east of the Centra Ruins
5. East of Edea's Orphanage
6. South of Kashkabald Desert

I'll give a general example of how the whole procedure works. Let's
take the Chocobo Forest north-west of the Shumi Tribe Village:

1. Purchase equipment from Chocoboy. You need to do this only once.
2. Press 'Square' to open up the menu and equip 'ChocoSonar'.
3. There're a total of 4 spots where the 'ChocoSonar' goes crazy (press
   'X' to use it) for this particular forest.
4. The spot you're looking for is the one nearest to the Chocokid,
   a few steps north-east from him.
5. Switch over to the 'ChocoZiner', and blow it at the exact spot using
   the 'X' button.
6. A single chicobo should fall down. Talk to it, and the big Chocobo
   should appear.
7. The hidden stones in this forest are somewhere in the upper-right
   regions of the screen. Keep using the 'ChocoZiner' in this area.
8. The Chocobo should dig up the stones for you, and you're done.
9. Of course, it isn't as easy for the other Chocobo forests. The
   Chocoboy will provide a small hint for a price, though.

And here's another example, this time from the Chocobo Forest north
-east of the Centra Ruins. I've had a lot of e-mails on this:

1. You'll need to be very careful in this area, because there's only
   one spot in the entire forest where the 'ChocoSonar' reacts.
2. And this spot is extremely small, hence much harder to find.
3. Starting from the left of the Chocoboy (or the Chocoboy's right
   side), keep walking north.
4. Repeatedly use the 'ChocoSonar' for every single small step Squall
   takes. You'll eventually find the spot.
5. Blow the 'ChocoZiner' to get the Chicobo. Talk to it to get the
   Chocobo to appear.
6. The Chocoboy's standing over the spot where the stones are hidden.
   Challenge him to Card Battle using 'Square', but instead of playing
   a game, tell him to move (3rd option).
7. Search the spot using the 'ChocoZiner' for the hidden stones, and
   you're done.

If you don't feel like doing this event now, you can leave it until
you've acquired the air-ship Ragnarok, which will be later on in the
game. I'll remind you.

Some people have written in requesting for full guides to each forest;
well, half the fun is figuring out the puzzles and trying to decipher
the Chocoboy's cryptic clues, so... I'm afraid I won't be providing
them anytime soon. Still, you can refer to Part II of Scott Ong's
'Final Fantasy VIII FAQ' at www.gamefaqs.com for help.

<Riding a Chocobo>
D-pad/Left Analog Stick: Gets the chocobo moving. Btw, all chocobos
                         have the ability to cross shallow waters.
                         Such areas are identified as having a lighter
                         shade of blue compared to the deeper dark
                         -blue regions of the oceans
Start: Brings up the bar that toggles the rumble feature on/off and
       pauses the game
Select: Toggles the World Sphere/Map on/off
X (U.S): Dismount from the Chocobo. When you do that, the chocobo will
         scoot off on its own; you'll need to re-capture it again at
         a Chocobo Forest if you want to ride one later, assuming
         you have yet to solve the puzzle there. 
         In the Japanese version of ff 8, press 'Circle' to dismount.

These adorable creatures are pretty fast on their feet. Also, you can't
encounter enemies while riding on a chocobo. Incidentally, the Gysahl
Greens you can purchase from the chocoboy allow you to summon Boko
in battle. They're kinda useless though, seeing how their 'Choco Fire'
damages a single opponent for only a measly 500+.

The chocobo can power up its attacks in battle, but you'll need a 
Pocket Station peripheral, which is sold separately. Unfortunately,
I don't own the latter ^_^

After Squall emerges victorious in about 15 to 20 Card Battles in
Balamb Garden, the Card Club Quest becomes available. By this I mean
you can do Card Battle with the various members of the CC Group in
Balamb Garden. Here're their locations, and the order in which you
should challenge them:

(note: Some of them appear randomly. If they're not where I said they
       should be, try leaving and re-entering the same area again.)

Jack: He can be spotted wandering around the Garden Directory Board on 
      the 1F.
Club: He wanders the northern regions of the 1F.
Diamond: 2 girls will be walking up to the Garden Directory Board on
         the 1F; challenge them only when they both stop to chat at
         the Directory Board.
Spade: A man near the lift on the 2F. He doesn't appear too often.
Heart: Xu on the 3F Command Center.
King: Speak with Nida after defeating Xu, then converse with Dr.
      Kadowaki at the infirmary using 'Square'. Head for Squall's
      cabin, and ask your companions to leave you alone.
      Choose to rest, and during the night, King will appear randomly.
      If you fail to win, you can have a re-match on the 3F Bridge.
Joker: In the Training Center (appears at random). He'll also sell you 
       items. Plus, if you manage to beat him, he'll upgrade your 
       'Battle Report' to include a 'G.F Report'. This guy appears
       randomly near the 'Blizzard' draw point after you defeat Jack.

The CC Group members hold excellent (and rare) cards among themselves. 
Below are the 3 G.F. cards you should be able to pick up from them:

Heart: Carbuncle
King: Gilgamesh
Joker: Leviathan

If you haven't done so already, the kid in blue circling the 1st Floor
of Balamb Garden holds the MiniMog card.

########################################################################
4i. [Miscellaneous Updates Part Two] <optional>

Weapons: Punishment (Squall), Gauntlet (Zell), Red Scorpion (Quistis) 
########################################################################

{Preparations}

Have Alexander learn its 'Medicine Data' character ability, followed by
'Medicine Level Up' menu ability. It helps if you're combating Cactuars
at the Kashkabald Desert, to the east of the Centra Ruins. One more
thing: learn Pandemona's 'Initiative' (Saigeke) character ability, which
allows a character to always start a battle with a full time bar.

Before you go into Esthar, you'll want to have the following -- 6 Steel
Pipes (refine the lv. 5 Elastoid's card or steal from Wendigos - use
Tonberry's 'Level Down' ability on them if their levels are too high 
- in Roshfall Forest) and 60 Remedies. Use G.F. Alexander's 'Medicine 
Level Up' Menu Ability to refine these 60 Remedies into 6 Remedy Pluses. 
The above items are essential for acquiring a G.F. later on. 

<!> Tip:
Roshfall Forest is north of Timber. Use the menu screen's location
displayer feature (the window to the lower left in the main menu) to
confirm that you're in the right place.

You might also want to learn Tonberry's 'Call Shop' Menu Ability. It'll 
come in handy on your future journeys.

{Weapons}

Weapon remodeling is optional here though, so you can pretty ignore
the following section (which basically serves as a reminder):

Squall: His 'Punishment' requires a Chef's Knife, 2 Star Fragments,
        1 Turtle Shell and 8 Screws.
        You can either modify 3 Iron Giant lv. 5 cards to 1 Star
        Fragment, or combat T-Rexaurs at Balamb Garden's Training
        Center, and hope they drop Star Fragments when defeated.
Zell/Quistis: Acquiring Dragon Skins should prove easier now; use
              Tonberry's 'Level Up' command on Anacondaurs in Roshfall
              Forest, then defeat them to make them drop the items.
              The Gauntlet requires 1 Dragon Skin and 1 Fury Fragment;
              Quistis' Red Scorpion requires 2 Ochu Tentacles and 2
              Dragon Skins.

Like I said, weapon remodeling at this point in the game is not
essential. I'll guide you towards obtaining each character's ultimate
weapon later on in the walkthrough. 

#######################################################################
4j. [Fishermans Horizon Bridge]
#######################################################################

Pilot Balamb Garden over to F.H and the scene will switch to Squall. 
Pick up Rinoa from the infirmary.

[Horizon Bridge]
You'll meet up with the rest of your party at the end of the bridge. 
Quistis teases Squall about Rinoa, before Edea tells Squall to meet 
up with Professor Odine in Esthar. Zell remarks that Squall should 
have a rough idea of who he is:
- Yeah, I remember.
- I can't remember... tell me more. *
- Whatever.
Head off into the background.

########################################################################
4k. [Esthar Region]

Enemies: Mesmerize, Malboro
########################################################################

Edea will be playable, and starts off at lv. 26. Don't bother to raise 
her levels as she'll only be with you temporarily. Edea has a rather 
good affiliation with your G.Fs however, so make her your primary 
summoner if you wish. Head towards the lake (remember to junction 
Edea if you're gonna use her; she has zero spells available when she 
joins you).

I didn't detail Edea's limit break in the 'Cast' section in case I
ruin the plot for some of you... here it is:

Limit Break: Ice Strike
Edea conjures up a gigantic ice javelin, and hurls it towards her
opponents. It's similar to the spell she used on Squall towards the end
of Disc One, during the Galbadian Parade.

########################################################################
4l. [Great Salt Lake]

Enemies: Vysage, Lefty, Righty
Draw Points: Meteor, Thundaga
########################################################################

Set your party and proceed one screen upwards. While not immediately 
obvious in the next area, there's actually a fork here. Have Squall run 
up the head of the fossil, and follow the path to a cliff (you'll pass 
a 'Meteor' and 'Thundaga' Draw Point on the way). Hit 'X' (U.S) or
'Circle' (Japanese) at the edge of the cliff to leap off it, and follow
the snowy path to the north.

Side events: Vysages roam this area. Summon Siren to silence their
efforts (and laugh sadistically when they attempt to cast Esuna), and
steal a 'Life Ring' from Lefty if you haven't done so already. An
alternate way to mute them would be to junction 'Silence' to Status
Attack, and smack them with a weapon.

Take a right in the next screen for a save point. At 2 more screens 
left from the previous save point, you'll meet up with another 
fossil... only this time it's very much alive.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS: Abadon  HP: 17,010  Weak: Fire, Holy, Heal 
              Draw List: Cura, Esuna, Dispell  AP: 40

Have 2 characters summon Ifrit and Alexander while the remaining one 
attacks (junction Fira to Elemental Attack) or heals. If you've learnt 
Leviathan's 'Recover' command ability, use it to inflict 9,999 worth 
of damage on Abadon.

Sometimes Abadon will assume a standing posture (as opposed to its 
earlier hunched posture) in the duration of the fight. In this mode 
both physical and magical attacks are practically useless against it; 
cast Cure spells or the 'Recover' command on Abadon at this time to 
actually damage it. A 'Phoenix Down' on it also works, but it tends to
miss most of the time.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Head to the north-east when you're done. Have Squall examine the 
strange looking background to uncover an opening in mid-air. Climb up 
to it.   

[Esthar City]
Proceed to the right (it's a one-way path actually), screw around 
with the panel on the left if you want (it gives you a bit of info on
Esthar), then enter the door to the north-east.

Step through the door in front of you after the elevator stops for a 
nice FMV sequence introducing the capital city of Esthar.

#######################################################################
4m. [Final Laguna Dream Sequence: Lunatic Pandora Laboratory]

Enemies: Esthar Soldiers, Elastoid, Gesper
Draw Points: Death, Double, Flare
Magazines: Weapons Monthly First Issue (Lunatic Pandora Lab.)
Blue Magic: Homing Laser
#######################################################################

Laguna complains about the lack of meals to the soldiers; talk to both 
Esthar soldiers twice to get things moving. They tell Laguna to help
with some work upstairs.

Alternate your conversations between the Moomba and another man here 
to trigger a fight with an Esthar soldier.

Kiros and Ward will arrive now -- junction them first (1st option) 
before engaging more enemies in combat. You'll combat a Gesper and 2 
Esthar soldiers.

Get rid of the Gesper first; it has the annoying ability to remove a
character from the battle fray via its Degenerator. The darker Esthar
soldier knows 'Death', so you might want to be protected from that.

Enter the right elevator to reach the ground floor. You can eavesdrop 
on Dr. Odine's conversation with his assistants if you want, or just 
head right to exit. Save outside, and Laguna will be informed that Dr. 
Odine knows Ellone's whereabouts. Return to the Laboratory.

Pick up the final (or First, deciding how you look at it) issue of 
Weapons Monthly on the floor upon entering the complex. Head back to 
the basements to find Dr. Odine. You'll have to combat his cronies 
before chasing after him -- be sure to plunder a 'Laser Cannon' from 
the Elastoid! This allows Quistis to learn her 'Homing Laser'. Btw,
the Elastoid has to be at levels 30 and above first.

Laguna manages to squeeze some information out of him -- Ellone is 
located at Odine's Laboratory.

[Doctor Odine's Laboratory]
More enemies await you here, but Laguna can easily dispatch them. Check 
the circular object in the center; it's actually an elevator. Enter the 
door in front when you reach the 2nd floor.

Obliterate those pesky Estharians and look through the blue glass in 
the background to see Ellone. Examine the control panel to the right,
then descend back to the 1st floor. Step through the door in the
background (it should be openable now) to rescue Ellone. Laguna
apologizes for coming late.

#######################################################################
4n. [Esthar City]

Draw Points: Double, Flare, Blizzard, Quake, Tornado, Curaga
Magazines: Pet Pals Vol. 5 and 6 (Esthar Pet Store)
           Combat King 004 (Esthar Soldier)
           Occult Fans Vol. IV (Presidential Palace)
           ... plus almost any magazine, in fact
Rare Cards: Ward (Dr. Odine)
#######################################################################
 
Board the car to meet up with Odine at the Presidential Palace. He 
agrees to help, but on condition that Rinoa be left behind to be kept 
under observation. Doctor Odine holds Ward's card, btw. You can exit 
the Palace by heading down and taking a right to reach an elevator pod. 

Esthar is probably the largest city you'll ever come across in the 
whole of ff 8; below is a map I've constructed for your own reference:
(actually, I think the topography is *still* baffling...)

*at point X the straight path goes over the horizontal path; at point Y 
 the horizontal path goes over the straight path. You'll find a save
 -cum-heal point south-east from the Air Station. The points E and CK
 have no meaning now, but take note of their positions; you'll be
 needing them later.
 
 Some of the shops are open for business at this time, but those like
 'Cheryl's Shop' stay closed permanently. However, repeated visits to
 the same shop can sometimes throw up special gifts for the party; I
 managed to get a Rosetta Stone (lets a G.F. learn Ability x4 junction
 ability) from Cheryl's Shop. Also, make sure you've learnt Tonberry's
 'Familiar' menu ability; that should allow you to purchase all the
 remaining issues of Pet Pals and Combat King for Rinoa and Zell
 respectively. Purchase a 'Force Armlet' from the shopping mall as
 well. You'll need one of these for Rinoa's final weapon.

 Power Wrists are sold at the same Pet Store as well. You can use G.F
 Siren's 'Tools RF' menu ability to obtain 10 Aura Stones from a 
 single Power Wrist.

<!> Tip:
Aura (Stones) is a spell which dramatically increases the chances of
a character activating his or her limit break, even though their HP
may not be at critical status.

 Another store which seems to be closed (but isn't) is Johnny's. You 
 might have to visit it repeatedly to get it to open; he sells rare 
 recovery items such as X-Potions, Mega Phoenixes and Elixirs.

 You can also pick up the final volume of Occult Fans here. Speak
 with the Presidential Aide near the Air Station, then return to the
 Presidential Palace. Talk to the Presidential Secretary there, and
 he'll drop the magazine when he leaves.

 If you don't feel like purchasing a copy of Combat King 004, try
 finding a lone Esthar soldier in the city. I've marked his position
 with a 'CK' in the map above; speak to him once. He won't give you
 the magazine yet, but just remember his location. You'll be returning
 to him soon.

 When you're done shopping, you can exit Esthar. I advise you rent a
 car on your way out if you want to explore the region; it's huge.

#######################################################################
[Esthar Region] <optional>

Enemies: Bite Bug, Glacial Eye, Gayla (Estharian highways)
         Mesmerize, Malboro (Fields)
Blue Magic: Bad Breath
#######################################################################

Run around on the Esthar continent (not on the Estharian highways, 
mind you) to encounter Mesmerizes and Malboros (low encounter rate).
Malboros tend to appear on the West Coast of Esthar, and have a 'Bad
Breath' skill which causes every kind of status malady to all members,
but you're going to fight it. Here's how:

Have one character equipped with a 'Mug' command ability and junction
both 'Confuse' and 'Berserk' (or more if your G.F. allows it) to Status
Defense for the entire fighting party.

When you do encounter a Malboro (ugly green plants with a black mouth), 
the only malady from its 'Bad Breath' preventing the party from acting 
will be 'Sleep', so wait until the Malboro smacks you with a physical 
attack. Your primary goal will be to wake the character equipped with 
'Mug' up, so if the Malboro attacks someone else, have that someone 
else target your stealer, and have him/her steal from the Malboro
before you escape. You'll need 9 Malboro Tentacles in total. Use one of
them on Quistis for her to learn 'Bad Breath'.

Alternatively, you can utilize Pandemona's 'Initiative' character 
ability. This allows the particular character to always start a battle 
with a full time bar; have your stealer equipped with this, plunder 
quickly from the Malboro and escape. Remember to cure your characters 
after the fight!

You should have access to a total of 5 places (the Esthar City, Lunatic
Pandora Laboratory, Sorceress Memorial, Lunar Gate and Tears' Point) on
the Estharian continent. Check your map, and head to Tears' Point in the 
south-east. You can rent a car if you want to.

########################################################################
4o. [Tears' Point] (note: Check your map) <optional>

Draw Points: Life, Reflect
G.Fs: Doomtrain
########################################################################

Ominous-looking, isn't it? You'll need to proceed into the interior of 
this place; right under the giant statue in the core of Tears' Point 
will be a sparkling object - Solomon's Ring. 

You'll need to have 6 Malboro Tentacles, 6 Steel Pipes and 6 Remedy 
Pluses (I did tell you to get them earlier on, right?) before you use 
Solomon's Ring in the Item screen -- say hello to a new G.F, Doomtrain 
(Grasharaboras): ff 8's equivalent of ff 7's Hades.

Doomtrain enables a character to have Elemental Attack and Defense,
plus Status Attack and Defense junction abilities.

#######################################################################
4p. [Lunar Gate] (note: Check your map; it's to the east)
#######################################################################

Enter the complex, then talk to the girl standing at one of the gates.
Angelo will make her appearance; Squall assures her that they will 
save Rinoa.

Follow the Estharian to the blasting capsule, where he'll brief you on 
your space journey. He cautions Squall by saying that it'll be a bit 
dangerous:
- (... Space? Let me think about it.)
- (... I'll do whatever it takes.) *

You'll have to form a party consisting of Squall, Rinoa and another 
one of your companions other than Zell and Edea. You won't be doing
much fighting up in space, so take a 3rd character who's relatively
high in terms of levels.

Zell volunteers to take care of things down here:
- (... Not too sure about that.)
- (... Trust Zell.) *
The blast-off sequence commences shortly. Save outside, and return to
Esthar City as Zell.

#######################################################################
4q. [Lunatic Pandora Invasion -- Esthar City]

Enemies: G-Soldier, Elite Soldier, GIM52A
Magazines: Combat King 004 (Esthar Soldier)
#######################################################################

Stock up on items here, then pay a visit to the lone soldier again (see
previous Esthar City section). Converse with him, and when he leaves
he'll give Zell a copy of 'Combat King 004'.

Make your way to Odine's Laboratory afterwards. Be sure to have saved
your game first.

Inside, ride the elevator to meet up with Dr. Odine. He informs Zell 
that Galbadia has succeeded in recovering the Lunatic Pandora; Zell 
decides to sneak aboard to take a look. According to Odine, the Pandora 
should stop over at 3 points in Esthar within a period of 20 minutes:

15:00~12:00 -- Center of Esthar. You have 5 to 8 minutes to make it 
               there.
10:00~5:00 -- Juncture 'X' marked on the map above. It'll take about 
              10 to 15 minutes for the Pandora to reach there.
3:00~0:00 -- North of the Shopping Mall, where a dead end is marked. 
             You have 17 minutes to station yourselves there.

Boarding the Pandora as early as possible allows Zell to explore more 
of it. You can use the 'Square' button to view the locations of the 
stop-overs. I'll guide you to the 1st one:

1. Exit Odine's Laboratory.
2. Move 2 screens right when you reach the highway. You'll pass by 2 
   signs marked 'Left Side' and 'Right Side'.
3. Head up at the juncture.
4. Climb the stairs to your left.
5. You've reached the city center. The Presidential Palace should be 
   visible in the background. Wait for the Pandora. You have to defeat
   a few Galbadian troopers before actually getting into the Pandora.

########################################################################
4r. [Lunatic Pandora]

Enemies: G-Solider, Elite Soldier, GIM52A, SAM08G
Draw Points: Curaga, Meteor, Holy, Confuse, Silence, Ultima
G.Fs: Phoenix (Phoenix Pinion)
Magazines: Combat King 005
Blue Magic: Ray-Bomb
########################################################################

What you did in Laguna's 2nd Scenario (event 1p.) way back in Disc One
affects the areas accessible to you here. I'll assume you activated all
the traps during the 2nd Scenario.

If you didn't activate all the traps, then just head straight for the
green 01 elevator after climbing the stairs, and follow the trail (it
only splits once; take the northern path) to get dumped out of the
Pandora by a rather unfriendly machine.

Right from the start you'll find a 'Meteor' Draw Point (which recovers 
quite fast). Head up the stairs and take the blue 02 elevator. Follow
the path, and when it splits, take the left route.

Proceed (it's a one-way path anyway) until you reach a red 03
elevator. To the bottom-right of the screen should be a couple of
stairs. Run down from there to reach a ladder; descend to find a
'Confuse' DP. Go right into the tunnel to get a 'Love Love G', which is
hidden. You'll need to examine the area.

Head left from the 'Confuse' draw point, and you'll eventually see 3
opened doors. Each of them hides a gift. Starting from the right
door: 1 Power Generator (lets Quistis learn Ray-Bomb), a 'Silence'
draw point, followed by a Phoenix Pinion.

Proceed further left to find a copy of 'Combat King 005' on the ground.
Head all the way into the background, then go left and examine a hidden
area to the left of the door for an 'Ultima' draw point. Make your way
back to the red 03 elevator you passed earlier on.

The red elevator should take you back to the lobby. Make your way left 
and board the green 01 elevator. You'll find a 'Holy' DP here. There's
also a small alcove to the left of the screen; examine it to find a
'Spd-J Scroll'.

A save point awaits when you move north. Directly above it will be 
a fork in the route; choose the northern one for the party to be
rather unceremoniously kicked out of the Pandora. All other routes
in the Pandora lead to dead-ends.

Draw Points: Meteor, Meltdown
Rare Cards: Alexander (Piet), Laguna (Ellone)
########################################################################

Squall will wake up at the Lunar Dock. Run over to pick up Rinoa, then
follow Piet into the Med Lab. Place Rinoa in the chamber, save and exit.

Outside the Med Lab, keep moving up to reach the Control Room. Examine
the panels to the upper-right for a short sequence before talking to
Piet. Choose the 2nd option to ask about Ellone's whereabouts.
Incidentally, Piet holds G.F. Alexander's card, but it'll take a while
to win it due to the 'Random' rule here. Leave the Control Room.

Squall will see a flight of stairs to the left of the screen. Ascend 
that and go through the door. You can talk to the girl standing in the 
tunnel (take note of the Locker Room to the right) for a sequence 
introducing Adel. Proceed down the corridor.

Ellone will be waiting for you behind the door to the south, but before 
you talk to her, have Squall initiate Card Battle. She holds Laguna's 
card, which when refined gives you 100 of those Hero's Medicine. These
items will make your quest ridiculously easy. However, expect the 
'Random' rule to cause a lot of resetting and replaying on your part. 

Squall will ask of Ellone to take a look at Rinoa, but an accident 
prevents them from getting any further. Head to the Med Lab. Squall
will be powerless to stop Rinoa (he'll be bounced away each time you
try to get near), so just retrace your steps back to the Control Room.
Check the panel after Rinoa has made her presence felt.

Next, tail Rinoa to the 2F Locker Room... you'll witness a 'Lunar
Cry', the same catastrophe which destroyed the Centra continent 80
years ago. Enter the Locker Room now, and examine the lockers for
Squall's astronaut outfit. Head to the air lock on the left. It'll be
a futile pursuit for Rinoa; make your way into the foreground after the
air lock shuts, and return to the Control Room.

Converse with everyone here, followed by Ellone. Head right to reach an
elevator, and descend using it. Save when you reach the bottom, then
proceed right. Enter the un-occupied escape pod.

[Escape Pod]
Squall pleads with Ellone to transfer him into Rinoa's memories; Ellone 
lets him witness 3 separate incidents: one involves Rinoa forcing 
Irvine to turn back to D-District Prison to rescue the rest; another has 
Rinoa asking Zell if he could help her get a replica of Squall's ring.

*spoiler here... skip this paragraph if you wish*
The final one will be a scene after defeating Edea in Galbadia Garden. 
Squall watches as Ultimecia transfers herself from Edea into Rinoa's 
body... she wakes Seifer up, and orders him to salvage the Pandora.

Squall decides to risk his life to try save Rinoa. Upon climbing out 
of the escape pod, you have to play a mini-game:

Use the d-pad and mash away at the 'Triangle' (U.S) or 'X' (Japanese)
button to adjust Squall's point of view until you see Rinoa in the
center of the screen. Keep her positioned in the center, and when the
timer hits zero you'll be reunited. A bit of a no-brainer, actually.
Enjoy the FMV sequence!

Check the panel to the left to close the air lock, then proceed upwards. 
Rinoa will playfully ask Squall for a hug ^_^ Anyway, head up one more 
screen when she's done.

You'll find that you have company... aliens. They have the ability to 
regenerate themselves when you kill them; the only solution is to 
defeat them in pairs. 

By that I mean out of the 8 aliens you find on board the Ragnarok, 
there'll be a pair of yellow, red, green and purple aliens. You must 
kill 2 of the same kind *consecutively*. However, these guys attack
the moment they spot you, so you have to be quick to dodge them.

Start your alien hunt (remember to junction your party) by heading to 
the right and descending the steps. You'll find a purple one at the 
bottom of the stairs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS: Propagator  HP: 3,800
                  Draw List: Thundaga, Esuna, Life, Curaga  AP: 5

These guys share the same statistics. Well, they're quick on the 
offensive and like to cast both 'Thundara' and 'Silence', so you might
want to be well-protected from these 2 spells. Actually, what I usually
do with them is to have Squall and Rinoa junction 'Sleep' to Status 
Attack -- they're pretty weak against that. Make sure your 2 members 
have a high Strength rating for a quick and effortless victory.
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

There'll be 2 doors in front of you; take the left one. Behind this door 
lurks a red alien -- you don't want to face him now, so make a beeline 
for the door to the left upon entering this area to dodge his charge. 
The next room holds a purple alien. Toast him.

Back-track to the previous room now, and defeat the red alien. Go 
through the door to the south, back to where you fought your 1st 
purple alien. Climb the stairs to the right to find yet another red 
alien for the kill. 

Descend back down to the 1F. This time, enter the door in the 
upper-right corner (it's a bit hard to see it) to pay a visit to a 
green alien. 

Save here when you're done with him. Now go to where you 1st met a 
red alien, then move 2 screens left to find a green one. He'll be 
number six to go down.

Look for a door to the left; step through to face a yellow alien in 
the Passenger Deck. The panel behind it tells Squall what you already 
know: defeat the eight aliens in pairs of the same colour. 

Finally, proceed back to where you first entered the Ragnarok; you'll 
find your last yellow alien along the way. You know what to do with 
him, don't you? Save afterwards.

Make your way back to where you found your 2nd green alien, and 
ascend the elevator it guarded. Enjoy the romantic little scene with 
Squall and Rinoa.

*spoiler here... skip this section if you wish*
As Rinoa snuggles up to Squall, the latter asks why she wants to be 
so close to him. Rinoa responds by saying, "Isn't this what Squall 
wants?" ^_^ but Squall says he's a bit un-accustomed. 
Upon further questioning, Squall admits that he dislikes being tied 
down by emotions... because he's afraid of losing his loved ones. 
Later on, when Rinoa is identified as the witch who freed Adel, Squall 
comforts her, believing she has led him down the right path... and that 
he'll never let go of her.

     Lyrics by Kazumi Someya

     Whenever sang my songs
     On the stage, on my own
     Whenever said my words
     Wishing they would be heard
     I saw you smiling at me
     Was it real or just my fantasy
     You'd always be there in the corner
     Of this tiny little bar 
         
     My last night here for you
     Same old songs, just once more
     My last night here with you?
     Maybe yes, maybe no
     I kind of liked it your way
     How you shyly placed your eyes on me
     Oh, did you ever know?
     That I had mine on you 
         
     Darling, so there you are
     With that look on your face
     As if you're never hurt
     As if you're never down
     Shall I be the one for you
     Who pinches you softly but sure
     If frown is shown then
     I will know that you are no dreamer 
         
     So let me come to you
     Close as I wanna be
     Close enough for me
     To feel your heart beating fast
     And stay there as I whisper
     How I loved your peaceful eyes on me
     Did you ever know
     That I had mine on you 
         
     Darling, so share with me
     Your love if you have enough
     Your tears if you're holding back
     Or pain if that's what it is
     How can I let you know
     I'm more than the dress and the voice
     Just reach me out then
     You will know that you're not dreaming

[Ragnarok]
After Rinoa's departure, head back into the Passenger Deck of the 
Ragnarok. Squall will be reprimanded by Quistis for not stopping 
Rinoa... he decides to reclaim his love from the Estharians. Proceed 
to the cockpit of the Ragnarok to launch the ship.

<Piloting the Ragnarok>

The Ragnarok can land on practically any terrain, with the exception
of forests, water and some cities. It doesn't consume any Fuel either,
so fly it all you want.

Btw, the Ragnarok has an auto-pilot feature. Hit 'Select' until you 
get to view the full world map, move the cursor to your destination 
and push the 'X' (U.S) or 'Circle' (Japanese) button to confirm. Press
the cancel button while the Ragnarok is on auto-pilot mode to switch
this function off.

Some of you may wonder how to get back into Fishermans Horizon or
Balamb Garden; simply fly the Ragnarok over F.H, and land.

5c. [Sorceress Memorial]

Draw Points: Stop
########################################################################

It's located on the Estharian continent, south of Lunatic Pandora 
Laboratory. Check your map. 

Just run into the complex, where the Esthar guards will let Squall 
through to see Rinoa one last time. Of course, Squall has other ideas. 
Head to the upper-left opening to rescue Rinoa when the party makes 
their intentions clear to the engineers there. You can leave now.

[Ragnarok]
Back in the cockpit of the Ragnarok, Rinoa apologises for the trouble 
she had caused. She suggests heading to Edea's Orphanage for a quieter 
and less crowded environment.

But before you do that, a wide array of optional events have been 
opened up with the acquisition of the Ragnarok... I suggest you do 
them first before proceeding to Edea's Orphanage.

Also, Rinoa will be behind some of your members in levels... make sure
you build her up, and don't neglect resuming learning her 'Combine' 
limit breaks with Angelo.

She has also learnt a new limit break, 'Angel Wing'. This skill puts
her in 'Berserked' status, but she'll cast spells (NOT from your
stocked magic lists) at random instead of doing physical attacks. Each
spell used under this condition by Rinoa hits for approximately 5
times the damage.

#######################################################################
5d. [Cactuar Desert] <optional>

Enemies: Cactuar
G.Fs: Cactuar
#######################################################################

To the east of Kashkabald Desert on the Centra continent will be a
small island. You will be able to spot a Cactuar appearing and 
disappearing at random on this island, so land your Ragnarok and run 
over to confront it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS G.F: Jumbo Cactuar  HP: 60,000  Weak: Water  
                         Draw List: Meltdown, Demi, Tornado  AP: 20

This guy has a few pretty nasty attacks; it'll slam itself down on your
party, causing moderate sums of damage to everyone, or cast '10,000 
Needles' which damages a character for 10,000 HP, so stock up on those 
Phoenix Downs and Life spells. G.F. Alexander's 'Revive' command
ability's useful too.

What you'll want to do here is to junction 'Water' to Elemental Attack 
and have Leviathan at the ready. Cast 'Meltdown' if you have it. If 
Squall gets hit by '10,000 Needles', revive him with a Phoenix Down, 
but don't heal him -- his Renzokuken works well on the Jumbo Cactuar.

After enduring quite a bit of damage, the Jumbo Cactuar may begin to
hesitate; cease all weak attacks, and finish it off with Leviathan or
Renzokuken. Otherwise, it'll run away, and you'll have to start all
over again.
 
You'll acquire a new G.F. for your troubles. Btw, *only* Cactuars 
appear on this island, so head here the next time you want some A.P.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

G.F. Cactuar offers a wide variety of level up bonuses such as 
'HP Bonus' and 'Vitality Bonus' character ability. Junction it to a 
party member who's about to gain a level to make full use of them.

########################################################################
5e. [Deep Sea Research Center Part One] <optional>

Enemies: Anacondaur, Blood Soul, Ruby Dragon
G.Fs: Bahamut
Rare Cards: Bahamut
Blue Magic: Fire Breath
########################################################################

It's not on the map, but it's located out in the open seas in the 
south-western corner of the world. Land your ship on it, and make your 
way into the interior of the building.

Inside will be a spinning blue light which goes on and off at random. 
Walk only when the light is turned off, and keep inching your way 
towards the blue core. You'll be forced into combat should you move 
with the lights on.

Upon reaching the center, examine it and select the 1st option. The
following chain of events will see you getting involved in 3 
consecutive battles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
ENEMY: Ruby Dragon  HP: Variable  Weak: Ice, Holy  
                    Strong vs.: Fire, Wind
                    Draw List: Firaga, Reflect, Flare, Meteor  AP: 14

It's much tougher this time around, and its 'Breath' attack can take 
away quite a substantial amount of damage. The previous tactics you 
used against it don't work quite as well as they used to, so just 
cast 'Meltdown' on it and have Squall unleash his Renzokuken.

If they drop a 'Inferno Fang', use it on Quistis for her to learn
'Fire Breath'. Junction 'Firaga' to Elemental Defense beforehand for
these battles. Or you could simply use G.F. Tonberry's 'Level Down'
command ability on the Ruby Dragon (hey, it's only an enemy, not a boss).

(note: You can obtain 10 Aura Stones by refining a Power Wrist through
 Siren's 'Tools Refinement' Menu Ability. Power Wrists are purchasable
 from the Pet Store in Esthar's Shopping Mall.)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Re-examine the core and take the 2nd option for another fight with a 
Ruby Dragon. You begin this one with your backs turned, so be careful!
If you're lucky enough, Odin will step in both times to help you finish
off the dragons.

Search the panel one last time and pick the invisible 3rd option.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS G.F: Bahamut  HP: 65,200  Strong vs.: Poison, Thunder, Wind
                   Draw List: Flare, Curaga, Full-life, Dispell  AP: 40

Bahamut has a pretty high offensive rating, and if you take too long 
to defeat him, his Mega Flare will take away roughly 4,000 HPs of 
damage from everyone. Minimise damage with 'Protect' and 'Shell'.
Bahamut's also weak against 'Blind'.

Simply use the same tactic outlined for the Ruby Dragons above (cast
Meltdown on Bahamut, use Aura on Squall, followed by his Renzokuken)
and you should do just fine. Bahamut will give up his card when you
defeat him; change this using Quezacotl's 'Card Mod.' menu ability for
a whopping 100 Megalixirs!
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bahamut will be one of your best G.Fs; be sure to learn his 'Rare Item'
party ability. Bahamut also offers the Ability x4 junction ability.

Leave the island for now, and talk to everyone (especially Zell) once
you're back on the Ragnarok. Head to the nearest town (Winhill), stock
up on curative spells, items, re-organize your party and save.

########################################################################
5f. [Deep Sea Research Center Part Two] (note: You'll need to have Zell
                                               in your party)
                                               <optional>

Enemies: Bomb, Behemoth, Grendel, Tri-Face, Imp, Blue Dragon, Ruby
         Dragon, Iron Giant
Draw Points: Triple, Dispel, Ultima, Esuna
G.Fs: Eden (Ultima Weapon)
Rare Cards: Eden (Ultima Weapon)
########################################################################

This event occurs after you've spoken with everyone in the cockpit of
the Ragnarok. Actually, you can choose to do this event without Zell's
help, but I'm too lazy to write an alternate walkthrough ^_^

There should be a thick vine where the hole previously was; descend 
into the depths of the island using that. Due to the relative 
inactivity of the place, you have to make use of the island's remaining 
power to reach the bottom.

You'll need 4 out of 20 reserve steam power units to open the 1st gate,
according to the computer you come across upon descending from the vine.
Go through the now opened hatch in the floor.

On a side note, the enemies you encounter here can get annoying. Use
Quistis 'Degenerator' blue magic if you have it to plow through them.
A majority of them are also weak against 'Sleep'.

Examine the computer on the next floor, and use 2 units of power to 
open the hatch. Proceed down.

The next screen will have 2 doors, controlled by 2 computers. If Zell 
is in your party, you can ignore the door to the left (which 
incidentally, is also controlled by the computer to the left) and 
examine the right computer. Have it use 1 unit of power to open the 
hatch in the floor. Head down.

For the upcoming floors, just use 1 unit of power to open the hatches. 
When you do reach the bottom via an elevator, Zell will repair the
machinery you see to open the gate to the left (2nd option). Step
through this gate to find a save point a bit further down.

Follow the one-way path until you reach the very bottom of this island. 
You should locate a save point and a red computer panel. Go for the 
former first (use Siren's 'Move-Find' party ability to see it), then
examine the computer panel.

<!> Tip:
Make sure someone has the 'Draw' command; you won't want to miss out
on the most powerful G.F in the upcoming battle.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS: Ultima Weapon  HP: 100,000  
                     Draw List: Regen, Dispell, Ultima, Eden  AP: 100

Draw G.F. Eden from it right from the start. Apart from having a 
ridiculously high offensive rating, the Ultima Weapon's 'Light Pillar' 
attack can take away 9,999 worth of HP damage from a single member. 
Keep those Phoenix Downs at the ready!

When it's not using 'Light Pillar' (which it does too frequently), the
Ultima Weapon's capable of 'Gravija', 'Quake' and 'Meteor' too.

Cast Meltdown on the Ultima Weapon, followed by Aura on Squall. Have
him (with a high Strength and Speed rating) unleash his Renzokuken.
Your remaining members should just heal, and if you can spare a few
turns, draw 'Ultima' spells from the Weapon.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

You'll get 100 Ultima Stones and Eden's card for your efforts. Save and 
exit. Eden should be your last and only G.F. that's capable of doing 5 
digit damage. It also has the 'G.F Ability Med. Refinement' menu
ability, in addition to a quirky little command ability called Devour.
When consumed, certain enemies yield status bonuses such as
'Strength +1', i.e. the T-Rexaur. Here's a more or less complete list:

Adamantoise: Devour at levels 30-100 for 'Vitality +1'.
Behemoth: Devour at levels 40-100 for 'Magic +1'.
Malboro: Devour at levels 30-100 for 'Spirit +1'.
PuPu: Devour at levels 30-100 for 'Speed +1'.
Ruby Dragon: Devour at levels 45-100 for 'Max. HP +10'.
T-Rexaur: Devour at levels 30-100 for 'Strength +1'.

You might have yet to encounter some enemies stated above; they'll
appear soon enough if you continue reading this guide.

Side events: You'll face a plethora of powerful enemies here. These 
include Iron Giants, Blue Dragons, Ruby Dragons and Behemoths. Should
you choose to fight them, Tonberry's 'Level Down' command will be 
helpful, along with Quistis' Degenerator. Most the enemies are also
weak against 'Sleep', so use that to your advantage.

#######################################################################
5g. [Shumi Tribe Village Revisited 2] <optional>
#######################################################################

Laguna's statue should be completed by now. Converse with the Shumis 
and the guests from F.H at the Workshop, followed by the village head
before you leave.

Btw, the 'Ultima' Draw Point should be your main source of Ultima 
spells, so be sure to return here occasionally! You won't be able to 
re-enter the Shumi Tribe Village on Disc Four (or any other town for 
that matter).

#######################################################################
5h. [UFO Sightings] <optional>

Enemies: UFO, PuPu
Rare Cards: PuPu
#######################################################################

Sometimes in a battle, you'll notice that Squall appears to be facing 
an invisible adversary... only for an UFO to appear and disappear. 
Here're the 4 locations where you should encounter this:

1. Along the eastern shores of the Timber continent (Mandy Beach,
   which is south-east of Roshfall Forest).  
2. Around the Winhill Bluffs region.
3. On the island east of Trabia Garden (Trabia Heath Peninsula region). 
4. In Kashkabald Desert (Centra region).

The UFO appears even if you've got 'Encounter None' equipped. Use that
party ability to speed up your search, and to avoid unwanted battles.
You only need to encounter it once in each of the 4 areas.

Once you've sighted it 4 times, proceed to the cliffs north of the 
Chocobo Sanctuary and Grandidi Forest, in the north-east on the
Overworld, and land your Ragnarok there. Run around a bit to encounter
the UFO; defeat it.

Now having at least 5 Elixirs on hand (purchasable from Johnny's Shop
in Esthar's Shopping Mall, or use Alexander's 'Medicine Level Up' menu
ability to further refine 10 Remedy Pluses), head to the Balamb region 
for another meeting with the UFO. Use the 5 Elixirs on PuPu to receive
its card. You can choose to kill it, but I think the rewards aren't as
great (an Accelerator, which earns a G.F the 'Auto Haste' ability).

You can modify this card for a 'Hungry Cookpot', then further refine
this via Siren's 'Tools Refinement' menu ability to obtain a 'Shaman
Stone'. Finally, use Eden's 'G.F. Ability Med. RF' menu ability to
get a Rosetta Stone (lets a G.F. learn 'Ability x4' junction ability).

#######################################################################
5i. [Islands Closest to Heaven & Hell] <optional>

Enemies: Chimera, Grendel, Malboro, Hexadragon, Blue Dragon, Ruby
         Dragon, T-Rexaur
Draw Points: Aura, Full-life, Tornado, Quake, Flare, Meteor, Holy,
             Ultima, Triple
G.Fs: Doomtrain
#######################################################################  

The Heaven Island is located near the Chocobo Sanctuary and is 
north-east of Esthar. The Hell Island is located to the south-west of 
Deling City (use your menu screen to get the name of your current
location). Both islands hold numerous draw points on them, some of
which include Flare, Holy, Meteor, Aura, Triple and Ultima. They're
all hidden, though.

These points recover quite fast, and will be your source of high class 
spells in ff 8. However, the enemies you'll find here will *always* be 
at lv. 100. They include Malboros, Blue Dragons, Ruby Dragons, 
Hexadragons, T-Rexaurs and Grendels. Equip Diablos' 'Encounter None' 
party ability for an easier time picking up spells.

Btw, if you've yet to get G.F Doomtrain, steal 6 Malboro Tentacles
from the Malboros on the Heaven or Hell Island. Combine this with 6
Steel Pipes (mug low-level Wendigos) and 6 Remedy Pluses (use G.F
Alexander's 'Med. Level Up' menu ability to refine 60 Remedies). Next,
locate the Solomon Ring at Tears' Point and use it in the Item screen.

#######################################################################
5j. [Timber Region: Obel Lake Quest] <optional>
#######################################################################

When you examine the lake north of Timber, Squall will be presented 
with 2 options:
- Throw a rock.
- Try humming.
Hum to have a shadow in the lake talk to you; it'll ask of Squall 
to locate a monkey. Head on over to the forest west of Dollet; run 
around a bit in there until a message pops up to say the animal was 
sighted. You may need to keep pressing the 'X' (U.S) or 'Circle' 
(Japanese) button for that to happen.

Report back to the shadow and it'll hint at the existence of 4 special 
rocks in the world. To get clues for the locations of all 4 rocks, 
have Squall throw a rock until it bounces six times (this occurs
randomly) before humming again for the shadow. The 4 locations are:

1. Along the shores of Balamb. You'll have to find a rock with an
   inscription on it.
2. The tiny island to the east of Timber, north of the Horizon Bridge.
3. The cliffs south of Galbadia Garden (or what used to be the Garden). 
   You have to land the Ragnarok on the cliff above the waterfall 
   nearby. Examine the ground above the waterfall.
4. The forest west of Dollet.

Examine these locations with the 'X' (U.S) or 'Circle' (Japanese) to
find the rocks. Each has it own unique inscription.

When rearranged, you'll get a message from the 4 rocks about a hidden 
treasure in the plains north of Esthar. Pilot your Ragnarok over there, 
and comb the Mordred Plains. You can't trigger the hidden treasure event
unless you locate all 4 rocks first.

There'll be tons of talking stones (Moais?) here; try to locate a red
one, and go the opposite direction it tells you to. Keep searching and
you'll eventually find a red stone which tells you that, "The treasure
is not here." 

Examine the same area again to obtain a 'Three Stars' item, which grants
a G.F. the 'Expendx3-1' character ability (use 3 spells in a row for the
cost of only 1).

If you need a hint, I'll say it's located in the south-east of the 
plains, but not too far away from the center of it. Happy searching! 
It took me quite a while too.

Apart from this event, the shadow will drop several other hints... one
will be regarding another hidden treasure; head for Eldbeak Peninsula,
which is on Trabia, north from Balamb. Examine the tip of the peninsula
to get an inscription: "TRETIMEASUREATMINOFFDEISLE"

Fly the Ragnarok over to Minde Isle, which is a small island south-west
of Esthar City. Search the southern regions of the island for a 'Luck-J
Scroll'.

"Back in the day, south of here, there used to be a small but beautiful
village surrounded by deep forests. Everyone lived a happy life there."
He's simply telling you about a forgotten village, located in a
clearing in a strangely shaped forest to the east of Edea's Orphanage.
Search the area to see Squall's comments, but you won't get anything
for this.

The other hint about taking a break at railroad bridges simply refers
to the hidden draw points found on them.

5l. [Edea's Orphanage Revisited] (note: Take Rinoa along)

Rare Cards: Edea (Edea), Seifer (Cid)
########################################################################

Follow Angelo to a field of flowers. It's to the left of where you
entered the orphanage.

*spoiler here... skip this paragraph if you wish*
Rinoa confides in Squall of her worries, that one day Ultimecia will 
awaken the sorceress within her. Squall says that there can always be
a kind-hearted sorceress, but is unable to answer when Rinoa tells of
her fear that the world will turn against her. However, Squall promises 
Rinoa that he'll defeat Ultimecia for her sake... and in turn makes 
her promise that she'll never leave his side (this is actually a 
reference to the strange opening of ff 8, because both Squall and 
Rinoa say the same words as those appearing in the opening).

Go into the Orphanage to meet up with Edea. According to her, there's 
a special person who can dispell a sorceress' fears -- her Knight. 
Edea advises Rinoa to leave her safety in the hands of such a 
person... upon which Rinoa responds to by looking at Squall -- she's 
already found her Knight ^_^ You can leave now for Esthar.

Side events: If you haven't done so already, Edea and Cid hold Edea's 
and Seifer's card respectively, so you might want to take time off to 
get them. It won't be easy winning those cards, though.

5m. [Esthar President -- Esthar City]

Enemies: Imp, Iron Giant, Turtapod, Imp, Elnoyle (rare)
Rare Cards: Squall (Esthar President)
#######################################################################

Now that you have the Ragnarok, you can land directly in Esthar. Try
looking around for a tall building with a landing pad on it -- that
should be the Esthar Air-Station. It's more convenient compared to
landing outside Esthar City, then making your way across the highways.

It'll be populated by monsters as a result of the Lunar Cry; head to 
the Presidential Palace as soon as possible. Follow the path all the 
way left when Squall gets off the elevator pod.

<!> Tip:
If you've yet to visit Edea at her Orphanage, then Squall won't be
allowed to meet the Esthar President.

You'll finally meet up with the President of Esthar. When Squall talks 
to him, you'll have 4 topics to ask him about:
- Explain the mission to defeat Ultimecia.
- Where's Ellone?
- Tell me about Raine.
- What are you doing here? (follow this one with the 1st choice to make 
  him continue his story)
You can choose the first option to move the plot quickly, but I suggest 
you take time off to see what he has been up to for the past few years.

*spoiler here... skip this paragraph if you wish*
Basically, Laguna journeys off to Esthar to rescue Ellone, who was one 
of the many taken as a possible successor to Adel's rule during her 
time. However, Adel recognizes Ellone's hidden talents and decides to 
take her power... only to be betrayed by her own lust for power as
Laguna tricks her into entering the sealing capsule, which a holographic
image of Ellone had been beamed onto. They use the Ragnarok to station
the sealed up Adel in space, but with the sudden loss of a President,
Esthar falls into confusion; thus under the name of a 'hero', Laguna 
was elected as the new President. 

Taking the first option results in an elaborate explanation by Doctor
Odine. It's rather confusing too. When he's done, the President will
volunteer to continue the briefing aboard the Ragnarok:
- Yes.
- I have questions.
I'll leave this up to you. 

*spoiler here... skip this section if you wish*
Next, I'll *attempt* to summarize Odine's plan:
Truth be told, Ultimecia exists in Squall's time only in her mental 
state; her physical self is stationed in the future. However, being a 
sorceress herself, Ultimecia can only possess the sorceress of each era. 
This technique of transferring one's mind between time is only used by 
Ellone in Squall's era, but apparently in the future, anyone has the 
ability to do this, thanks to an invention by Doctor Odine. To defeat
Ultimecia, the party will have to travel to the future to confront her
physical being.
Ultimecia's goal is to cause total time compression, which is the 
reason why she has come to this time seeking Ellone's powers. To make 
her task easier, she has to possess the most powerful sorceress of this 
era, which will be Adel. Thus, after rescuing Ellone from the Pandora,
Squall will have to seek out the un-awakened Adel and defeat her,
forcing Ultimecia to possess Rinoa instead.
This is when Ellone steps in. To bait Ultimecia (whose aim is to travel 
even further back in time), she'll transport both Rinoa and Ultimecia 
into the past minds of the sorceresses before this time. Ultimecia 
will then initiate time compression, upon which Ellone will immediately 
cut both of them off from the past.
With time compressed now, Squall and company will have to head for the 
future, where the final confrontation with Ultimecia awaits.  
*end spoiler*

Side events: The President of Esthar holds Squall's card, quite 
possibly the best in the game. Be sure to win it from him.
Also, in Esthar itself will be a creature known as the Elnoyle, a 
black and yellow winged demon which resembles the Elvoret you fought 
way back in Dollet in Disc One.

You can encounter them randomly (low encounter rate) or look for a 
black creature standing on one of the highways in Esthar (point E on 
the map I've drawn up above in the Esthar City section, event 4n).
It'll simply laugh when Squall talks to it, but you have to fight it.
Exit and re-enter this screen for it to reappear again.

You can steal Moon Stones from the Elnoyle, or defeat it when they're
at levels 40 and above to make it drop Energy Crystals. Both are
essential items for weapon upgrading; get a Moon Stone and 8 Energy
Crystals from it.

Also, you can refine Energy Crystals via Ifrit's 'Refine Ammo' menu
ability to get Pulse Ammo. These are Irvine's best ammunition for his
'Shot' limit break.

[Ragnarok]
The Esthar President will summarize what Odine has said, but I think it 
only serves to confuse one even more ^_^

If you re-enter the Passenger Deck after the briefing, both Kiros
and Ward will drop clues about Squall's parents...

Anyway, your next destination will be Lunatic Pandora (it's floating 
right over Tears' Point) in the south-east of the Esthar region, but 
going there means proceeding onto Disc Four. I suggest you do a bit of 
running around before that to upgrade your weapons one last time, and 
pick up any items you may have missed.

5n. [Miscellaneous Updates Part Three] (note: I recommend you at least
                                        read through this section)

Enemies: Adamantoise (Long Horn Island)
         Torama, Behemoth, Iron Giant, Elnoyle (Esthar)
Rare Cards: Ward (Dr. Odine), Squall (Esthar President), Alexander
            (Piet), Kiros, Irvine, Chubby Chocobo, Doomtrain, Phoenix
            (Card Queen Quest)

            Fire Breath, Homing Laser, Bad Breath
Weapons: Lion Heart (Squall), Shooting Star (Rinoa), Ehrgeiz (Zell),
         Save the Queen (Quistis), Strange Vision (Selphie), Exeter
         (Irvine)
#######################################################################

{Weapons}
Let's start with the weapons first. 

Head to Long Horn Island, which is the narrow stretch of land 
consisting mostly of beaches north-west of Dollet. You can encounter 
Adamantoises (turtle-like creatures) here. First, plunder a 'Whisper'
(at levels 29 and below) from it, then defeat one of them for it to
drop Adamantine (at levels 30 and above). Win at least 3 of those.
Incidentally, Adamantine lets a G.F. learn 'Vitality +60%' character
ability, so get more of it if you can. Use Bahamut's 'Rare Item' party
ability to assist you. Adamantoises occasionally (but ONLY) appear on
the beaches.

Pilot Ragnarok over to the Esthar region and encounter enemies. You 
should find Toramas (long-whiskered leopards), Behemoths (enormous 
purple beasts -- low encounter rate) and Iron Giants (blue giants 
carrying swords). Plunder from all of them to receive Regen Rings 
(get 1 of these), Barrier (1 will do) and Star Fragments (get 5 of
these) respectively.

On a side note, a single Regen Ring can be refined using Siren's 'Life
Magic Refinement' menu ability to 20 'Full-life' spells -- these are
excellent junctioned to HP.

Squall's Lion Heart: One Adamantine, 4 Dragon Fangs (Blue Dragons on 
the Island Closest to Hell near Galbadia drop them - kill them
effortlessly with a 'Death' spell) and 12 Pulse Ammo (refine 2 Energy
Crystals via Ifrit's 'Refine Ammo' menu ability. Or you could refine
Laser Cannons dropped rarely by Belhelmels in the region near Galbadia
Garden). The Lion Heart's finishing move, 'Lion Heart' (End of Heart)
should be your most powerful attack in the entire game.

Rinoa's Shooting Star: 2 Windmills (steal from level 30 and above
Thrustaevis - blue flying creatures - in the Timber region), 1 Regen
Ring, 1 Force Armlet (it's purchasable from the Pet Store in Esthar)
and 2 Energy Crystals (dropped by level 40 and above Elnoyles in
Esthar City).

Zell's Ehrgeiz: One Adamantine, 4 Dragon Skins (level 30 and above
Anacondaurs near the cliffs west of Dollet drop these) and one
Fury Fragment (mug Blue Dragons on the Island Closest to Hell).

Quistis' Save the Queen: 2 Malboro Tentacles (Malboros are found on
the Island Closest to Heaven or Hell), 4 Sharp Spikes (stolen from
Grand Mantis in the forests on the Centra continent) and 4 Energy
Crystals.

Selphie's Strange Vision: One Adamantine, 3 Star Fragments and 2 Curse
Spikes (level 20-29 Creeps in the sewers of Deling City drop them, and
so do level 30 and above Forbiddens in the Centra Ruins).

Irvine's Exeter: 2 Dino Bones (T-Rexaurs in Balamb Garden's Training 
Center and Hell Island drop these), 1 Moon Stone (mug Elnoyles in
Esthar City), 2 Star Fragments and 18 screws (from Geezards near the
cliffs of Galbadia and Dollet).

If you're wondering where Energy Crystals and Moon Stones come from,
try reading the 'Side events' in the previous section detailing your
meeting with the Esthar President.

{Blue Magic}

Next up, Quistis' remaining Blue Magicks. Use the Barrier you stole
from the Behemoth on her for her 'Mighty Guard' and the Whisper (from
the Adamantoise) for her 'White Wind'.

Also, level 30 and above Blitzs in the Centra forests carry Power
Generators; you'll have to mug them for it. However, the chances of
obtaining one is extremely rare; about 4.7%, to be exact. Most of the
time you'll get Betrayal Blades instead. Power Generators earn Quistis
her 'Ray-Bomb'.

Finally, collect 100 Curse Spikes from level 20-29 Creeps in the Deling
sewers or level 30 and above Forbiddens (skeletons armed with 2 swords)
from the Centra Ruins, then use Siren's 'Tools RF' menu ability to
receive Dark Matter and thus Quistis' final Enemy Skill, the Shockwave
Pulsar, one of only three sources in the whole of ff 8 which can do 5
digit damage (the other 2 attacks being G.F. Eden's 'Eternal Breath'
and Choco Buckle). 'Dark Matter' can only be refined when G.F. Siren's
at level 100.

(note: The Choco Buckle can only be gotten if you have a Pocket
       Station peripheral, which is sold separately. I won't detail
       the procedure here.)

Another 3 Enemy Skills which you may have forgotten would be her Fire 
Breath, Homing Laser and Bad Breath. Get the items from Ruby Dragons
on the Island Closest to Hell (mug them for Inferno Fangs), level 30
and above Belhelmels (rarely drop Laser Cannons when defeated) in the
ex-Galbadia Garden region (Monterosa Plateau), and Malboros on the
Island Closest to Heaven or Hell respectively.

{Rare Cards}

Once you've met all the CC Group members in Balamb Garden, you can
challenge the Card Queen outside Balamb City's train station. This
sparks off a Card Queen Quest which lets you complete your collection
of rare cards in ff 8. I'll detail it a bit further below. 

I'll give you an (easier) method of completing your card collection in
Disc Four later, though. Incidentally, if you forgot to get Ward's and
Squall's card, they're still winnable from Dr. Odine at his Laboratory
in Esthar City and the President of Esthar in the Passenger Deck of
the Ragnarok respectively.

Also, G.F. Alexander's card can still be won from Piet; he's located
at one of the southern tips of the Esthar continent, in the Abadan
Plains. You can't see him on the Overworld directly; you'll need to
actually run into the specific area to enter a field screen.

[Card Queen Quest]

The Queen of Cards resides outside the train station in Balamb City.
Upon winning or losing any level 8 or higher rare card from/to her,
she'll leave. Talk to her again to know where she's going. Below are
the 8 possible locations she can move to:

Balamb: Train station in Balamb City
Centra: Winhill's hotel
Dollet: Dollet 2F Pub
Esthar: Presidential Palace in Esthar City
F.H: Railway tracks in F.H, near Save point and 'Regen' draw point
Galbadia: Galbadia Hotel
Trabia: Shumi Tribe Village Inn
Far Away: Lunar Gate (she won't give a clue to her next destination
                      if she leaves from here; you'll have to find
                      her yourself)

Anyway, keep challenging her until she moves to Dollet. Talk to her
there using the 'X' (U.S) or 'Circle' (Japanese) button, and ask about
her artist father (4th option). The Card Queen will then ask you for
one of your specific rare cards, which you must then lose to her
deliberately in Card Battle.

However, since Dollet has the 'Random' rule, losing the specific card
to the Card Queen might prove difficult. You might want to abolish it.
First, play a game in a region with a few simple rules, but lacking the
'Random' rule (i.e. Timber). Make sure that region also has a rule
which Dollet lacks. Proceed to Dollet, but save before you challenge
anyone here.

He or she will suggest combining rules; accept the challenge by saying
'Yes', but choose to 'Quit' instead of 'Play'. If the 'Random' rule
gets abolished, then you can continue in your quest. If another rule
gets added or abolished, then reset your game, and try again. If
nothing happens, challenge the person again. Alternatively, you can
modify all of your lower level cards, but I think that's kind of a
waste.

Each specified rare card lost to the Card Queen results in another
new rare card created (you can lose the specified rare card to her
anywhere after she's asked for it). However, you can regain your rare
cards which you lost on purpose by challenging the little boy living
with his artist grandpa, further down the road from the Pub in Dollet.

Any other cards lost can be won back from the Card Queen herself. As
for the locations of the newly created rare cards, I'll detail them a
bit further below.

After losing a rare card the Card Queen wanted, she'll move around the
world. You must pursue her until she returns to Dollet, upon which
she'll ask you for another rare card. This happens a total of 5 times;
thus, 5 new cards would have been created. These 5 cards however, must
be won from the people below. You must lose the specified rare card
to the Card Queen first before they'll hold the new card: 

{Kiros}
Lost Card: MiniMog
Win: Man in black at Deling City's shopping arcade

{Irvine}
Lost Card: Sacred
Win: Mayor Dobe's wife Flo, in F.H

{Chubby Chocobo}
Lost Card: Chicobo
Win: Student sitting outside Balamb Garden's Library

{Doomtrain}
Lost Card: Alexander
Win: Owner of Aphora Pub in Timber

{Phoenix}
Lost Card: Doomtrain
Win: President's Assistant in Esthar City's Presidential Palace room.

This quest might get tedious, so I advise you save often. The soft
reset option (pause the game, then press R1+R2+L1+L2+Select+Start)
helps too if you don't like the location the Card Queen's moving to.
If you're lucky, she'll just end up shuttling between Balamb City
and Dollet, which makes your job much easier. Needless to say, this
quest is only for the Card Battle fanatic ^_^

{Preparations}

You're almost up to the end dungeon here, which may require you to
have at least 4 of your characters junctioned *at all times* with G.Fs.
You'll want to do a bit of tweaking here to make sure your G.Fs are
evenly spread out, and that your characters are finely balanced in
terms of capability.

Okay, maybe you can survive with 3 junctioned characters. It's really
up to you to decide (read the section on Ultimecia's Castle in Disc
Four to find out more), but I advise you at least have 4 well
-junctioned members.

Purchase a few 'Amnesia Greens' from a Pet Store, and below are a few
tips I've put together to get you started. Make sure you've learnt
G.F Tonberry's 'Familiar' menu ability, Quezacotl's 'Card Mod.' menu
ability, and have plenty of Gil to spare. Saving beforehand helps too!

1. You'll want everyone to at least have spells junctioned to the 5 
   basic parameters: HP, Strength, Vitality, Magic and Spirit. 
   Buy these G.F. items from the Pet Store (Rin Rin's Shop) in Esthar. 
   Below are my recommendations for the type of spell to junction to 
   each parameter:
   HP: Full-life
   Strength: Ultima, Meteor or Aura
   Vitality: Meltdown
   Magic: Ultima, Triple or Pain
   Spirit: Reflect
   Where you choose to put 'Ultima' is entirely up to the type of 
   character you want to build: an attacker or a magic user. Of the 8 
   spells mentioned above, 3 of them won't be found on the Heaven and 
   Hell Islands. Here's how to get them:
   Meltdown: Draw from level 30 and above Gaylas in the Trabia region.
   Pain: Defeated lv. 20-29 Creeps in the sewers of Deling City drop 
         Curse Spikes; use Diablos' 'Status Magic Refinement' menu
         ability to get 'Pain' spells. Level 30 and above Forbiddens
         in the Centra Ruins also drop Curse Spikes.
   Reflect: Draw from level 30 and above Death Claws in the Centra
            forests, or use Leviathan's 'Support Magic Refinement' to
            refine a Dragon Skin (dropped by level 30 and above
            Anacondaurs in Roshfall Forest) for 20 'Reflect' spells. 
   Use Tonberry's 'Level Up' or 'Level Down' command to assist you.
   
2. Different G.Fs offer varying degrees of protection from Elemental 
   and Status spells, so try to divide these equally among your party. 
   Cards like Selphie's and Doomtrain's, when modified give you items 
   which allow you to add to the G.Fs' Elemental and Status Defense 
   properties, so make use of them.

3. Following that should be character abilities and G.F abilities such 
   as 'Strength +60%' or 'G.F HP +40%'. Let's start with G.Fs first. 
   Items such as Energy Crystals and Samantha's Soul (modify Quistis' 
   card) give pretty decent 'Summon Magic +?' bonuses (30% and 40% 
   respectively). Note that all G.F. abilities are cumulative.
   However, items which give decent 'G.F HP+?' bonuses are rare. I can 
   only recommend modifying Seifer's card to get 3 Diamond Armours 
   (G.F HP +40%).
   Character abilities are another matter altogether. The stores in 
   Esthar sell such items, i.e. Giant Rings (HP+40%) and Power Wrists
   (Strength+40%). Refining 10 of each via Eden's 'G.F Ability Med. 
   Refinement' gives you an upgraded version, i.e. 10 Giant Rings grant 
   you one Gaea's Ring (HP+80%). However, it might prove to be too 
   costly to actually buy them, so there's always cards to fall back 
   on. You can modify Ward's, Edea's, Zell's and Rinoa's cards for such 
   pricey items. Adamantine (Vitality+60%) can be gotten rather easily 
   however; defeat the Adamantoise on Long Horn Island's coasts 
   (north-west of Dollet) for them to drop the items. You can also
   modify G.F Minotaur's card for 10 Adamantines.

4. Items which increase your other parameters such as Speed or Luck
   are quite rare; I believe you won't pick up more than 5 of them
   on your journeys. Still, Irvine's card is one of the rare ones
   which grant you 'Speed +40%'.

5. Rosetta Stones give you 'Ability x4' junction abilities. Again, 
   these are very very rare.
   G.Fs which offer 'Ability x3' or 'Ability x4' include Diablos, 
   Carbuncle, Cerberus, Alexander and Bahamut, so you'll have to 
   modify one other G.F's list of abilities to include 'Ability x4' 
   for the sixth party member if you so wish.

6. There're a variety of ways to actually get the rarer bonus ability 
   items, but such methods are usually very time-consuming and pricey, 
   i.e. 50 Barriers for an Aegis Amulet which lets you junction spells
   to your Evasion parameter. Nonetheless, there're always a few 
   exceptions -- a modified Kiros card gives you 3 Accelerators, 
   which in turn grants you 3 'Auto Haste' character abilities.

7. Try toying around with the refinement system. You may come across 
   more excellent deals which I didn't cover.

8. Here's how my party eventually ended up:
   Squall: Brothers, Carbuncle, Bahamut, Cactuar
   Quistis: Quezacotl, Siren, Alexander, Eden
   Zell: Shiva, Diablos, Doomtrain
   Irvine: Ifrit, Pandemona, Cerberus
   These 4 have the best limit breaks, in my opinion. Teaming both
   Pandemona and Cerberus (Irvine) isn't exactly recommended, but I
   had enough 'Spd-J Scrolls' to spare on the rest.
   Rinoa: Leviathan
   Selphie: Tonberry
   I mainly use Rinoa and Selphie for healing purposes, so it helps
   if they have the 'Draw', 'Recover' or 'Item' commands. You'll have
   to do some modifications for Tonberry to include Junction abilities
   for Selphie, in this case.

Of course, do take note the above is just for the end dungeon. You 
won't be needing that for your next destination, the Pandora, but 
since both places are linked, I suggest you do the fine-tunings now to 
save yourself the hassle later.

Other final preparations include stocking up on items (refine as many 
Power Wrists to Aura Stones as possible) and spells (Heaven and Hell 
Islands), and learning the more useful G.F. abilities such as
Tonberry's 'Call Shop' and Diablos' 'Encounter None'.

<!> Tip:
If you've been relying too much on your G.Fs for offensive measures,
now's the time to start using your characters to dish out the heavy
damage. Take my word for it... or the upcoming bosses will make life
VERY difficult ^_^

Also, take note that in Disc Four ALL towns are in-accessible, so you 
might want to make a separate save file just in case you missed 
anything. And mind you, Disc Four is closer than you think; right after 
the Pandora, in fact.

########################################################################
5o. [Re-entering Lunatic Pandora]
########################################################################

In any case, pilot the Ragnarok over to Tears' Point in the south-east
of Esthar when you feel you're ready. Note that you have to actually
bash into the Pandora using your air-ship to trigger the upcoming set
of events.

<!> Tip:
I get questions asking why nothing happens when they pilot the Ragnarok
towards the Pandora. You must have missed out on a few compulsory
events; saved Rinoa yet? Visited Edea yet? Met the Esthar President
in Esthar and then in the Ragnarok already? If not, complete those
events first.

########################################################################
5p. [Final Lunatic Pandora]

Enemies: Behemoth, Imp, Iron Giant, Torama, Turtapod
Draw Points: Curaga, Meteor, Holy, Silence, Confuse, Ultima
Blue Magic: Mighty Guard, Homing Laser
########################################################################

You can talk to Selphie (or whoever's at the controls) to leave the 
Pandora after the FMV. If you're ready, take the elevator at the back,
then head for the Entrance to get out of the Ragnarok. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS: Raijin  HP: 22,200  Weak: Poison  Strong vs.: Thunder
              Draw List: Thundara, Thundaga, Shell, Protect
BOSS: Fujin  HP: 17,900  Weak: Poison  Strong vs.: Wind
             Draw List: Aero, Curaga, Full-life, Tornado
             Total AP: 20

Cast 'Blind' on Raijin to halt his physical attacks, then dispose of 
him using Squall's Renzokuken. Fujin likes to use support magic such 
as 'Haste' on herself, so break it using 'Dispell'. Watch out too for 
her 'Sai' (Shatter), which reduces a single member's HP to 1. You can
off her with Squall's limit break rather easily. Eden, Doomtrain and
Diablos work fine too.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Follow the 2 into the interior of the Pandora. In the next screen, head 
up before taking a left. You'll come across two old friends -- Biggs 
and Wedge, but they won't attack you. Save at the point nearby.

The next area of the Pandora should be very familiar to you; you were 
here when you hopped aboard the Pandora in Esthar. The valuable draw 
points such as 'Meteor' and 'Holy' are still there, so take time off to 
pick them up. Head for the green 01 elevator.

Side events: All enemies encountered in the Pandora are at level 1.
Try mugging the Behemoth for a 'Barrier' if you have yet to do so. It
lets Quistis learn her 'Mighty Guard'.

You should find a save point after a short walk from the lift. Make 
your preparations here and save before heading north. The Pandora 
offers nothing else; you should have picked up everything the last 
time you were here. If not, try referring back to the earlier Lunatic
Pandora invasion event in Esthar for a list of the items here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS: Mobile Type 8 BIS  HP: 46,000  Weak: Thunder
                         Draw List: Firaga, Thundaga, Blizzaga, Flare   
SUB-BOSS: Right Probe  HP: 9,000  Weak: Thunder
                       Draw List: Curaga, Demi
SUB-BOSS: Left Probe  HP: 9,000  Weak: Thunder
                      Draw List: Curaga, Esuna
                      Total AP: 40

When it switches to 'Mobile Weaponary Attack Mode', it'll retaliate
against all physical attacks aimed at the main body, so keep to using
Thundaga spells, Quezacotl and Eden during this period to damage it.

After it changes to 'Support Weaponary Attack Mode' it'll launch its
'Corona', which decreases everyone's HP to one, so have a member cast
'Cerberus' at the start to put the party in 'Triple' status; this
enables a single person to heal everyone with Curaga. Or you could use
a Megalixir (modify Bahamut's card). Just do it quick, or the upcoming
'Megido Flame' will wipe out your weakened party.

You can also damage it with the tried-and-tested combo of Meltdown
-Aura-Renzokuken to take the bugger down easily. Junction 'Thundaga'
to Elemental Attack for best results.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

<!> <!>  T I P  <!> <!>:
You're almost up to a point in the game in which there's no turning
back. Head back a screen to save first; I highly recommend you make a
separate save file at this point. You MUST at least have a 'Meltdown'
spell here. If not, head back outside to the Overworld, and engage
level 30 and above Gaylas on the Trabia continent in combat; draw
'Meltdown' from them.

Proceed onwards to meet up with Seifer. He'll dismiss both Raijin and
Fujin when they try to talk some sense into him, and attack Squall.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS: Seifer  HP: 34,500  Weak: Poison  
              Draw List: Firaga, Thundaga, Blizzaga, Aura  AP: 40

Start off by drawing a few 'Aura' spells from Seifer. If his physical 
prowess is giving you trouble, cast 'Protect' on yourselves. Seifer 
will begin to use his 'Bloodfest' when his HPs get low, which hits 
for a pretty significant amount of damage, so watch out for it. You 
can dispatch him too easily with a single Meltdown-Aura-Renzokuken 
combination though.

As always, make sure to plunder either a 'Hero' or a 'Holy War' from
Seifer. If you have Odin, this battle will be the last you see of him.
He'll be replaced by a much more versatile Gilgamesh at the end of the
fight.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just a bit of information on Gilgamesh... he can appear anytime in a 
battle (unlike Odin who appears only at the start of a confrontation). 
When he does he'll unleash one of four possible attacks:

Zantetsuken (Slashing Steel Blade): Similar to Odin's attack.
Masamune: A sword swipe to all enemies for a heavy sum of damage.
Excaliber: A sword swipe to all enemies for a moderate sum of damage.
Excalipoor: A sword swipe to all enemies for 1 HP of damage ^_^

Seifer will take Rinoa away after the battle, but you'll still want to 
keep Rinoa's HP, Vitality and Spirit parameters high. You'll see why
later. In any case, junction Quistis (or whoever replaces Rinoa)
thereafter. Leave the room.

Draw Points: Break

If you observe carefully, you'll notice a structure to the right, which
leads to the upper regions of the Pandora in the next screen. Ascend
the first ladder, then climb the next ladder for a 'Break' draw point.
Descend, then proceed left to run up the tilting white pole.
 
Take a right when you reach the top, then head into the opening in the
next screen. There'll be an invisible save point along the way; use
Siren's 'Move-Find' party ability to see it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS: Adel  HP: 50,000+  Draw List: Firaga, Thundaga, Blizzaga, Flare
ALLY: Rinoa  HP: Variable  Draw List: Esuna, Dispell, Regen
             Total AP: 0

You'll have two targets to choose from here, and you MUST NOT let Rinoa 
die in this battle. Adel has quite a formidable arsenal of magical 
attacks, and occasionally she'll drain Rinoa's HPs. Counter this by 
junctioning spells to Rinoa's HP parameter prior to this, and casting 
Regen on her at the start of the fight.

You can't use spells such as Ultima, Squall's Renzokuken or any G.Fs 
here as they'll also damage Rinoa, so stick to physical attacks on 
Adel. A 'Meltdown' spell on her before that should make your task
easier. Heal Rinoa when needed.

Limit breaks which work here include Zell's 'Duel' and Irvine's 'Shot'.
Just make sure you don't accidentally trigger any of their 'hit all
targets' attacks.

Side note: Actually, I had no idea about the Renzokuken damaging Rinoa, 
and sorta used it on Adel. Strangely enough, even though the finishing 
blow (Blasting Zone) did 9,999 damage to both Adel and Rinoa, I didn't 
get a Game Over. I took Adel down with this move though. Apparently, as
long as Adel is defeated, the game doesn't bother to check if Rinoa's
still alive. This method's a bit risky, though.

This is where I get the majority of mails from befuddled gamers com
-plaining about why Squall does only 400+ damage to Adel with a
physical attack; try reading the Menu Tutorial section carefully...
the Junction System is really vital to survival in FF VIII.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

########################################################################
6b. [Commencement Room]
########################################################################

Ellone will initiate time compression here... after a nice FMV you'll 
find yourselves in the Commencement Room. Save, then trudge your way 
through the numerous save points that appear. Head for the door in the 
background.

Squall and company will have to combat the sorceress of each era, and
every fight takes place on a different battlefield, cumulating in a 
show-down with the final Sorceress.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSSES: Sorceress A x6  HP: 3,390  Draw List: Firaga, Thundaga, Blizzaga
BOSSES: Sorceress B x5  HP: 4,496  Draw List: Haste, Double
                        Total AP: 0

The battles are continuous here, but fortunately these sorceresses are 
quite easy to take down. Both physical attacks and spells which affect 
all targets (i.e. Ultima, Meteor) should allow you to breeze through 
them.

BOSS: Sorceress C  HP: 50,000+  Draw List: Flare, Holy  AP: 55

She can hit you pretty hard in a single counter-attack, which takes
away roughly 1,000 HPs from one character. Also, when she finishes
her count-down, she'll unleash 'Ultima' on your party, something
which you won't want. In any case, hit her with a Meltdown-Aura
-Renzokuken combo, and have the remaining cast heal or summon powerful
G.Fs such as Bahamut and Eden.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Edea's Orphanage]
Head up, take a right, then proceed up again for a cool FMV introducing 
Ultimecia's Castle. Make your way north still, and along the way you 
should come across a thick metal chain. There should be a total of 3 
doors to the left; press 'X' (U.S) or 'Circle' (Japanese) near them to
leap towards them. Just head for the portal to the upper-left or the
one in the middle to get out first. Here's where they lead to:

Upper-left portal: Region near the Chocobo Sanctuary
                   (Coastal area of Grandidi Forest)
Middle-left portal: Region near the Centra Ruins
                    (Serengetti Plains)
Lower-left portal: Region near Deling City
                   (Wilburn Hill) 

#######################################################################
6c. [Time-Compressed Overworld] (note: Although optional, I highly
                                       recommend you at least recover
                                       the Ragnarok)
#######################################################################

Depending on which portal you chose in the previous section, you'll
be able to access the Ragnarok in 2 different ways. I'll detail the
portal which leads to the region near the Chocobo Sanctuary first:

You'll emerge at the shoreline near the Chocobo Sanctuary (the forested
cliffs north-east of Esthar). Head inland and locate the camouflaged
dome-like Sanctuary, which should be in the north of Grandidi Forest.
Make sure you equip Diablos' 'Encounter None' party ability while
searching for the Chocobo Sanctuary; the enemies here can get annoying.

Once you've got that free chocobo, ride it south along the eastern
coasts of the Esthar continent, then across the shallow waters at the
southern tips of the continent towards Kashkabald Desert.

There's a beach south-east of the desert; get your Chocobo onto the
Centra continent via the shore, and head towards the center of the
desert to find the Ragnarok. The air-ship appears as a red dot on your
world map, btw.

And here's the alternate way to get to the Ragnarok, if you chose the
middle portal previously:

You'll emerge on the Centra continent, somewhere near the Centra Ruins.
Head north-west, and keep a lookout for a mountain wrapped around a
Chocobo Forest on the north-east tip of this island. Enter the forest,
get a Chocobo (or pay the Chocoboy 1,200 gil to ride one), then ride
the Chocobo south.

You'll eventually find a beach; cross the shallow waters to get to the
opposite island (Edea's Orphanage should be nearby). Head north-east
from here, through a narrow pass in a mountain range to reach
Kashkabald Desert and the Ragnarok. The air-ship appears as a red dot
on the world map, btw.

You'll notice that with the exception of dungeons and chocobo forests, 
all other areas are blocked off. There's not much you can do about the 
strange barriers surrounding each town, so don't bother about them too 
much. 

Still, I suggest you take a trip down to the Heaven and Hell Islands to 
stock up on spells first. Once you've done that, try taking a look 
inside the Ragnarok.

#######################################################################
6d. [Ragnarok Revisited]

Rare Cards: All
#######################################################################

Here's where you can complete your collection of rare cards, as well as 
purchase supplies. You must have defeated CC Group's King at Balamb
Garden previously, either in Disc Two or Three.

You should meet up with Xu at the Entrance of the ship. And as for the
rest of the CC Group, they're scattered all over the Ragnarok, but
shouldn't pose a problem in locating them. Note that the Joker near
the elevator sells you items, in addition to providing weapon
remodeling services.

To play King, put 'him' in your main party, then talk to 'him' using
'Square' while in the Air Room of the Ragnarok. Each CC Group member
plays accordingly to a certain region's rules.

Jack: Aisle, near Entrance (Balamb's rules)
Club: Aisle, near Air Room (Dollet's rules)
Diamond: Hangar (Trabia's rules)
Spade: Hangar, near save point (Esthar's rules)
Heart: Entrance (F.H's rules)
King: Air Room (Lunar Base's rules)
Joker: Aisle, near Passenger Deck (Centra's rules)

The CC Group holds virtually all the rare cards (except for those
exclusive to the Card Queen Quest) you've yet to collect, so take time
off to win them. However, they won't be your only source of rare cards
in Disc Four, as the Card Queen can still be found on the Overworld
itself.

She's located at one of the southern tips of the Esthar continent, in
the Abadan Plains. You can't see her on the Overworld directly; you'll
need to actually run into the specific area to enter a field screen.
Btw, this is the same field screen where you re-discovered Piet and
the crashed escape pod in Disc Three. She holds the 5 cards exclusive
to the Card Queen Quest.

[Returning to Ultimecia's Castle]
When you're ready, fly over to Kashkabald Desert and look for a portal 
in the north-west. This opens up yet another door to the right of the 
metal chain leading to Ultimecia's Castle. Run up from there to reach 
the final dungeon of FF VIII. Save before you enter.

#######################################################################
6e. [Ultimecia's Castle]

Enemies: All
Draw Points: Meteor, Slow, Dispel, Ultima, Holy, Cura, Curaga,
             Full-life, Aura, Meltdown, Triple, Stop
G.Fs: Siren (Tri-Point), Carbuncle (Krysta), Leviathan (Trauma), 
      Pandemona (Red Giant), Cerberus (Gargantua), Alexander
      (Catoblepas), Eden (Tiamat)
Weapons: Omega ^_^
#######################################################################

Upon your entrance, Squall will have 8 commands sealed off: Item, Magic,
G.F, Draw, Command Abilities, Limit Breaks, Resurrection and Save. This
handicap is temporary; you can either leave the castle to get back your
abilities, or defeat the 8 bosses hidden within the dungeon to reclaim
them.

In addition, you have to work in 2 parties here. Here're my 
recommendations:

Main Party: Squall, Rinoa, Zell
Secondary Party: Quistis, Selphie, Irvine

Here's where you have to divide and junction G.Fs evenly among your 
party members. I used Diablos' 'Encounter None' party ability most of
the time here, so you may have to exchange Diablos each time you change
parties, via the 'Junction Exchange' option in the menu screen, under
the 'Switch' command (U.S version only).

Throughout the castle you'll find spinning green Switch Spots. Stepping 
onto them produces 3 options:
- Switch to the other party.
- Change party members (both parties must be standing at the same
  Switch Spot).
- Cancel.  
Now that you have a rough idea of what's going on, it's time to start:
(walkthrough of Ultimecia's Castle and all bosses stats - with the 
 exception of Ultimecia's - courtesy of Scott Ong's Final Fantasy VIII
 FAQ Part I)

Main Party: You should start in the Hall. Head north and climb the
            stairs to face Sphinxaur.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS: Sphinxaur  HP: 12,000+  Draw List: Firaga, Thundaga, Blizzaga
                 AP: 30

Since you'll only have the 'Attack' command available here, make sure 
your party is properly junctioned when it comes to their HP and Strength
parameter. Just beat on Sphinxaur using physical attacks (Squall's R1 
Gunblade trigger comes into play here), and ignore the monsters he 
summons. Junctioning 'Blizzaga' to Elemental Defense may help to absorb
the damage if Sphinxaur decides to cast Ice magic.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Choose to unlock 'Magic' after the fight. Remember to add this command 
to your command list immediately in the menu screen! Magic lets you 
heal your characters, plus you now have access to (hopefully) various 
powerful spells that you've stocked up.

<!> Tip: (U.S version only!)
If you've missed out on any of the G.Fs listed in the area information
section above, choose to unlock 'Draw' instead. The remaining 7 bosses
carry the G.Fs in their draw list. Then, be very careful of the
abilities you unlock next; I suggest Magic, Limit Breaks, G.F,
Resurrection, then Command Abilities, in that order. I've left out Save
and Items, seeing how you could always run out of the Castle to save
after every boss fight (take note of your previous location first),
and healing can be achieved via Magic.

Main Party: Head up the stairs. Ignore the door in front of you and
            make your way right instead. Go through the door in the
            south-east.

            In the Eastern Stairway Hall of the castle, run to your
            right and descend the stairs. You should see a string
            attached to a bell at the foot of the stairs. Ringing it
            with the 'X' (U.S) or 'Circle' (Japanese) button produces
            a timer in the top-left corner of the screen, but you won't
            be needing that now. Just keep the location of this bell
            in mind. Proceed through the door in the background, past
            the green Switch Spot.

            You should be in the Art Gallery now. First, take a
            look at each of the 4 paintings on the 1st floor of the 
            Gallery (ignore the largest one to the left), then climb
            the steps to the right. View the other 8 paintings on the
            2nd Floor (there's a 'Shell' Draw Point here, btw). Btw,
            it's imperative you examine ALL 12 paintings. Here are
            their titles:

            Ignus (Fire)               Inandantia (Flood)
            Iudicium (Judgement)       Intervigilium (Sleep)
            Vigil (Watchman)           Vividarium (Garden)
            Viator (Messenger)         Venus (Love)
            Xiphias (Swordfish)        Xerampelinae (Red Clothes)
            Xystus (Tree-lined Road)   Inaudax (Cowardice)

            Now return to the large painting to the left on the 1st 
            floor, the one which I told you to ignore previously. 
            Examine it and enter 'Vividarium', 'Intervigilium' and
            'Viator', in that order. Trauma should appear now.

            To solve the puzzle... try going up to the 2nd floor of
            the Art Gallery. You'll see a clock painted onto the
            floor below; take note of the numbers the hands point to:
            VIII, IIII, VI. The 'V' indicates you should select only
            titles beginning with 'V', while the following 'I's give
            you the exact number of 'I's in each correct title.

            So 'VIII' would represent 'VIvIdarIum', 'IIII' would
            represent 'IntervIgIlIum' and 'VI' represents 'VIator'.
            These are read in the order of hour, minute and second.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS: Trauma  HP: 28,809  Weak: Wind  Draw List: Flare, Leviathan
SUB-BOSS: Drama  HP: 2,518  Weak: Wind  Draw List: Esuna, Dispell
                 Total AP: 30

Cast 'Meltdown' on Trauma, then bash away at him using physical attacks. 
You can also use 'Tornado' coupled with 'Triple' to do damage, but I 
advise you ignore the Dramas he summons; they come in unlimited numbers.
Junction 'Tornado' to Elemental Attack if you can, and be wary of
Trauma's 'Mega Pulse Cannon'. It isn't pretty when it hits.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Choose to unlock 'Limit Breaks' here (that is, if you've already
un-sealed 'Magic' previously). You're pretty much a powerhouse now with
Squall's Renzokuken usable. Proceed into the background and step through
the door. Further up ahead you'll find a Switch Spot. Now take over
your secondary party.

Secondary Party: Equip Diablos over to the party members here for his 
                 'Encounter None' ability if you wish to. Head up the 
                 stairs and into the door in the north. Run onto the 
                 chandelier; it should fall, and you'll wind up in the
                 Grand Hall. Examine the nearby hatch in the floor to
                 descend into the Wine Cellar. Tri-Point awaits.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS: Tri-Point  HP: 22,000  Weak: Fire OR Ice  Strong vs.: Thunder
                 Draw List: Haste, Tornado, Bio, Siren  AP: 30

Tri-Point counters with a very damaging Mega Spark each time you attack
it (takes off about 3,000 HP from everyone), so make sure you junction 
'Thundaga' to Elemental Defense before the fight. Then just hit it with 
'Firaga', 'Blizzaga' (Tri-Point changes its weakness) or physical
attacks (cast 'Meltdown' and junction 'Firaga' or 'Blizzaga' to
Elemental Attack) for an easy victory.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release the seal on 'G.F' or 'Save' here. If you have yet to unseal
'Limit Breaks', choose that in favour of 'G.F' or 'Save'.

Climb back up to the Grand Hall, and head through the door in the
background to reach a Switch Spot in the Courtyard. Change over to your
main party.

Main Party: If you chose to unlock 'Save' after felling Tri-Point, you
            can climb the stairs to the left and head through the left
            opening to reach a save point at the end of the corridor.
            Otherwise, just go through the door in front of the Switch
            Spot to reach the Floodgate (remember to swap Diablos over).

            Go for the door to the left in the basement. It should shut
            behind you. Take the key from the skeleton's hand.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS: Red Giant  HP: 30,000  Strong vs.: Physical attacks
                 Draw List: Demi, Pandemona  AP: 30

This guy has a ridiculously high defense, but that's easily countered 
by casting 'Meltdown' on him and whacking him with a Renzokuken. Also, 
summoning Diablos, Cactuar and Doomtrain work well, in addition to
casting 'Demi'. Other than the above 4 methods, there's no other way
you can hurt him. Try using 'Blind' on him, too.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Choose to unlock either 'G.F' or 'Save' here, depending on which you
have yet to release. Return back to the Switch Spot leading to the
Floodgate (you can save if you want to beforehand at the save point
mentioned above). Change your party.

Secondary Party: You should be at the Courtyard. Head for the door in
                 the background (ignore the path leading to the right).

                 The Chapel offers a playable organ in the upper-left
                 corner. You can bang on it all you want first, but
                 remember its position. Climb the staircase to the 
                 right of the screen. Eventually you'll reach a wooden
                 bridge. Notice a sparkling object on it? WALK towards
                 it to pick it up. Now return to the Switch Spot in the
                 Courtyard. If the key appears to fall off, don't fret;
                 you haven't lost it.

Main Party: Go back into the Floodgate again. Examine the canal to the
            right of the screen to pick up the Armoury Key. If you
            managed to pick up the key without it falling off the
            bridge earlier, then just use it on the door to the right
            and enter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS: Gargantua (Head)  HP: 10,626  Weak: Holy  
                        Draw List: Esuna, Haste, Bio
BOSS: Gargantua (Left Hand)  HP: 6,884  Weak: Holy  
                             Draw List: Shell, Protect
BOSS: Gargantua (Right Hand)  HP: 6,884  Weak: Holy
                              Draw List: Bio, Demi, Quake, Regen

Summon 'Siren' to halt their magical spells, then follow up with 
'Alexander' to take them out. You can cast 'Holy' on them if you want.
The full version of Gargantua will appear after you defeat the 3 parts.

BOSS: Gargantua (Whole)  HP: 15,000  
                         Draw List: Bio, Quake, Reflect, Cerberus
                         Total AP: 42

He likes to cast various status maladies, so make sure your party 
members are properly junctioned for Status Defense. Junction Berserk,
Blind and Slow in this case for ST-Def.

Take him out with a Doomtrain-Aura-Renzokuken combination, and remember
to heal when needed. Hitting him with a physical attack results in a
'Counter Twist' by Gargantua (takes off 2,000+ HP), so cast spells or
summon G.Fs such as Alexander, Bahamut, Cactuar or Eden.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hey, notice the green blood dripping from the sword on the wall here?
It was coloured red in the Japanese version ^_^

Remove the seal on 'Items' or 'Resurrection'. Now return to the Switch
Spot outside the Dungeon (save if you want to first).

<!> Tip:
For the upcoming section to play out correctly, your main party has to
consist of more males than females, and vice versa for your secondary
party. It's okay if you followed my recommendations for both parties
straight from the start.

Secondary Party: From the Courtyard, head back one screen, move left
                 towards a door, transverse the corridor and step
                 through the door at the end of it to get back to the
                 Hall. Climb the stairs again, but this time head left 
                 towards another door to reach the Western Stairway Hall.

                 Descend the stairs to the left, head past the Switch
                 Spot into the door, and keep moving into the 
                 background in the next screen. Take the left Switch
                 Spot at the Elevator Hall.

Main Party: Starting from outside the Floodgate, climb the stairs to
            the left, into the left opening and past the save point.
            Step onto the elevator and switch over to the other party.

Secondary Party: You'll be elevated to the 2nd floor. Proceed left into
                 a Storage Room. Check around to find a 'Floodgate
                 Key'. Return back to the elevator and switch.

Main Party: Head all the way back to the Floodgate. There should be a
            switch next to the door on the left. Have Squall examine it
            twice to drain the water. Now head for the Courtyard and
            look for a sparkling object in the fountain. Pick up the
            'Treasure Vault Key'. Go back into the Grand Hall and
            step onto the Switch Spot to the right. This prevents the 
            chandelier above from falling temporarily. Switch.

Side events: Before you return to the Grand Hall, try heading into 
(Main Party) the Chapel. At the organ, press all 8 keys simultaneously.
             Now back-track to the Courtyard and take the right
             path. A new route (previously blocked by a steel gate)
             should've been opened up; follow the one-way trail. At
             the end of the Waterway you'll find a Rosetta Stone, plus
             open up a shortcut to the Floodgate.

             If the steel gate is still there, try re-playing the
             organ. You must hold down all 8 buttons until the notes
             fade away.

Secondary Party: From the Elevator Hall, head back a screen to the
                 dark corridor. Look for a door to the left (which is
                 partially hidden). It's somewhere down the middle
                 stretch, behind a pillar.

                 Inside the Treasure Vault will be 4 coffins. Just open
                 all of them up to get Catoblepas to appear.

<!> Tip:
To open all the coffins, start by closing the leftmost one, then the
rightmost coffin, followed by the 2nd-to-left coffin. Finally, open the
2nd-to-right coffin.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS: Catoblepas  HP: 31,500  Weak: Earth, Water  Strong vs.: Thunder
                  Draw List: Meteor, Alexander  AP: 30

Summon G.F. Brothers or Leviathan to do damage (or junction either 
'Quake' or 'Water' to Elemental Attack). The Doomtrain-Aura-Shot
(Irvine's limit break) combination works nicely too. His attacks consist
of mainly single-target spells like Thundaga, so don't worry too much.
Draw a few 'Meteor' spells if you can, but beware Catoblepas' final
attack: a Meteor spell.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unlock either 'Item' or 'Resurrection' (depends on your previous
selection after downing the Gargantua). Now head back to the Hall,
through the door to the north, over the now stable chandelier and into
the door over at the other end. Krysta awaits at the Terrace.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS: Krysta  HP: 12,000  Strong vs.: Ice  Draw List: Holy, Carbuncle
              AP: 30

Krysta has a few pretty nasty moves, and has the ability to counter
every attack you throw at it, with the exception of summoned G.Fs. Just
use a (you guessed it) Doomtrain-Aura-Shot combo to take care of it.
Krysta will cast 'Ultima' as a last resort after you finish it off, so
keep your HPs high towards the end of the fight.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

You'll have only 'Draw' and 'Command Abilities' left unlocked. I suggest
taking the latter. You won't be needing the 'Draw' command much here
anyway (assuming you didn't miss any G.Fs in your quest). Besides,
commands such as 'Level Down', 'Recover' and 'Revive' will come in
useful. Return to the Switch Spot in the Hall.

Main Party: Proceed into the Chapel, and head up the right staircase. 
            Cross the wooden bridge and enter the door to the left. The
            ladder to the right leads to a dead-end, btw.

            On the very 1st floor of the Clock Tower should be an
            invisible save point (use Siren's 'Move-Find' party
            ability to see it). Climb up the extensive winding path
            until you reach a swinging bell.

            Position yourselves at the edge opposite to the lone ledge
            the bell swings to, and press the 'X' (U.S) or 'Circle'
            (Japanese) button to jump onto the bell. Enter the opening
            on the ledge to reach the exterior balcony of the Clock
            Tower... and your most powerful adversary thus far in
            Ultimecia's Castle.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS: Tiamat  HP: 89,800  Strong vs.: Fire, Thunder, Wind
              Draw List: Flare, Eden  AP: 30

Tiamat has an above average magic defense parameter, and his 'Dark
Flare' does a pretty hefty amount of damage (about 4,000+ if you're 
properly junctioned) to everyone. Try to minimise this by casting 
'Shell' at the start of the fight, then quickly attack him using a 
Doomtrain-Aura-Renzokuken combination.

You probably need to have Squall unleash his limit break twice to
actually take Tiamat down. Likewise, if you do it fast enough, Tiamat
won't get a chance to pull his 'Dark Flare' off, so you might want to
have Squall equipped with a high offensive and speed rating. Cerberus'
'Auto Haste' character ability works well here. You can also slow
down Tiamat by summoning G.F Doomtrain.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unseal your final command here, and you're left with only the last boss
to face. Head back into the Clock Tower, leap onto the bell, then travel
up the remaining winding path to the top. When the path splits, go up
for a 'Stop' Draw Point, then head south.

Main Party (still): Run across the hands of the clock face, climb down
                    the ladder and move right to reach another ladder,
                    which you'll have to descend using. The bridge
                    thereafter leads to Ultimecia's Room. Save at the
                    save point outside, recover all 6 of your
                    characters, stock up on supplies (Tonberry's 'Call
                    Shop' ability comes into play here) and do a final
                    check on your junctioning and spells. Enter
                    Ultimecia's Room when you're ready. 

Side events: Ultimecia's Castle holds virtually all the enemies (even
some old bosses!) you've ever encountered. Try fighting in different
regions of the castle to face all of them, and pick up any rare items
you may have missed.

Another special side event I'll like to highlight here is finding and 
taking down the Omega Weapon. Unlike its cousin, the Ultima Weapon, 
this guy has the ability to kick your butt so hard, it'll be sore for
months to come. So unless you really want to test your skills, I 
suggest you leave him for now, and come back later when you're 
properly prepared. 

For those who feel confident enough, here's what you'll need: 20 Hero's
Medicine (modify Laguna's card) or a few Holy War Medicine (modify
Gilgamesh's card), 'Death' junctioned to Status Defense if anyone in
your main party has a level which is a multiple of 5 (i.e. lv. 65, 70
or 100), a 'Meltdown' spell, 10 Aura Stones (or 'Aura' spells), and a
high offensive-cum-HP rating (255 and 9,999 respectively) for Squall.

That's for the cheap way to defeat him though ^_^ I'll detail the other
traditional method below. Saving before the fight helps too!

First off, take your main party and position them at the Switch Spot in
the Courtyard, outside the Chapel. Have the secondary party make
their way to the Eastern Stairway Hall of the castle, outside the Art
Gallery where the bell is. Ring it once, then quickly step into the
nearby Switch Spot. Proceed into the Chapel as your main party, where
you'll find Omega Weapon waiting for you.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPECIAL BOSS: Omega Weapon  HP: 1,000,000+  Strong vs.: All Elements
                            Draw List: Flare, Holy, Meteor, Ultima
                            AP: 250

The Omega Weapon has several kick-ass attacks at its disposal, some of 
which include the Megido Flame (9,998 damage to everyone), the Light 
Pillar (9,999 damage to a single character) and the all-powerful Terra 
Break, which hits everyone for approximately 12,000 HP worth of damage. 
Fortunately, the Hero's Medicine should render all these attacks 
useless, as it puts a single party member into 'Invincible' status. 
You'll get a 'Proof of Omega' in your Tutorial screen after defeating it.

Cheap method:
Omega will use 'Level 5 Death' at the start, so make sure everyone is
protected from that. Have the party use Hero's Medicine on Rinoa and
Zell, with Squall casting a 'Meltdown' spell on Omega. Your opponent
will hit you with the 'Meteor' spell now, so recover Squall's HPs back
to 9,999 (Leviathan's 'Recover' command works fine here) using a
character. You can let the other cast 'Haste' on Squall if you want,
but leave Squall with a full time bar.

Omega Weapon should launch its Megido Flame now, reducing Squall's HP
to only 1. Have him unleash his Renzokuken, while another party member
uses a Hero's Medicine on him. Now your main task will be to keep
everyone in 'Invincible' status, as Squall repeatedly launches a
flurry of limit break attacks to take Omega Weapon down. You don't
have to bother with the rest of Omega's moves. Should Squall fall in
this battle later on, I suggest using Aura (Stones) on him instead
of waiting for his HP to be reduced back to critical status (after
reviving him 1st with Full-life or Revive, that is).

The 'Other' method:
This is for those who find themselves missing the Hero's Medicine.
You'll need (as many as you can get) G.Fs with a high HP rating (i.e.
Eden), everyone in your main party with maximum HPs (9,999), good
parameter ratings plus a ton of recovery spells and items. I suggest
modifying Bahamut's card to obtain 100 Megalixirs.

Omega always begins a fight with 'Level 5 Death', so ensure full 
protection against that in your party. Summon Cerberus now to put 
everyone in 'Triple' status, then follow this up with a Meltdown-Aura
-Renzokuken combo. Recover everyone's HPs back to 9,999 after Omega's
'Meteor' spell. The Megido Flame should reduce that back to only 1;
heal quickly after unleashing your limit breaks, but watch out for
Omega Weapon's 'Gravija'. Recover your members after that spell hits.

Next, summon G.Fs with high HPs, and let them absorb some of the
damage when Omega uses his Terra Break (12,000+ damage to everyone). 
Unleash your limit breaks if possible; Omega will cast 'Gravija' or
'Ultima', followed by his Light Pillar which WILL take a member now.
Use a 'Full-life' spell to get him or her back, followed by a flurry
of recovery items (a single Megalixir works nicely here) to restore
everyone's HP back to maximum.

Omega will settle into a random pattern of attacks from here on; your
tasks will be to hit him hard with limit breaks while predicting what
he'll try to do next, and curing with a Megalixir when needed. And if
you're lucky, Rinoa's 'Combine' limit break might see Angelo using
'Invincible Moon', which would double as a 'Holy War'. Good luck!
------------------------------------------------------------------------

########################################################################
6f. [Ultimecia's Castle -- Master Room]
########################################################################

Ultimecia will express her fury at SeeD for interfering with her plans
of time compression, before she engages you in combat.

The participants are picked randomly here (and that includes Squall
as well), so make sure your G.Fs are evenly spread out. Ultimecia will
remove fallen companions in battle with her 'Angel' move, but if you're
quick enough you can beat her to it with a well-timed 'Full-life' spell.
Of course, if that fallen member has no G.Fs junctioned, then allow
Ultimecia to remove him or her.

She comes in 5 (well, 4 and a half to be more accurate) forms, which 
you'll need to fight consecutively. You can use Hero's Medicine for a
way too easy victory if you want to (it's the final battle, anyway).

And if you're wanting more Heroes, but lack either Laguna's or
Gilgamesh's card, here's a tedious method of obtaining Heroes:

1. Defeat and collect 10,000 Curse Spikes from Forbiddens at levels 30
   and above (skeletons armed with 2 swords). Seriously.

2. With G.F Siren at level 100, use her 'Tools-RF' to refine 10,000
   Curse Spikes to 100 Shaman Stones.

3. With G.F Doomtrain at level 100, use its 'Forbidden Med-RF' to
   refine 100 Shaman Stones to 10 Hero Trials.

4. Use G.F Alexander's 'Med LV Up' to refine 10 Hero Trials to a single
   Hero.

The profits aren't all that great, so I don't really recommend this
procedure. If you have everyone properly junctioned, then Heroes are
basically optional in the final battle.

Here's a list detailing the specific attack method for each character:

Squall: Have him unleash his Renzokuken (duh).
Rinoa: Her 'Combine' limit break works okay, but keep her primarily as
       a healer of sorts. You can try using 'Angel Wing', but seeing
       how you'll lose control of Rinoa, I advise against it.
Zell: His 'Duel' should be his main offense.
Quistis: Support the party with her 'Mighty Guard' and 'White Wind'
         blue magic. For offense, use 'Shockwave Pulsar' if you
         have it. Otherwise, stick to 'Ray-Bomb' or 'Gatling Gun'.
Irvine: Go trigger-happy with his 'Shot' limit break. His 'Armour
        Piercing Ammo', 'Demolition Ammo' and 'Pulse Ammo' work fine.
        If you're a quick tapper, and have a full stock of 'Fast Ammo',
        try using them against Ultimecia's final form.
Selphie: Her 'Slot' limit break won't help much here, and it isn't
         worth it cycling through the list to try to get the rarer
         spells... make Selphie a healer instead.

It's pretty obvious you need a chunk of Aura (Stones) for this last
battle. However, should Squall be chosen as one of the participants
(this occurs quite frequently, actually), I suggest letting him do all
the attacking instead. The rest should simply support him by casting
'Meltdown' to destroy the enemy's defense, and healing Squall when
needed. Make sure Squall has a Strength rating of 255 and his final
weapon, the Lion Heart.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS: Ultimecia  HP: 43,000  Weak: Poison  Strong vs.: Holy
                 Draw List: Haste, Slow, Reflect, Demi

The 1st form of Ultimecia can be taken down effortlessly with a single 
Meltdown-Aura-Renzokuken combination. However, I suggest you make use of 
this one to prepare for the upcoming battles; put everyone in 'Triple', 
'Protect', 'Shell', 'Haste' and 'Regen' (Quistis' 'Mighty Guard' Blue
Magic comes in handy here), followed by 'Aura' status if possible. 
Ultimecia will attempt to spoil the party with 'Quake' and her 'Mael
-strom' (causes status maladies and heavy HP damage to all), but
counter that with a Megalixir (modify Bahamut's card).

BOSS G.F: Griever  HP: 120,000+  Strong vs.: Earth, Poison
                   Draw List: Bio, Quake, Tornado

Griever has a status ailment attack, tends to cast 'Gravija' and
'Doom', and has an annoying habit of drawing spells from your party.
Counter 'Doom' with either a Remedy Plus or a Megalixir, and hit him
repeatedly with Renzokukens (remember to reduce his defense to zero
with 'Meltdown' 1st). Casting 'Ultima' coupled with 'Triple' works
well too, but I suggest you learn Eden's 'Expendx3-1' character
ability first.

Griever'll occasionally remove an entire set of spells (i.e. a 100
Full-life spells) from your magic list, thus forcing you to lose that
junction (i.e. if you've junctioned Full-life to HP, it'll fall back
to its original value).

Also note that from Griever onwards, the bosses have the ability to 
kill off any of your G.Fs in a single blow, so don't bother with 
summoning them. Griever will use his Shockwave Pulsar at the end (or 
earlier if you aren't quick enough in taking him out), which takes 
off about 3,000 HP from everyone (that's if you have a decent Spirit
rating -- try junctioning 'Reflect' to it and having 'Spirit +60%'
equipped), or 1,500 if you're under a 'Shell' condition.

BOSS: Ultimecia-Griever  HP: 180,000+
                         Draw List: Firaga, Thundaga, Blizzaga
SUB-BOSS: Helix  HP: 25,000+  Draw List: Esuna, Dispell

Ultimecia will junction with Griever for a truly nasty package. This 
3rd form likes to cast 'Tornado', 'Meteor' and 'Holy', plus she'll
occasionally remove an entire set of spells from your magic list too.

She's also capable of casting the Shockwave Pulsar at anytime now. 
Other than that, tiny cronies will appear to help in the duration of
the fight. If you stall for too long until 2 Helixes appear, watch out
for Ultimecia's 'Great Attractor', a (visually stunning) physical
attack which does 4,000+ damage to the entire party.

Stick to your tried-and-proven Meltdown-Aura-Renzokuken combination to 
take her down. If she de-attaches a part of herself, it means she's
close to defeat -- keep it going!

FINAL BOSS: True Ultimecia  HP: 250,000+  Draw List: Holy, Flare
BOSS: Ultimecia (Lower half)  HP: 16,000+  Draw List: Apocalypse
                              Total AP: 0

Ultimecia, in all her final form glory, now has more offensive moves 
at her disposal; her Hell's Judgement can bring everyone down to 1 HP 
(easier time getting limit breaks though; in fact, you can just use a
Hero's Medicine on Squall, and have him launch his Renzokuken
repeatedly).

She'll also cast 'Ultima', 'Flare' and 'Holy' on you, and when her
lower body appears in the course of the fight, she'll draw 'Apocalypse'
from it, which hits the entire party for roughly 3,500+ worth of damage.
Take note that you can do the same to her, by beating her to drawing 
'Apocalypse'. Ultimecia will retain the annoying ability to remove an
entire set of spells from you, too.

Simply keep the Meltdown-Aura-Renzokuken combinations (I think you've 
gotten tired of that already ^_^) coming, and heal immediately when
she hits you with a Hell's Judgement -- she might cast 'Ultima' as her
next move. Try to dispose of her lower body first when it does appear.

When Ultimecia is near defeat, she'll start uttering lines in battle.
During this period, you have to pound on her about 4 to 5 times until
she finishes what she has to say; each attack usually results in her
speaking another line. Only when you've seen all she has to say then
can you strike the finishing blow.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Enjoy the ending!

*major spoiler here... skip this section if you want to see the ending 
 for yourself*
As an added bonus for those playing the Japanese version, I'll give you
the following dialogue in the ending sequence as it appears in the U.S
version. It isn't really accurate, so I hope you'll bear with it:

Irvine: Is it over?
        Let's go! Let's go back to our time!
Zell: Shut up! Just calm down now and think where we have to go.
Selphie: Careful guys, don't pick the wrong time!
Quistis: Whatever you do, don't fall into a time warp!
Rinoa: (Time... Places... Who I wanna be with...)
       (I wanna go there! Where Squall and I promised.)
Rinoa: Squall!
       Let's go home! Where are you!?
Squall: (... Where am I?)  (turns to see young Squall, and Edea)
Edea: Squall! Where are you going!?
Young Squall: I'm gonna find Sis!  (runs off)
Edea: Squall!
Squall: (... Matron)
Edea: Excuse me. Have you seen a little boy?
Squall: You don't have to worry.
        The boy won't go anywhere.
Edea: I think so, too. Poor thing...
(Ultimecia appears)
Squall: .... You're alive!?  (draws his Gunblade)
Edea: ... The sorceress?
Squall: Yes, Matron.
        We had defeated her... 
        Matron, stand back.
Edea: It's ok.
      There's no more need to fight.
      The sorceress is just looking for someone to pass her powers
      on to.
      In order to die in peace, a sorceress must be free of all her
      powers.
      I know... for I am one, too.
      I shall take over that sorceress' powers.
      I do not want one of the children to become one.
Ultimecia: I.... can't... disappear yet.  (Edea goes over to her)
Squall: Matron!
Edea: Is this... the end?
Squall: ... Most likely.
Edea: You called me Matron. Just who... are you?
Squall: A SeeD. A SeeD from Balamb Garden.
Edea: SeeD? Garden?
Squall: Both Garden and SeeD were your ideas.
        Garden trains SeeD.
        SeeDs are trained to defeat the sorceress.
Edea: What are you saying?
      You're... that boy from the future?
Squall: ... Matron.
Edea: Please return. You do not belong here.
Young Squall: I can't find Sis.
              ...Am I... all alone?  (notices the older Squall)
              Who's he?
Edea: Nobody.
      You don't need to know.
      The only Squall permitted here is you. (turns to the older Squall)
      Do you know where to go back to?
      Do you know how?
      Will you be all right by yourself?
Squall: (... I'll be all right, Matron.)
        (Because I'm not alone.)  (the screen fades)
        (... I'm not alone.)
        (... If I call out, they will answer.)
Squall: Where is everyone!?
        Rinoa! Where are you?
        Zell! Selphie! Quistis! Irvine!
        Rinoa!
        (Am I... alone?)
        (Rinoa? I want to hear your voice.)
        (Which way... do I go?)
        (I can't make it back... alone.)
Squall: Rinoa?
        (Am I... all alone again?)
        (Where... am I?)
*end spoiler*

You should see the ending FMV now... and don't turn the power off until
the words 'The End' appear on your screen, or you'll miss a short movie
after the credits.

Basically, the Appendix section is a quick reference guide for all
the locations of the G.Fs, magazines, blue magic, weapon remodeling
lists, rare cards and shopping lists.

If you want a list of G.Fs, spells, refinement abilities and other
miscellaneous information, I suggest you check out the game's Tutorial
or Part II of Scott Ong's 'Final Fantasy VIII FAQ' at www.gamefaqs.com.

<!> Tip:
In fact, I highly encourage you to take a closer look at the in-game
Tutorial; you'll be surprised at the info it contains (especially
in the Information section). Many people have written in asking about

{Squall}

Revolver: 6 Magic Stone Pieces, 2 Screws
Shear Trigger: 1 Steel Pipe, 4 Screws
Cutting Trigger: 1 Mesmerize Blade, 8 Screws
Flame Saber: 1 Betrayal Blade, 1 Turtle Shell, 4 Screws
Twin Lance: 1 Dino Bone, 2 Red Fangs, 12 Screws
Punishment: 1 Chef's Knife, 2 Star Fragments, 1 Turtle Shell, 8 Screws
Lion Heart: I get so much mail about this weapon! Here's the method --

1 Adamantine: Adamantoises found on Long Horn Island, north-west of
              Dollet drop it occasionally. They ONLY appear on the
              shores of Long Horn Island.
4 Dragon Fangs: Blue Dragons on the Island Closest to Hell (western
                -most island on Galbadian continent) drop it.
12 Pulse Ammo: Elnoyles found in Esthar Capital, after Lunar Cry event
               drop Energy Crystals at levels 40 and above. They're
               extremely rare, but you can pin-point their locations
               using the map of Esthar I've drawn up in Disc Three
               (event 4n) of the 'Walkthrough' section. It's marked
               with an 'E'.
               Use Ifrit's 'Refine Ammo' menu ability to refine 10
               Pulse Ammo from 1 Energy Crystal.

I recommend you get Lion Heart in Disc Three, after receiving the
Ragnarok. Getting it any earlier than that might prove difficult,
even though it's still possible to do so; you'll simply have to play
a lot of Card Battles to get the required raw materials.

g. [EXP and AP Havens]

For some serious EXP, head for the Island Closest to Hell, or the
Island Closest to Heaven in Disc Three and Four. Gaining AP can be
done relatively easily on Cactuar Island, which is in the Centra area,
east of Kashkabald Desert. Btw, the Heaven and Hell islands also hold
several (hidden) draw points on them.

If you want to build up your party, but have yet to receive the
Ragnarok, try Balamb Garden's Training Center for EXP, and Kashkabald
Desert in the Centra area for AP.

This walkthrough wouldn't have been possible without these great people;
I'll like to thank them here:

CJayC (gamefaqs@gamefaqs.com) for hosting this FAQ on his website.

Scott Ong (kangning@mbox5.singnet.com.sg) for his permission to use 
Disc Four of his Final Fantasy VIII FAQ Part I. It's at 
www.gamefaqs.com, under Final Fantasy VIII. Also check out his website 
at http://risland.square-eternity.com (The Round Island).

Heero Yuy (kanketsu@usa.net) for his permission to use his Final 
Fantasy VIII Walkthrough. It's at www.gamefaqs.com, under Final 
Fantasy VIII. Most of the decision points you see were referred from
his guide.

Steven Bruck (stevenbruck@bigfoot.com) for his permission to use his 
Guardian Force FAQ. It's at www.gamefaqs.com, under Final Fantasy VIII.
The majority of translated abilities were taken from his guide.

The Webmaster (tomo1657@aol.com) of http://ffmusic.vovoid.com (Musical 
World of Final Fantasy) for the lyrics to "Eyes on Me". 
"Eyes on Me" performed by Faye Wong, music composed by Nobuo Uematsu
and lyrics by Kazumi Someya.

John (kiros@ff8.org) for his translation guide. It's located at 
http://oro.simplenet.com/ff8 (The Unofficial Final Fantasy VIII 
Translation Homepage).

Kao Megura (kmegura@yahoo.com), whose ff 7 FAQ prompted me to 
re-organize the format of this FAQ somewhat.

GamePlayers Magazine from which most of the material in this guide was
referred from. Buy this if you can read Chinese; they offer some of the 
most comprehensive guides, reviews and previews for games.

The Final Fantasy VIII Official Strategy Guide by BradyGames for
providing one of the most detailed Bestiary sections I've ever seen.
Many of the Boss statistics in this FAQ were updated using it. The
changes made to the SeeD Ranking System in the U.S version were also
added using the Official Strategy Guide.

The trio of Jon Chang, Hodaka Tsyuchida and Mark Gilson for letting me 
use their translation guide for reference purposes - thanks people! 
Btw, if you're looking to find it, it's at www.gamefaqs.com, under 
Final Fantasy VIII Demo.


Final Author's Notes:
Once again, I'll like to thank the rest of you out there for reading
my guide; it's been great working on it, but perhaps it's best to end
it all now. I hope that this FAQ has been of some help to you. Feel
free to post any questions, I'll answer them as long as it doesn't
take too much effort.

Of course, mails on how to receive Squall's 'Lion Heart' weapon, plot
-related questions, sending you my guide, vague requests, why your HP
levels never seem to rise above 4,200, etc... will happily be tossed
into the trash can. I hope you understand ^_^

As for any readers who may wish to post this guide on their website,
all I request is for you to reproduce this document in its original
state, and that you credit me for it. I do not wish to see it being cut
up or altered, nor do I want to see information being blatantly rippped
off it.

And that's all.
