NOTE: Listing is in alphabetical order, except for Guard enemy, which eluded
me. I only found out I forgot to include it after I was done with the rest.
Since I don't intend to spend odd 5 hours correctin' every darn entry, I just
shot it at the end.

D) Considering magic classes
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Note: This will be a bit harder. I've had to come up with a new system I hope
you'll be familiar with (based somewhat on FF8's classifications)

   1. Attack class - this is any magic that deals damage in HP to your enemies.
      This class is further chunked up into...
      I. Fire class - Fire, Fira, Firaga
     II. Ice class - Blizzard, Blizzara, Blizzaga
    III. Thunder class - Thunder, Thundara, Thundaga
     IV. Water class - Water
      V. Wind class - Aero, Tornado
     VI. Earth class - Quake
    VII. Poison class - Bio
   VIII. Holy class - Holy
     IX. No-element class - Meteor, Ultima, Flare
      X. Gravity class - Demi

   2. Healing class - this is any magic that heals damage in HP to your
      members. Magics that fall into this category...
      Cure, Cura, Curaga, Regen, Life, Full-Life

   3. Status class - this is any magic that causes negative type/s of status/es
      to your members or your enemies. Magics in this category are...
      Meltdown, Silence, Blind, Confuse, Berserk, Sleep, Slow, Stop, Drain,
      Zombie, Pain, Death, Break, Dispel.

   4. Support class - this is any magic that causes positive type/s of
      status/es to your members or your enemies. Magics in this category are...
      Double, Triple, Float, Shell, Protect, Reflect, Haste, Esuna, Aura.

   5. Scan - I guess this deserves a special category.:) I can't really put it
      anywhere, heh.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
E) Considering special attack classes
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

There are monsters's attacks that fall into few special categories...

   1. Instant death class - these are attacks that will cause your member to be
      KO-ed unless under necessary protection (correct junction, Defend,
      Invincible, etc.).

   2. Vitality killer - these are attacks that ignore Vitality statistic.

   3. Spirit killer - these are attacks that ignore Spirit statistic.

   4. Desperation class - these are attacks used by monsters as a last ditch
      attempt to kill your members.

   5. Command class - these are attacks used by monsters and are cheap copies
      of your Command abilities.:) Most obvious example is Lefty's Draw.:)

   6. Critical strike class - these are physical type attacks rarely used by
      monsters. Accuracy of these attacks hitting your member/s is lower, but
      damage dealt if such attack connects will always be critical damage
      dealt.

   7. Succession class - these are attacks used after certain move is executed
      a certain amount of times and then a succession class move is used. Some
      exceptions apply.

   8. Countdown class - these are attacks that cause certain type of timer to
      appear above member's head. If timer is red, this is countdown to Instant
      death status. If timer is white, this is countdown to Petrify status.

   9. Member count class - these are attacks that can only be used by some
      monsters if a certain number of your members is alive. Such attacks
      cannot be used if 'number of members alive' prerequisite is not being
      met. Pretty obvious example is Ruby Dragon's Breath - it can only be used
      if all three members are alive.

  10. Monster count class - these are attacks used by certain monsters that can
      only be used if all or some of them are alive. If a vital chainpiece is
      missing, such attack cannot be executed.
      Note: Some attacks directly deal with amount of monsters a specific
      member has killed. These type of attacks will fall into this category.

  11. Round count class - these are moves or attacks used by certain monsters
      that last and / or are used a specific amount of turns.
      Under this category these magics fall - Regen, Reflect, Protect, Shell,
      Haste, Slow, Stop, Sleep - so whenever you see these mentioned by a
      specific monster, I will not mention this class there.
      There are some monster's moves that fall into this category and this
      class will be mentioned by such monsters.

  12. Counter class - these are all moves and attacks used by some monsters as
      their 'answers' to some actions of your members. There are many counter
      classes - view them below.

      12A. Magic counter class - these are moves or attacks used by some
           monsters as counters if your members use any magical means of
           attacks on such monster/s.

      12B. Physical counter class - these are moves or attacks used by some
           monsters as counters if your members use any physical means of
           attacks on such monster/s.

      12C. Stat booster class - these are moves or attacks used by a certain
           monster as this monster's 'answer' to a certain action your member/s
           performed on them. When this special class is used, one or more of
           this monster's statistics is/are increased.
           Note: There are two different versions of 'Stat booster' class. Some
           of them are counter class moves, whilst some of them are used after
           certain amount of turns passes or whatever other thing happens.

      12D. Stat loser class - these are moves or attacks used by a certain
           monster as this monster's 'answer' to a certain action your member/s
           performed on them. When this special class is used, one or more of
           this monster's statistics is/are lowered.
           Note: There are two different versions of 'Stat loser' class. Some
           of them are counter class moves, whilst some of them are used after
           certain amount of turns passes or whatever other thing happens.

      12E. Tactic change class - these are moves or attacks used by a certain
           monster as this monster's 'answer' to a certain action your member/s
           performed on them. When this counter class is used, this monster's
           battle tactics change.
           Note: There are two different versions of 'Tactic change' class.
           Some of them are counter class moves, whilst some of them are used
           after certain amount of turns passes or whatever other thing
           happens.

      12F. HP count class - these are moves or attacks used by a certain
           monster as this monster's 'answer' to a certain action your member/s
           performed on them. When this counter class is used, it means that
           your members have caused loss of HP to the monster they're fighting
           which went over the HP limit this monster has set before it is able
           to use this counter class move. It can be any type of member's
           attacks that can trigger this counter class move.

  13. Stat booster class - these are moves or attacks used by a certain monster
      as this monster's own action performed on it. When this special class is
      used, one or more of this monster's statistics is/are increased.

  14. Stat loser class - these are moves or attacks used by a certain monster
      as this monster's own action performed on it. When this special class is
      used, one or more of this monster's statistics is/are lowered.

  15. First strike class - these are attacks that are always used by some
      monsters as their first attack regardless of the actions you've done so
      far in the battle against those monsters.

  16. HP count class - these are moves or attacks used by a certain monster
      once you deal enough damage to this monster. From now on there is a
      possibility that this monster will use an attack, specially designed to
      be used if such event took place - here the event being this monster's HP
      dropping below the limit level.

  17. Tactic change class - these are moves or attacks used by a certain
      monster as this monster's own action performed on it. When this counter
      class is used, this monster's battle tactics change.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
F) Who are 'Enemies', 'Allies', 'Monsters', 'Targets' and 'Members'?
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

   1. Enemies - in this case enemies are considered your party members.
      Whenever you'll see words 'affected enemy' or sth similar, know that it
      was *your member* who was targetted.

   2. Allies - in this case allies are considered monsters.

   3. Monsters - Self-explanatory.

   4. Targets - in this case targets can be both your members or monsters
      you're fighting. I'll be mentioning targets by the attacks that can be
      reflected and there's no 100% sure way of knowing that it hits either
      enemies (ie your members) or allies (ie monsters).

   5. Members - Self-explanatory.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
G) TARGETTED, AFFECTED... WTF?
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

   1. Targetted - will be used mainly in descriptions of physical attacks (also
      if physical attack is able to inflict any statuses, word targetted will
      be used)

   2. Affected - will be used mainly in descriptions of magic attacks

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
---------------------------- ABBREVIATION SECTION -----------------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
A) Considering attacks
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

   1. ST stands for Single Target
   2. AT stands for All Targets
   3. NT stands for No Target
   4. PA stands for physical attack
   5. MA stands for magical attack

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
B) Considering Magic classifications
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Note: This will be a bit harder. I've had to come up with a new system I hope
you'll be familiar with (based somewhat on FF8's classifications)

   1. Attack class magic - this is any magic that deals damage in HP to your
      enemies. This class is further classified into...
      I. Fire class - Fire, Fira, Firaga
     II. Ice class - Blizzard, Blizzara, Blizzaga
    III. Thunder class - Thunder, Thundara, Thundaga
     IV. Water class - Water
      V. Wind class - Aero, Tornado
     VI. Earth class - Quake
    VII. Poison class - Bio
   VIII. Holy class - Holy
     IX. No-element class - Meteor, Ultima, Flare, Demi
      X. Gravity class - this class doesn't exist, but technically there are
         several moves which are based on this element

   2. Healing class magic - this is any magic that heals damage in HP to your
      members. Magics that fall into this category...
      Cure, Cura, Curaga, Regen, Life, Full-Life

   3. Status class magic - this is any magic that causes negative type/s of
      status/es to your members or your enemies. Magics in this category are...
      Meltdown, Silence, Blind, Confuse, Berserk, Sleep, Slow, Stop, Drain,
      Zombie, Pain, Death, Break, Dispel.

   4. Support class magic - this is any magic that causes positive type/s of
      status/es to your members or your enemies. Magics in this category are...
      Double, Triple, Float, Shell, Protect, Reflect, Haste, Esuna, Aura.

   5. Scan - I guess this deserves a special category.:) I can't really put it
      anywhere, heh.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
C) Considering special attack classes
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

See, some enemy's moves cannot be classified correctly in my vocab, that's why
I've thought of the following classes...

   1. Item class move - these are all moves when the enemy uses an item on
      itself (but the animation of the enemy doing so would be the one as if
      casting magic). Moves in this category are...
      Potion, Hi-Potion, Remedy

   2. Instant-death class move - these are all moves that will cause your
      member to be KO-ed unless under necessary protection (correct junction,
      Invincible, Defend etc.). Moves in this category are...
      Death, Lv5 Death, 10000 Needles, Zantetsuken, Light Pillar

   3. Special class move - these are all the moves that have a certain
      specificications behind them (well, it's tough to explain:)). Moves in
      this category are...
      Sai, It's Sharp!, Corona, Hell's Judgment, Megido Flame, Thunder Summon,
      Onrush, Mega Spark, Mega Pulse Cannon, Mini Pulse Cannon, Dark Flare,
      Mega Flare, Terra Break

   4. Counterattack class move - these are all the moves that are used by
      certain enemies as their response to your member's attacks launched
      against them.

   5. Desperation class move - these are all the moves that are used by certain
      enemies as a last ditch attempt to kill your members. Moves in this
      category are...
      Catoblepas' Meteor, Krysta's Ultima, Griever's Shockwave Pulsar

   6. Command class move - these are all the moves that are used by certain
      enemies and are a cheap copies of your Command abilities.:) Moves in this
      category are...
      Griever's Draw, Ultimecia's Draw Apocalypse

-------------------------------- LET US BEGIN! --------------------------------
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

What to do before encountering first boss???

1. Some good magic can be obtained from the enemies which stand at your
disposal now but to able to do so, you must gain a few levels for enemies to
start having better magic in their draw list.
Grat - Silence, Berserk, Confuse, Sleep
T-Rexaur - Quake, Firaga
Fastitocalon-F - Water
Caterchipillar - Curaga, Slow, Stop, Thundaga
Glacial Eye - Blizzaga
You can already have Tornado spell as well, but you must get Abyss Worm card
first. If you don't want this spell now, move on - but Tornado is a great spell
for now to junction to Str or Mag.

2. Have Quezo and Shiva learn all junction abilities they currently have, then
move onto...
a) Quezo - Card, Card Mod, El.Att.J, El.Def.J, El.Def.Jx2 (screw Med Mag-RF,
it's useless)
b) Shiva - Doom (Shiva must reach Lv10), El.Att.J, El.Def.J, El.Def.Jx2
TIP: For quick AP fight Fastitocalon-Fs on Rinaul coast, you're guaranteed to
receive 6 AP from every fight with them.

3. Cards! Cards! Cards!
- Do NOT miss talking to the guy in front of the elevator - he'll give you 7
cards. One of them is Gesper card. Once Quezo knows Card Mod, mod the card into
Blach Hole and use it on Quistis to learn one of most used Blue Magics thru the
game - Degenerator.
- Challenge the small boy running around in the Garden. He holds a Minimog
card.
- Challenge either one of three Trepies and after some card battles walk away
with Quistis card.
- From Trepie #1 in Cafeteria get 4x Malboro card. Mod them into Malboro
Tentacle and use this item on Quistis for her to learn Bad Breath.
- If you need some quick strong cards, go to Fire cave and Card some Bombs.

4. Squall's Lionheart...
Get first ingredient for this weapon by defeating Lv20 - Lv30 T-Rexaur. Dragon
Fangs are a rare drop, but it's worth it.:)

------------------------
#101 - BOSS PREPARATIONS
------------------------

I. RECOMMENDED JUNCTIONING OF AVAILABLE GFS

First I will list the recommended members available, then what GFs to junction
to that particular member.

Squall --> Shiva
Quistis --> Quezo

II. RECOMMENDED JUNCTION ABILITIES

Below lies the list of all possible junction abilities you can learn with all
GFs currently at your disposal.
First is the list of junction abilities you can learn, then info on which GFs
can learn this ability and finally recommended spells to put on that junction
ability.
NOTE: The rest of junction abilities (ie Spd, Hit etc) I will start mentioning
once you actually have the chance to learn such ability, but for now you just
worry about the ones you're able to learn.

1. HP --> Quezo --> Healing class
2. Str --> Shiva --> Any attack class (best Quake or Tornado)
3. Vit --> Quezo, Shiva --> Healing class
4. Mag --> Quezo --> Any attack class (best Quake or Tornado)
5. Spr --> Shiva --> Healing class
6. El.Att.J --> Quezo, Shiva --> Ice class
7. El.Def.J --> Quezo, Shiva --> Fire class
8. El.Def.Jx2 --> Quezo, Shiva --> Fire class

III. RECOMMENDED COMMAND ABILITIES

Below is the list of recommended Command abilities for this battle.
First is the number of available slot for your command box during battle,
followed by what Command ability should be junctioned for that slot. In the end
you will be able to find out what GFs are able to learn that particular Command
ability.

Squall
Slot 1 --> Attack --> N/A
Slot 2 --> Magic --> Any
Slot 3 --> Item --> Any
Slot 4 --> Draw --> Any

Slot 3 --> Item --> Any
Slot 4 --> Draw --> Any

IV. RECOMMENDED CHARACTER ABILITIES

Below is the list of recommended Character abilities for this battle.
First you will see the number of the slot, then what ability should be there,
and lastly what GFs are able to learn that ability.
Note: You are able to have up to four character ability slots, but currently
there is no way to do so. You'll have to wait until the start of disc 2.

Squall
Slot 1 --> Vit+??% --> Shiva
Slot 2 --> Spr+??% --> Shiva

Quistis
Slot 1 --> Mag+20% --> Quezo
Slot 2 --> Mag+40% --> Quezo

--------------------
#102 - IFRIT'S MOVES
--------------------

Below is the list of all moves this boss is capable of pulling off.
First thing listed is the name of the attack, then info on how can this attack
be classified, and finally advice on what countermeasures (CM for short) you
can take to lessen (nullify / or even absorb) the damage done by that type of
attack.

1. Fire --> ST Fire class MA
CM --> Higher Spr, Fire class magic to El.Def.J
2. (Jump and punch) --> ST no-name PA
CM --> Higher Vit

--------------------------
#103 - RECOMMENDED TACTICS
--------------------------

Physical attacks and/or limit breaks.
--> Don't bother casting magic or summoning GFs, except if you may need
healing, but I find that hard to believe. I mean - It's Ifrit you're up against
and he's a big LOL of a boss.

---------------------
#104 - BOSS STRATEGY!
---------------------

Ifrit only knows two attacks - either casting Fire or jumping in the air and
then punching one member (high probability of succeeding in landing a critical
strike). Eliminate Fire threat by junctioning Fire / Fira / Firaga to El.Def.J.
As far as Ifrit's PA goes, have something on Vit-J to reduce the damage.
You may choose to toy around with him a bit.:) Try various Blue magic to be
used on him - Ultra Waves, Bad Breath, Fire Breath (OK, not really, but it's
funny to see it used against him, hehe). Too bad no status can be inflicted on
Ifrit - I'd like to see him smack himself.:)
One last thing - I know that defeating Ifrit is a major part of SeeD exam, but
IMO you shouldn't really be bothered with that. Just kill him with whatever
timer is there on the clock and don't pay any attention as to what your grades
are going to be.
Money is not important in the game! Many very useful items can be gotten by
mugging the enemies or thru playing cards - for example, get 4x Malboro Card,
Card Mod them into Malboro Tentacle and use it on Quistis and... voila! Quistis
knows Bad Breath.;)

Ifrit only has 1068 HP. The member with Str-J and anything decent junctioned to
Str-J would take him down with 1 attack.:)

Summon Shiva to attack Ifrit...
Ifrit: 'They have Shiva!?'

Just before Ifrit does his first physical attack...
Ifrit: 'Impudent humans!'

In middle of the battle...
Ifrit: 'Hm! Not bad for a human.'

Waste Ifrit by yourself...
Ifrit: 'For me to lose to a human...'
'Very well, I will join you.'

Waste Ifrit by Shiva...
Ifrit: 'Ugh, I underestimated Shiva.'
'Very well, I will join you.'

Victory Fanfare! Congratulations!

What to do before encountering next boss???

1. Next area Dollet is a wonderful opportunity to stock up on some good spells!
You should be especially interested into:
Anacondaur - Bio (!!!)
Elite Soldier - Dispel (!!!), Fire / Thunder / Ice class spells
G-Soldier - Cure / Cura / Curaga
NOTE: If you think that these suggestions of the magic you should draw mean
that you'll be casting them as crazy in the upcoming boss fights, you're in for
a big mistake. The main purpose of drawing the magic right now like mad is
simply for better junctioning.

2. Also, next bosses ahead are an excellent chance to gain over 500 AP - yep,
you heard me right, over five hundred (!) AP. Do you want the rest of the game
to be easy? Yes? I thought so... so, it would be in your best interest to gain
a few levels while you're around this area to be able to draw highest class
spells (Firaga, Thundaga, Blizzaga, Curaga etc.)
But, but, but... no buts. So what if the enemies are going to be stronger?
There are at least four reasons why you shouldn't be afraid of doing so:
a) Likeliness of you receiving better items increases (used for refining,
getting magic, weapons upgrading etc. etc.)
b) Bosses do level up as you do, but they have a level block, ie they cannot
exceed a certain level, for example Ifrit - he can't exceed Lv 6 when you fight
him (this doesn't apply for some boss battles, tho' - you'll be warned of such
battles)
c) Higher and better spells for you to draw, thus improving your junctions
d) Having more GF abilities learned, furthermore making your gameplay easier

3. Absolutely have Ifrit learn Str+??% abilities and Str Bonus ability ASAP!!!
Then move onto El.Att.J, El.Def.J, El.Def.Jx2, Fire Mag-RF, Ammo RF. Finally,
screw Mad Rush, it's useless.

--------------------------
#203 - RECOMMENDED TACTICS
--------------------------

Physical attacks and/or limit breaks. Well, lemme just say here that physical
attacks and limit breaks will be your main form of offense when facing any
boss.
--> Magic stat will play somewhat big role here. Stock up on Esunas and
Doubles. Most importantly, do not forget to draw Siren. Her abilities are
invaluable! Healing yourself should not be a problem, since you should have
some good healing magic in your magic stock? No? Well, then the bosses will
heal you instead (El.Def.J!!).:)

Use this opportunity for Selphie's Slots limit! Try to get her use Full-Cure,
Wall, Rapture. The End is highly improbable to show up, but it can be done.

--------------------
#204 - BOSS STRATEGY
--------------------

Biggs: 'Prepare for the worst, you brats!'

Geez, we haven't even started yet, and Biggs is already bigmouthing off. Heh.:)
Anyway, start by drawing Esunas. DO NOT attack Biggs yet! His attacks are weak
and his magic will heal you (did you remember to put correct magic on
El.Def.J?). If by any chance you get seriously hurt, heal yourself. After a few
turns Wedge will join in the fun. Oh really?

Wedge: 'Major Biggs...'
'Have you finished the repairs, sir?'
'What is the enemy doing here!?'
Biggs: 'WEDGE! Where were you!?'
'No pay for you this month!'
Wedge: '...Should've stayed home!'

Yep, he's right. He should've stayed home.:) Now that they're two enemies to
deal with, what should you do? Continue drawing Esunas until each member has
100x Esuna stocked (no more need for stupid Remedies:)). Then kick their asses
into oblivion by physical attacks (Biggs may counterattack). If you decide to
plaster Wedge first...

Wedge: 'Major! We're doomed!'
Biggs: 'Stop your whining!'

Biggs will now start using Cure either on himself or Wedge. Ok, enough fun,
deplete either one's HP to 0 to meet the real boss...

Biggs: 'What the...!?'
Wedge: 'Ahhhhhh!'

And depending on what members are alive, they say the following...

Zell: 'What the hell is it?'
Squall: 'What the...!?'
Selphie: 'Huh? What is it?'

OH NO! Elvoret! A biiig monster shaped shadow. May prove tough, but I'm here to
prove otherwise. First start by drawing Siren! 50% of the battle is now past
you. Other important spell to get hold of is Double (for you magic users), but
you physical users can safely skip it.
Elvoret is a boring boss... his attack pattern is always the same - for two
turns he will either physically attack somebody or cast one of two spells
(Fire, Thunder). Every third turn Elvoret will use Storm Breath. Despite it's
name this attack is not Thunder based, it is non-elemental, therefore only way
to decrease the damage is by having higher Spr or by Shell status. Don't have
any members in double digit HP and you will be fine!
Elvoret's HP is somewhat of a medium size. A couple of good strong physical
attacks (Str-J by Shiva and Ifrit!!!) will take him down.

Victory Fanfare! Congratulations!

What to do before encountering next boss???

1. Well, time to beef yourself up for the upcoming battle. Time to get those
500+ AP I was talking about before. Quickly go down the elevator and save at
the nearby save point.

2. If you still haven't had Quezo, Shiva and Ifrit learn their important
junction abilities (ie HP-J, Str-J etc.), now is the good time to do so.
a) Quezo - Card, Card Mod, El.Att.J, El.Def.J, El.Def.Jx2 (screw Med Mag-RF,
it's useless)
b) Shiva - Doom (Shiva must reach Lv10), El.Att.J, El.Def.J, El.Def.Jx2
c) Ifrit - Str+??%, Str Bonus, Fire RF, Ammo RF
d) Siren - First have her learn St.Def.Jx2, then L Mag-RF, then ST Mag-RF, then
Tool-RF, then Mag+??%, then Mag Bonus, then Move-Find, then Treatment (gained
at level 12)

3. Killing next boss is hard and tedious, but not impossible. There are two
huge rewards if you do kill this boss.
a) Boss drops a very useful item
b) Huge amount of AP

--------------------------
#303 - RECOMMENDED TACTICS
--------------------------

Limit breaks all the way!!!
--> Don't bother casting magic except Drawing and casting Protect and healing
your members when needed. And especially don't bother casting GFs, as they're a
pure waste of time.

---------------------
#304 - BOSS STRATEGY!
---------------------

Geez, I thought we wasted enough bosses already. Oh well, one more can't
hurt.;)

1. Way with no AP...
If you still don't have relevant junction abilities, you're gonna have to fight
a bit longer. It really helps if you put Thunder class magic on El.Att.J of at
least one member. Being able to inflict higher damage on the boss will prove as
a major advantage to your members in this and in upcoming fights, so why not
try to exploit these advantages right now as well? X-ATM092 is a good test
bunny to do so.:)
(Knock down) Black Widow before it is able to attack for the fifth time. If you
don't succeed, you'll get Ray Bomb-ed. Keep your HP above 300. Black's (leg
punch) and Arm Crush are launched against single ally and they don't deal
obscene amounts of damage, if you have decent Vit-J. Clash attacks all members,
so keep your HP above 300 anyway. You can Draw and cast Protect on your members
(Black Widow carries Protect (stock some if you wish) - good spell for Vit-J,
but you should have better spells already). Right, so you've got him (knocked
down)?
Zell: 'Let's get the hell outta here!'
Squall: 'Alright, withdraw!'
Selphie: 'Hurry to the rendezvous!'
*Press L2 and R2 to escape.*
Do so and you're out of harms way for now. But if you fail to escape...
Zell: 'Huh? Is it repairing itself?'
Squall: 'A self-repair mechanism...?'
Selphie: 'No more!'
Oh well, you'll have to take it down again. But this time, DO hold down escape
buttons! On next screen after the conversaton ends, run down. On next screen
HOLD left! X-ATM092 will just barely miss you. On next screen WALK down the
path, don't run! If you do, you'll have to fight Black Widow again. Next screen
run to the lower right. On the bridge there is a possibility for X-ATM092 not
to catch you by having to do various turns left and right until you get lost.;)
Oh well, just fight him again, I say. Now we're near the fountain. Save the
damn dog or not...
Run past the car. Do NOT hide in the pub. One more screen and we're out of
harms way. Gooo, Quistis!

2. Way with oh-so-much AP
Pre-requisite --> Squall with mucho high Str-J and Thundaga on El.Att.J in
critical status (just so that he's able to pull off Renzokuken)
Strike 1 - When Black Widow catches you down there in the dumps, strike him
down with your powered Squall. I manage to drain away all X-ATM092'S HP in a
single Renzokuken. Then just attack him physically once more to (knock down)
and then escape. 50 AP!
Strike 2 - When Zell comments 'I thought we already busted it up.', bust it up
again for another 50 AP --> St.Def.Jx2 is now learned. Switch to L Mag-RF!
Strike 3 - On the screen where Selphie jumped down the cliff, bust up the
stupid robot for third time. New 50 AP. Switch to ST Med-RF!
Strike 4 - RUN down the path for fourth busting up the annoying robot. Another
50 AP! Switch to Tool RF!
Strike 5 - On the screen where you fought first Anacondaur, meet up with robot
for the fifth time for another 50 AP! Switch to Mag+20%!
Strike 6 and onward - Fight the robot on the bridge over and over. Please note
that you can't access the menu for the time that you spend running around on
the bridge. BUT you can 'kill' the robot as many times as you wish on the
bridge (each defeat will bring 50 AP - defeat Black Widow for twelve times and
Siren will learn all her GFHP+??% and SumMag+??% abilities before moving on).
In case you don't want to do that, run to the fountain screen and switch to
Mag+40%! Then defeat the spider for another 50 AP here to learn at least a bit
of AP needed for that particular ability. Last time you can fight the thing is
in front of the pub, which is also when you should kill it permanently! Deplete
its HP to 0 for 6 or so times in that particular fight to finally see that damn
annoyance blow up! Last 50 AP for you and a very good item.

Result: Almost every ability of your four GFs so far has been learned!

'No' Victory Fanfare! Congratulations!

What to do before encountering next boss???

1. Still don't have El.Att.J and El.Def.J abilities learned? Now it's the
second to last time to do you whilst the enemies are still easy. Try to beef
yourself up for the upcoming battles. There's an optional boss coming up, that
has two great magics for you. I'll mention him later. For now, concentrate on
gaining a few levels and collecting whatever loose magic you may have missed.

2. Again, info on what order I'd recommned you to have your GFs learn their
abilities. This is the last time I'll be mentioning these four. From next
strategy section onward only newly acquired GFs will be mentioned.
a) Quezo - Card, Card Mod, El.Att.J, El.Def.J, El.Def.Jx2 (screw Med Mag-RF,
it's useless)
b) Shiva - Doom (Shiva must reach Lv10), El.Att.J, El.Def.J, El.Def.Jx2
c) Ifrit - Str+??%, Str Bonus, Fire RF, Ammo RF
d) Siren - First have her learn St.Def.Jx2, then L Mag-RF, then ST Mag-RF, then
Tool-RF, then Mag+??%, then Mag Bonus, then Move-Find, then Treatment (gained
at level 12)

3. Get Zell's card from Ma Dincht!!! This should add a valuable asset to your
card playing hand (Ifrit, MiniMog, Quistis).

4. Next boss is an easy one, so don't fret. Good junctions are all it takes to
make this battle a breeze.

--------------------

What a relief. An easy battle. After getting annoyed to death by running into
X-ATM092 over and over this is something to ease off your mind. Start by
Drawing and casting Sleep on Granaldo (member with high Mag-J) or attacking
Granaldo with member that has Sleep on St.Att.J. This eliminates any and all
attacks.:)
So Draw the desired spells, putting Granaldo to sleep as necessary. To further
add insult to the boss/es, they can all be Degenerated and inflicted with
various statuses.

--------------------------
#A03 - RECOMMENDED TACTICS
--------------------------

Physical attacks and/or limit breaks.
--> Magic stat again be important for a while. Stock up on Holies and Flares.

Advised level for this fight is above 30. If it's less, than you will be unable
to Draw Flare from Diablos! If you need a few quick levels, try somewhat fixed
T-Rexaur random battle on the screen left from Save point screen.

--------------------
#A04 - BOSS STRATEGY
--------------------

Diablos: 'Who dares disturb my sleep?'

Let's see here. Diablos has only one attack that can kill you and that is his
physical attack. How can we fix that? Use Zell (or whoever you put Siren on) to
attack Diablos until he's blinded.:) Diablos blinded + none of his other
attacks can kill you = victory!
BUT first start Drawing Holies and Flares! Remember to beef up Mag-J before the
battle with Diablos commences or else you'll be Drawing 4 or less Flares per
turn... or none at all, if Mag-J is too low.
If a member gets KO-ed (rare chance, but it can happen), revive him/her with
Phoenix down. Once again, Demi and Gravija attacks *cannot* kill you in any way
possible. Screw Demi spell - we can get it thru refining later easier.
Once each member of the party has 100x Holy and 100x Flare, unleash your limit
breaks which have been aching to be used for quite some time now.:)

Diablos: 'Too much sleep... Too weak...'

What to do before encountering next boss???

1. Ah, a new GF... finally. Here's the advised order of learning...
a) Diablos - Time Mag RF, ST Mag-RF, HP-J, Mug, Darkside, Enc-Half, Enc-None,
Hit-J, HP+20%, HP+40%, HP+80%

2. Go back into Balamb Garden and enter Headmaster's Office. Challenge Cid to a
card game and try to win Seifer card from him.

3. Card Mod Quistis card into 3x Samantha Soul. Refine 1x Samantha Soul into
60x Triple with Diablos' Time Mag-RF. Triples are excellent boosters for Str
and Mag.

4. If you already have Siren's L Mag-RF, check your items a bit. 1x Saw Blade
refines into 10x Death, 1x Chef's Knife refines into 30x Death, 1x Tent refines
into 10x Curaga, 1x Mesmerize Blade refines into 20x Regen and and and... Where
did I get all these items from? Card playing, of course. One more reason why
you should devote some time to card playing.;)

5. When in first Laguna dream, make a detour in Deling and enter the sewers.
Fight Red Bats there and Draw Drains from them (will prove useful for future
fights). There is also a very small area in the sewers where you can run into
Creeps. Draw Lifes from this monster (will prove useful for future fights).

6. If by a chance you've acquired some Curse Spikes from Tri-Face cards - 1x
Curse Spike refines into 10x Pain. Pain is a great magic to junction to
St.Def.J.

7. TOP TIP!!!
Challenge Watts to a card game and make sure you win his Angelo card! This card
mods into 100x Elixir.

8. Have any Gayla cards? Card Mod them into 1x Mystery Fluid per 1x Gayla card.
1x Mystery Fluid refines into 10x Meltdown, best magic for Vit-J.

--------------------------
#503 - RECOMMENDED TACTICS
--------------------------

Physical attacks and/or limit breaks.

Advised level for this fight is above 30. If you plastered Diablos before, you
should already be higher than that. If you still haven't killed Diablos, then
even level 20 and above will be sufficient.

This is also the point of the game (if you're past Lv 30) when you should stop
leveling up. From next boss strategy onward this section will no longer exist.

--------------------
#504 - BOSS STRATEGY
--------------------

Right. Easy battle again.:) But the boss is of undead type, you tell? No
worries, that is actually more convenient for you.

Fake President: 'YOu...fEll...FOr...iT'
'kiLL...thE...REsisTanCE...'
'aMusINg... tHIs iS AmuSinG!'

These are just little ramblings from our fake friend. All he knows is a simple
physical attack. Dispose of him in any way you wish.:) Now the real boss will
pop up - Gerogero. Depending on what characters are alive...

Squall: 'What the...?'
Selphie: 'Ewww! Nasty!'
Zell: '... The hell is this!?'

Easy way out: Use a Phoenix Down on Gerogero to kill him instantly. Other items
that work wonders on him: X-Potion, Elixir. Bam! Quick vistory!:)

Well, if you choose to fight him fair and square, here's what to do... Have a
member with Siren junctioned (in my case Zell) and put Silence (OR Pain) and
Berserk on St.Def.J. If Squall gets berserked, even better, hehe. Selphie is
kinda useless in this fight IMO.
Plus a good junctioned spells (Holy class, Fire class, Earth class) will do the
job done way better than in case if you'd bother summoning GFs or casting
magic. Gerogero is an annoying boss. Often he'll use 'Brrawghh!', a move that
does damage and causes Slow, Curse and Darkness statuses. Silence and Berserk
are his other two annoying attacks. If someone gets berserked, have Zell use
Treatment on that member (Zell can't be affected by Berserk, cos he has it
junctioned on St.Def.J). If you don't have Treatment yet, Draw and cast Esuna
on affected members. Gerogero conveniently has this magic to Draw.
Gerogero also knows Dispel - I wonder why? I can rarely have Reflect now
(Slots) and casting Shell and Protect on members is kinda useless cos these
statuses may be dispelled.
Anyway, just pummel him hard and he'll go down. Or use a Phoenix Down.;)

Victory Fanfare! Congratulations!

What to do before encountering next boss???

1. There's a lot of things to be done before we move on.:)
- For starters enter Roshfall forest and fight Ochu there. Draw and stock Pains
from Lv30 and above Ochus. Mug some Ochu Tentacles from them as well for
Quistis' weapons.
- Go to the beach near Dollet and fight Lv30 and above Adamantoises. They have
Reflect for you to Draw. Also mug them for Whispers and use this item on
Quistis for her to learn White Wind, excellent Blue Magic. Other items of
importance are Orihalcons (mug them), which teach a GF Vit+40% ability and
Adamantines (drop items - DO NOT mug Adamantoise), which teach a GF Vit+60%
ability and are used for some of character's strongest weapons.
- Fight some Wendigos and Mug Steel Pipes from them. Steel Pipes refine into
Aura Stones with help of Siren's Tool-RF. Aura Stones will help you
immensely.:)
- In second Laguna dream be sure to fight Lv30+ Elastoids! Draw Meltdown from
them, greatest magic to be put on Vit-J. Also mug a few Laser Cannons. Use one
to teach Quistis Homing Laser Blue Magic. Refine 3 of them with Ifrit's Ammo-RF
into 15x Pulse ammo. Last ingredient for Squall's Lionheart!
- When fighting Vysage trio, they rarely drop Regen Ring item. 1x Regen Ring
refines into 20x Full-Life with Siren's L Mag-RF. Full-Life is the best spell
to put on Spr.

2. TOP TIP!!!
Enter now rebuilt Dollet and enter the pub. Challenge the guy upstairs next to
the table and win this card battle! Then you'll be invited into this guys
private room. Keep challenging him and win your next prize: Siren card!!!
This is the greatest card so far in terms of usefulness.:) Card Mod it into 3x
St.Att. item, which teaches a GF St.Att.J ability. Use them wisely on selective
few GFs you have so far - but spare a single St.Att. item for now just in case.
Now we're talking business. All three battle members now are able to junction
magic to St.Att.J, one of most important junction abilities in the game.

3. If you haven't done so already...
Card Mod Quistis card into 3x Samantha Soul. Refine 1x Samantha Soul into 60x
Triple with Diablos' Time Mag-RF. Triples are excellent boosters for Str and
Mag.

4. Again some info on good magic...
If you already have Siren's L Mag-RF, check your items a bit. 1x Saw Blade
refines into 10x Death, 1x Chef's Knife refines into 30x Death, 1x Tent refines
into 10x Curaga, 1x Mesmerize Blade refines into 20x Regen and and and...
Where did I get all these items from? Card playing, of course. One more reason
why you should devote some time to card playing.;)

5. Before encountering next storyline boss, it is a good idea to make a detour
into Tomb of the Unknown King to fight next optional boss.

--------------------
#B03 - BOSS STRATEGY
--------------------

There are two boss fights ahead of you before you can claim your next GF. First
you'll have to deal with Sacred alone.

A) SACRED BOSS FIGHT

Yawn. Boring fight. Sacred only knows one puny physical attack, but it is a
powerful one - have high Vit-J. You have two options now...
- either you let Sacred keep attacking you and he'll escape after a few rounds.
- or you deplete his HP as quickly as you can before he escapes for 20 AP and
8x G-Hi-Potion.

'THEY'RE PRETTY STRONG...':)

B) SACRED AND MINOTAUR BOSS FIGHT

A bit tougher fight, but not by much. This time you're off against two enemies,
each one can regenerate his HP at regular intervals. Casting Float on them is a
totally pointless idea, cos it wastes turns and it doesn't work that long.
Start the battle by Drawing and casting Protect on your members, then cast
Meltdown on Minotaur - he's your primary target. Why? Although it may seem to
be a good idea to go after Sacred first as he has less HP, it's better to get
rid of Minotaur first as he has Mower move, which attacks all members (have
high Vit or be under Protect to lessen the damage done by Mower), and also his
single-target physical attack is almost twice as powerful as Sacred's.
Have the member with Diablos attacking by using Darkside command (if same
member has Drain on St.Att.J, his/her HP will be restored;)). This is useful
cos it deals 3x greater physical damage than by using simple physical attack.
Sometimes during the fight if both Sacred and Minotaur are still alive, they
can use Mad Cow Special attack. Pretty powerful Earth class attack, but easy to
evade. How? Junction Float and/or Quake to El.Def.J and damage will be
nullified or even absorbed. Now that you've plastered Minotaur, go after
Sacred, the puny one.:) Beat him and you'll receive some items as well as two
excellent cards.

If you plaster Sacred first...
Sacred: 'BRO, I LOST...'
Minotaur: 'the brothers, defeated...'
'mighty ones...'
'may we join you?'

If you plaster Minotaur first...
Minotaur: 'the rest is up to you, brother...'
Sacred: 'THE BROTHERS, DEFEATED...'
'I GUESS WE'LL JOIN YA.'

targetted member along with some Fire class magical damage
CM --> Higher Spr, Shell status, Defend status, Fire class magic on El.Def.J
AND Break on St.Def.J

--------------------
#603 - BOSS STRATEGY
--------------------

Irvine: 'Oh, I forgot to tell you...'
'For my Limit Break, Shot,'
'pull the trigger with R1.'
'Got it?'

No Irvine, I'm too thickheaded to got that. Sheez, just shut up and concentrate
on the next boss. If you followed the preparations above, Irvine is the
untouchable one here.:) He can't be petrified nor is he able to take fire
damage (instead he'll absorb it).
Have Irvine designated as the healer of Petrifying status in this battle,
should Squall fall victim of that status. Quickly plaster one Iguion and send
him meet his maker before concentrating your efforts on second Iguion.
Absolutely make sure to draw Carbuncle!!! You simply can't allow yourself to
miss her!!! She is the second GF with St.Def.J ability so far and you need this
ability badly for the upcoming fights. Drain on St.Att.J should take care of
your healing. This is especially useful with Irvine when you have him use
Darkside command.

What? You don't have any of the stuff above, ie Treatment, Darkside, Mug, etc.?
Well, in that case it will be tougher a bit, but not much.
You can Draw Cure from Iguions --> healing your members is guaranteed.
You can Draw Esuna from Iguions --> healing Petrifying status has been taken
care of.
You can Draw Break from Iguions --> if by any chance you still don't have any
Breaks, now is a good time to do so.
Absolutely Draw Carbuncle!!!
Apart from these tips, quickly kill one Iguion to eliminate annoying Resonance.
Then toy around with the other Iguion, but be careful of him toying around with
you, ie not forgetting to heal Petrifying status when it occurs!

This is second to last easy fight for this disc. One more boss fight before we
pop in second disc.

When you're satisfied with the amount of magic you drew, kill the remaining
Iguion.

Victory Fanfare! Congratulations!

What to do before encountering next boss???

1. MUG MUG MUG!!!
It is very advisable that you finally learn Mug character ability by Diablos
before the end of disc 1!

2. Finally you have three GFs with Vit-J - Quezo, Shiva and Carbuncle.

3. Here's Carbuncle's list of recommended order for her abilities to be
learnt...
a) Carbuncle - Recov Med-RF, St.Att.J, St.Def.J, St.Def.Jx2, Vit+20%, Vit+40%,
Vit Bonus, HP+20%, HP+40%, Counter, Auto-Reflect

4. One of the last calls for you to go and fight Diablos, if you haven't done
so yet. Flares you can draw from Lv 30+ Diablos will prove very useful in the
next boss battle.

TOP TIP!!!
Did you defeat Diablos yet???
Junctioning 100x Flare and 100x Protect to El.Def.J will completely nullify the
damage Edea will throw at you. How can you lose then?:)

--------------------
#703 - BOSS STRATEGY
--------------------

First it's Squall VS Seifer!

Seifer: 'Squall, you're mine!

Ugh, thanks, but I think I'll pass.:)
Seifer is no match for Squall, if you chose to follow my advice.;) Seifer's
sword swipe will cause puny damage to you and Fira move will be absorbed.:)
Mwahahaha. Anyway, don't kill Seifer too fast. Mug him for 1x Hero.

As the battle goes on...

Seifer: 'Thought I was dead, eh?'
'Not until I fulfill my dream!'
'Ugh, not bad...'
'Squall, this is it!'

If there's a chance that you're not junctioned properly or are missing
anything, take a look at Seifer's Draw list --> Cura! This will help you heal
yourself without wasting Healing class magic from your stock and thus making
your junctions less effective.

And when defeated...

Seifer: 'I...lost...!?'

OK, we took care of Seify boy. Now who's next...? Gulp.

Rinoa: 'I can fight if I'm with you!'
'That's why I'm here!'
Irvine: 'I have to redeem myself.'
Edea: '...The accursed SeeD.'

Noooo! Not Rinoa again. Sigh. Oh well, deal with it for now. Edea's main weapon
is (not-so)-vast array of magic spells - Blizzaga, Thundaga and Firaga. Now
think... We drew Flares before from Diablos and we put Flares onto El.Def.J
along with Protect magic. Kachink! No damage to your members if you spread out
GFs with relevant abilities correctly (hint hint nudge nudge at my
suggestions).

What? You don't have that? Sigh, what were you doing? Oh well, here's what you
do in these cases...
a) Have Squall junction Drain on St.Att.J (you have either no GFs with such
ability yet or you have four GFs with this ability so far - Siren card TOP
TIP!). Each attack Squall makes will deal damage to enemy and restore the same
amount of HP to Squall's HP. Bettered strategy - have Squall use Darkside
command for killer damage. This strategy is suitable for both Seifer and Edea.
b) If you don't have Drain, you'll have to rely on magic again. Edea's Draw
list has Cura (heal HP of members in need) as well as Life (revive KO-ed
members) for you to draw.
c) Have one member continuously cast Reflect on somebody and Edea will be
wasting her turns casting Dispel on member under Reflect.:)

If Edea manages to kill one member...

Edea: 'SeeD! Is that all you've got?'
'How boring...'

And when you finally defeat her...

Edea: 'Impudent SeeDs!'

Vict... Ooops, sorry, no such thing now.:) Anyway, you've won! Congratulations!

--------------------
#803 - BOSS STRATEGY
--------------------

Biggs: 'I was demoted because of you!'
'I'm only a liutenant now!'
'I'll get my revenge!'

... I'm speechless. And not afraid of you.:P
To get things heated up, for starters do the following --> put Silence and
Darkness on both Biggs and Wedge to make them completely harmless.

First time Wedge is attacked...
Wedge: 'O-Ouch!'
'They're always trouble...'

This fight is also last easy chance for your members to stock up on good spells
and here they are... Biggs: Regen and Haste! Wedge: Shell, Protect and Reflect!
Did you remember to put Draw onto your battle Command box??? No? Aww, that's
too bad then, you'll miss out on good opportunity.
You can Mug 1x Regen Ring from Biggs and 1x Strength Love from Wedge. Or don't
Mug them at all and choose to receive 3x Elixir and 8x Remedy.

For fun cast Confuse on Wedge and he'll attack Biggs.:)
Biggs: 'You idiot! What are you doing!'
Wedge: 'Yikes! What was I doing!?'

Cast Confuse on Biggs...
Wedge: 'Stop pickin' on us!'

Why? You're fun to pick on.:)

As Biggs' HP is depleted...
Biggs: 'We're just getting started.'

Now he'll start using Cure, Thundara, Slow, Haste and Regen. Pretty formiddable
foe at once, eh?:) Too bad he's under Silence and can't pull any of the stuff
of.:)

Defeat Biggs...
Biggs: 'What's the rank below liutenant...?' LOL.:)

As Wedge's HP is depleted...
Wedge: 'I don't wanna be demoted!'
Wedge: Wedge is pissed off! (his physical attacks become stronger)

Defeat Wedge...
Wedge: 'W-Why?'

What to do before encountering next boss???

1. SAME TOP TIP!!! AGAIN:P
If you don't have any Silences, Blinds and such, it would be a good idea before
the fight now to check that GF abilities you've learned so far. Expand your
knowledge of the game. Many useful magics can be gotten from items, you just
have to check it.:)

2. Crap. Biggsmeister sounded the alarm... oh well. Try to fight GIM52A and Mug
few Missiles from him. Use 1x Missile on Quistis to have her learn Micro
Missiles Blue Magic.

3. All the way down in Desert Prison on floor 1 there is Combat King 001
magazine for Zell.

4. TOP TIP!!! (boring one, I'm afraid...)
Are you a patient card player that *doesn't give up easily*? Then this tip is
for you! Challenge the card player on 11th floor (pay 200 Gil per card game).
Why should you do that, cos it seems that all he gives you are crappy Potions?
Very rarely it can happed that you may receive Rosetta Stone, very useful item
that teaches a GF Abilityx4. Cool! Having four character abilities already at
start of disc 2? Tres cool!!! Of course, you have to persevere in playing this
guy. If you have a life (which I obviously don't:D), try to nab 3x Rosetta
Stone before you move on.
This is totally optional stuff to be done! If you don't wanna be bothered, then
move on. I'll do my best in providing you with info that will help you get thru
bosses victoriously.

#903 - BOSS STRATEGY
--------------------

Elite Soldier: 'You're not goin' anywhere!'

[Squall: 'Pardon me, but I think I am... and your two cars are in my way.
Please remove them at your earliest convenience.']

Ouch. Elite Soldier suddenly knows a lot of moves. Yikes. Aura, Shell, Protect,
Curaga, Meltdown... why only in this fight and no others? Oh well, we'll never
know. Absolutely go after Elite Soldier first to eliminate his attempts of
casting positive statuses on GIM52As. He has the lowest HP of the trio.

If either GIM52A gets Aura status (it'll cause him to deal higher physical
damage), Dispel it. If you don't have any Dispels, check the Draw list of any
enemy. Dispel! So Draw and cast it on affected GIM52A. Don't be a hero in this
fight. GIM52A has a dangerous Micro Missiles move, knocking off 50% of
targetted member's HP (25% if under Protect and 0% if under Defend). If your HP
gets too low, heal immediately. If you brought Quistis, then lower HP is not
necessarily a bad thing. Degenerator, anyone?:)

Ray Bomb move by GIM52A is very rarely used, as well as Thundaga (have Thunder
class magic on El.Def.J to deal with this). Put Quake or Water on El.Att.J to
waste GIM52As faster.

Victory Fanfare! Congratulations!

[Squall: 'Because you didn't remove your vehicles, I took the liberty of
removing them myself.']

What to do before encountering next boss???

1. TOP TIP!!!
Alright! We're out of that annoying D-Prison. Head for Deling first. Go into
Caraway's mansion and challenge him to a card game. Lose Ifrit's card to him.
In his next hands it is possible that Rinoa's card may pop up. Grab it!

2. Levels, levels, levels...
If you haven't visited Lallapalloza Canyon yet, now is the good chance. You're
very near it. Fight Vysages there for 1 level up per one Vysage fight.

3. Visit Deling's Junk Shop to upgrade your weapons if you haven't done so
already.

4. Suggested party to send to Missile Base would be Selphie, Rinoa and Irvine.

---------------------
#1003 - BOSS STRATEGY
---------------------

Base Leader: 'Time for us to get serious!'

Haven't I heard that sometime before? Luckily for you the bozos in this battle
can be inflicted with various status abnormalities.:) You should especially
concentrate on Silencing Base Leader, or else he might throw Confuse at you
(did you put Confuse on St.Def.J?).

Base Leader: 'Are they from Garden?'

Nice conclusion. I'm afraid I'll have to kill you now that you uncovered our
identities.:) It's a good idea to waste Base Leader first, as he knows Cura and
it's tiresome to waste turns depleting HP that was already depleted before
(confused? I certainly am.:)). He also has the lowest HP of the bunch. On the
other note, these guys tend to waste their turns a lot by using Remedies if
they're inflicted with various status abnormalities. Use statuses to your
advantage.

Base Soldier: 'Captain, they're too strong!'
Base Leader will start using Cura now.

Plaster left Base Soldier...
Base Soldier: 'C-Captain...'
Base Leader: 'My men! How dare you?'
I'm sorry... geez. It was self defense, I tell ya.

Kill right Base Soldier...
Base Soldier: 'Ughhh...'
Base Leader: 'My men! How dare you?'
... I don't know what to say to this gem of yours...

These guys don't have any smart spells to Draw - maybe Reflect and Confuse can
spark your interest. Otherwise just kill them.

Special 'moves':
1. 'Standby for beam cannon!' --> NT 'move' --> when this (and some other
messages) pops up, this is a sign for you --> warning that boss' next move will
be Beam Cannon
CM --> None... except killing BGH251F2 before he uses it?:)

---------------------
#1103 - BOSS STRATEGY
---------------------

Okay, okay, I'll get to it now.:) If you're prepared for it (and by reading my
suggestions, you should:)), then this battle will be a cinch.

Well, it's time to show this behemoth who's the meaner guy. Start the battle by
physically attacking the boss until it gets blinded. Voila, that takes care of
that annoying (Chaingun fire). If you want to be on the safe side, Draw and
Cast Protect on your party members. Don't bother casting Shell, as it's useless
in this fight!

After boss takes three turns (exactly three turns!) in doing (Chaingun fire)
move, you will see either of the following messages appear on the screen...

Quote 1 -- Captain: 'Stand by for beam cannon!'
Private 1: 'Yes, sir!'
Quote 2 -- Private 2: 'Setting target!'
Quote 3 -- Captain: 'Shoot 'em again!'

This is a 'warning' move, ie next move the boss will use is Beam Cannon. The
only way to lower the damage done by it is by Defend command (cuts the damage
by 50%). Also, when you see this message appear and if by any chance any of
your members is on low HP, heal that member immediately.

Okay, so you're healed and ready to take the punishment. BAM! One Beam Cannon
less.:) Remember, Beam Cannon ignores Shell status! Now boss will again use 3x
(Chaingun fire) move in a row before using Beam Cannon again. This goes on and
on and on...

If you successfully blind the boss, the only move you should be worried about
is Beam Cannon.:) So use the freebies during the time boss is busy (Chaingun
fire)-ing you to inflict severe damage on the boss.

Note: Remember not to forget to heal if needed if by chance you can't defeat
the boss fast enough before he uses Beam Cannon for the second time and
onwards...

Boss nears its defeat by the number of turrets that keep blowing up as you
deplete its HP. You know so by the following quotes:
Destroy 1st turret -- Private 2: 'AHHH! Captain!'
Captain: 'It's only one, don't worry!'
Destroy 3rd turret -- Private 2: 'Let's just get outta here!'
Captain: 'Can't let them seize this MRV!'
Destroy 4th turret -- Private 1: 'I can't control it!'
Captain: 'What!!!?'

Congrats, you just wasted BGH251F2.:) Ooops, what's that? The fight is not over
yet... You will be greeted by 1x Elite Soldier and 2x G-Soldier, which pose no
real threat really.:)

Captain: 'AWWW HOT HOT HOT!'
Private 2: 'What now, Captain?'
Private 1: 'It needs repairs, sir!'
Captain: 'We'll kill 'em first!'

Just kill them fast and painless.:D

Victory Fanfare! Congratulations!

What to do before encountering next boss???

1. Magic - and a good one that is.:)
a) When fighting Granaldo in Infirmary hallway and if Granaldo is at a high
enough level, you can Draw Pains from it! Don't miss this chance!!!
b) When in MD Level, Draw Flares from high level Tri-Faces (Put Sleep on
St.Att.J)! Don't miss this chance!!!

2. TOP TIP!!!
There's also a Bomb battle in one of B-Garden's hallways. If Bomb's level is 30
or higher, there's a slight chance that you might Mug it for Bomb Spirit - use
it to teach a GF of your choice Kamikaze command, an excellent desperation
choice in those annoying boss fights, when the boss just won't go down.:)
Damage done to the boss when using Kamikaze is MAX HP of Kamikaze pilot x 5 (ie
multiplied by five) and it can deal critical damage as well. Example: Squall
has 5000 MAX HP. Use Kamikaze and you can expect either 25000 HP or 50000 HP
(!) of damage.
Note: Damage done can't exceed 60000 HP.

3. TOP TIP!!!
Make Tri-Face encounters to be your benefit. Mug them for either 6x Curse Spike
or in rare case 8x Curse Spike. Nab 100x Curse Spike and use Siren's Tool-RF to
convert them into 1x Dark Matter (Siren HAS to be Lv 100 prior being able to do
that, tho'. Dark Matter teaches Quistis Shockwave Pulsar, the strongest Blue
Magic - damage done by it can exceed 9999 HP limit as well.

#1203 - BOSS STRATEGY
---------------------

Time for the showdown. I expected these guys to have a joined move like Iguions
did, but luckily they don't have it, hehe. Oilboyles are dangerous in other
fields tho'! They can blind you and bestow Curse upon you, thus disabling your
limit breaks.

Cheese way No. 1: If you have Quistis in your party, simply cripple her into
yellow and use her Degenerator to subdue the bosses, heheh.
Cheese way No. 2: Attack them physically with Sleep junctioned to St.Att.J.
They're very vulnerable to Sleep status. Now, who said they were dangerous?
Cheese way No. 3: Shockwave Pulsar, anyone?
Cheese way No. 4: Kamikaze, anyone?

Well, in case you can't do any of the above cheese ways, you're in for a
challenging fight (remember to put Fire class spells on El.Att.J!). First cast
Protect on your members, if you wish. You may also cast Shell, but you'd just
be wasting turns. Instead keep on attacking - a word of warning: Oilboyles are
somewhat fast.

If you don't have any St.Def.J (but you really should have, as Status abilities
are really important) and you get Blinded, Draw and cast Esuna on affected
member - see, see, it just so happens that Oilboyles have Esuna. Oilboyles also
have Cura for you to draw.

Occassionaly one of them may use Sonic Wave, extremely annoying magical attack,
which deals damage to all targets and can inflict Curse. Counter this by
Drawing and casting Esuna on affected member/s... or rather go all out with
physical attacks. You don't really need Limit Breaks for this fight.

It seems to me that Oilboyles tend to start using Oil Blast counter move more
as they near their death if they get physically or magically attacked. So once
an Oilboyle's HP is at about 1/3 of it remaining, use something powerful to
take down that Oilboyle with a single attack - Shockwave Pulsar, Kamikaze,
anything.

Victory Fanfare! Congratulations!

What to do before encountering next boss???

1. CCGroup Quest!!!
a) Yep, this is the first point in the game when you can start CCGroup quest.
Primary thing to be done is to win at least 20 (or more, I think) card battles.
Then go to the B-Garden lobby and talk to the guy, who keeps mentioning CCGroup
to you. He'll reveal himself as Jack of CCGroup and challenge you to a card
game. Defeat him.
b) Then go to screen with paths leading to cafeteria, dormitory and garage.
Look for the guy that goes '.....' when you try talking to him. This is Club of
CCGroup. Challenge him and beat him.
c) Head for B-garden lobby again. Wait for two girls that like to talk one
after another to stop at the B-Garden map. It appears they're Diamond duo of
CCGroup. Beat them.
d) Also head for infirmary and challenge Kadowaki (former CCGroup King) to a
card game and beat her (her hand suddenly improves immensely:)).
e) These are all CCGroup members you can beat so far.

---------------------
#1303 - BOSS STRATEGY
---------------------

NORG: 'BLUE-YELLOW-RED.'
'LOTS-OF-MAGIC-WHEN-RED!'
'AS-LONG-AS-COLOR-STAYS,'
'I-WILL-ATTACK-SeeD-WITH-MAGIC.'

Talkative, aren't we? Well, time to shut you up for good.
Note: Left and Right Orb can't be destroyed no matter what you do.

When some turns take place...
NORG: 'Bujurururu...'

Speak more clearly! For starters Mug Left Orb for few Mag Up-s and Right Orb
for few Spr Up-s. Also be careful of either orb turning red. If it does, it's
no biggie... if you're junctioned properly, you can take the pain.:) It's funny
when Right Orb tries to Dispel Auto-Reflect status, but it'll miss.:)
Always make sure that the member who has Treatment on is protected against
statuses that boss can use against you (you'll know which by reading this here
FAQ:)).
Well, once you steal those items from Orbs, destroy NORG Pod. Since it doesn't
attack, it's easy. Once the Pod is history, NORG himself steps onto the field.

NORG: 'DAMN-THOSE-SeeDS!'
'THIS-IS-MY-GARDEN!'
'YOU-CAN'T-DO-AS-YOU-PLEASE!'

Better watch it or I'll stuff those words down your throat. First thing to do
is to Draw Leviathan!!! You just can't miss him... you can't afford to miss
him. Doing this will take away NORG's ability to cast Water - instead he'll now
start using Blizzara, Slow, Silence and Protect... hmmm, nothing majorly
dangerous. Mug NORG for 1x Circlet.
If you're tired with NORG, you can just use Kamikaze on him and he'll die of
painful death.:) Err, okay not really, hehehe. Truthfully, NORG is not hard.
With right junctions (heck, even if one member is junctioned properly, you can
win any battle!) the victory is yours guaranteed.

NORG: 'I'M-DONE-FOR!'
'I'M-AFRAID-OF-YOU!'
'ME-WHY-ME...?'

CCGroup. Beat them.
d) Find Spade (the guy at beginning of the game who gave you seven cards) and
challenge him to the card game. Defeat him. One more CCGroup member is behind
you.
e) You may head for infirmary and challenge Kadowaki (former CCGroup King) to a
card game and beat her (her hand suddenly improves immensely).
e) These are all CCGroup members you can beat so far.

2. Here's the recommended order in which it is advised to have Leviathan learn
his abilities...
a) Leviathan - Spr-J (absolutely learn this first, as it offers 3rd Spr-J
junction so far and you need it badly), Spr+20%, Spr+40%, Spr Bonus, Supt Mag-
RF, Recover, El.Att.J, Auto-Potion, GFRecov Med-RF

------------------------
#1402 - BGH251F2'S MOVES
------------------------

1. (Chaingun fire) --> ST no-name PA
CM --> Higher Vit, Protect status, Defend status, put Darkness on BGH251F2
2. Beam Cannon --> ST No-element class MA --> unlike in first fight, Beam
Cannon is now a really crappy attack - it does crap damage and can be
countermeasured with Shell
CM --> Higher Spr, Shell status, Defend status

---------------------
#1403 - BOSS STRATEGY
---------------------

Zell: 'We got a big one on our hands!'
Quistis: 'Galbadia's latest weapon.'
Squall: 'Let's destroy this thing!'

Well, it's time to show this iron crap that if you mess with the best, that
means you'll die like the rest. Start the battle by physically attacking the
boss until it gets blinded. Voila! The boss can't touch you again.:)
Furthermore, Beam Cannon now cannot ignore Shell - even more, you don't even
have to bother Shelling your members, as Beam Cannon does crap damage to
targetted member. Further insult brings the fact that BGH251F2 has even less HP
than when you fought it in Missile Base.
Don't forget to Mug the boss for 1x Adamantine (in case you don't have a big
supply of those already, hehehe:)).
Boss on Darkness, Beam Cannon's crap damage, less HP - Victory, anyone?;)

You just wasted BGH251F2. Again! Ooops, what's that? The fight is not over
yet... Again! Just kidding... prepare for a surprise.

Victory Fanfare! Congratulations!

What to do before encountering next boss???

1. Magic!!!

a) Meteor - go to Centra continent and visit the forests near Edea's house.
Rarely you may run into Ruby Dragons there. If they're Lv 45+, you may Draw
Meteor from them (put Sleep on St.Att.J)
b) Flare - see above
c) Pain - high-level Ochus have this magic
d) Full-Life - see boss strategy #D
e) Meltdown - visit Trabia continent and encounter Gaylas. If at high enough
levels, you will be able to Draw Meltdown from them
f) Triple - see boss strategy #C
g) Death - visit Centra Ruins and Draw Death magic from Tonberries
h) Haste - refine this magic from Lightweights
i) Quake - Draw from high level T-Rex
j) Tornado - Draw from high level Thrustaevises
k) Ultima - 5 grans Draw Point at Shumi Village will let you stock up on these
l) Aura - defeat Blue Dragon for Fury Fragments. 1x Fury Fragment refines into
5x Aura with Leviathan's Supt Mag-RF.

There. These are all magics you can get NOW to make your junctions top-notch
and make your characters ones to be afraid of.

2. Cards!!!

a) Read previos 'Special Advertisement' to learn how to start CCGroup quest.
Now is your chance to finish it for good...
--> CCGroup Queen: Do you wonder who the queen is?:) Talk to Xu - whoa!
Challenge her to a card game and win! But wait! She also has Carbuncle card.
Make sure you don't forget to steal it.;)
--> CCGroup King: OK, now you have to be patient a bit. Go to Squall's room,
stand next to the bed and choose any two of upper options. Wait until screen
goes dark. If it becomes bright again (ie next day - kinda, heh), try again.
Keep trying and eventually King will show up... WHAAAT? King will challenge
you. Win! But wait! King also has Gilgamesh card - THE card you should be
looking for. King will play you from now on only in Garden's Cockpit. So go
there and challenge the King for so long until you get Gilgamesh card.
--> CCGroup Joker: He's found in Training Center. He randomly appears at the
pier. Challenge him and win - he will upgrade Battle Meter (if you have it,
that is). But wait! He also has Leviathan card, which of course you should
steal.
b) Mayor Dobe should now hold Quezacotl card.
c) Defeat Odin at Centra Ruins to receive Odin card.

3. TOP TIP!!!

Now I guess you already have a bunch of powerful cards, which means it'd be a
good time to mod some of these into items, that will make your progress
easier...
IMPORTANT - Only cards you should keep for further playing are: Minotaur,
Ifrit, Seifer and Diablos and some random Lv6 or Lv7 boss card (we'll waste
Sacred and MiniMog for some other purpose). Safely mod all of the rest in
following...
a) Zell --> 3x Hyper Wrist (Str+60%)
b) Quistis --> 3x Samantha Soul (Triples)
c) Leviathan --> 3x Doc's Code (Med Data)
d) Carbuncle --> 3x Glow-Curtain (Auto-Reflect)
e) Gilgamesh --> 10x Holy War
f) Angelo --> 100x Elixir
g) Rinoa --> 3x Magic Armlet (Spr+60%)
h) Siren --> 3x St. Atk. (St.Att.J) --> Use 1x St. Atk. item on Quezo (in case
you've gotten Siren card now - in my case I've taught Quezo, Shiva and Ifrit
St.Att.J cos I got Siren card way earlier)

4. TOP TIP!!!

How to get last ditch rescue? Obtain Phoenix Pinion - and Phoenix may come to
your rescue sometimes.
a) Phoenix Pinion can be found in Winhill by kicking small chocobo a few times
(it will say that you got Phoenix Down, but check your inventory and you'll see
that you receieved Phoenix Pinion).
b) One Phoenix Pinion may be gotten by temporarily completing Shumi Village
quest.
c) Do you have 3x Mega Phoenix? Use Siren's Tool-RF and refine 3x Mega Phoenix
into 1x Phoenix Pinion.

Now that you have Phoenix Pinion in your possession, use it in any battle. From
now on, when all of your membere are defeated, ie KO-ed, there is a small
probability that you can be revived by Rebirth Flame.

5. Complete Quistis' Blue Magic list!!!

By now the only thing missing on Quistis' Blue magic list is Ray Bomb. Hmmm,
where can you get a Power Generator?
Head for Centra continent and engage Blitzes there. At high levels there is a
rare possibility that you may Mug Blitz for 1x Power Generator.
Here's the info on where can you get the remaining Blue Magics in case you
missed some and you don't want to be bothered by cards...
Name - Item required - Enemy to be encountered - Level of usefulness (1 being
the crappiest, 5 being the best)
a) Ultra Waves - Spider Web - Caterchipillar - 1
b) Electrocute - Coral Fragment - Creeps, Cockatrice - 1
c) Lv? Death - Curse Spike - Forbidden, Malboro - 2
d) Degenerator - Black Hole - Gesper (I suggest modding its card into 1x Black
Hole or Diablos card into 100x Black Hole), Wendigo - 5
e) Aqua Breath - Water Crystal - Fastitocalon-F, Fastitocalon - 2
f) Micro-Missiles - Missile - GIM52A (you have to wait a bit), Death Claw - 4
g) Acid - Mystery Fluid - Gayla - 2
h) Gatling Gun - Running Fire - SAM08G (but you have to wait a bit) - 2
i) Fire Breath - Inferno Fang - Ruby Dragon, Hexadragon - 2
j) Bad Breath - Malboro Tentacle - Malboro (Grandidi Forest!) - 5
k) White Wind - Whisper - Adamantoise - 5
l) Homing Laser - Laser Cannon - Elastoid, Belhelmel - 2
m) Mighty Guard - Barrier - Behemoth (I'd suggest going after 10 of its cards!)
- 5
n) Shockwave Pulsar - Dark Matter (need 100x Curse Spike and Lv100 Siren) -
Malboro, Forbidden - 5

6. TOP TIP!!!

Have some GFs whose abilities take forever to learn and you don't want to wait
for so long or don't have a life (like me?:)). Fear not, for there is an enemy
that will make your life way faster.
a) With your mobile B-Garden head for Centra and go as close as you can to
desert area (Kashkabald Desert). Get off, go thru the canyon too small for
Garden to pass thru and make your way as close as you can to a small island on
which a funny green thing keeps popping out of the ground. In your menu it will
now read Esthar - Cactuar Island.
b) Have Squall and Selphie (have her Strange Vision) on your team with a third
one that has Diablos junctioned (high Hit-J!). Also junction Water to El.Att.J
and Sleep to St.Att.J.
c) Everything you'll fight there is Cactuars and more Cactuars.
d) Cactuars have very high Evade stat, but they can't escape 255% Hit rate.:)
And if Str-J of your members is high (recall magic tips from this section), one
Cactuar will go down with one hit.
e) Each defeated Cactuar nets you 20 AP!!! So go on a killing spree!
f) Watch those AP come together in no time. Also make sure that you drop by
this area often when you obtain new GFs in the future.

7. UFO!

a) Enter Kash Desert as this is the second area where UFO will appear.
b) Enter Winhill Bluffs as this is the third area where UFO will appear.
c) This is as much as you can do for UFO quest.

8. NEW MYSTERIOUS GF...

... for which you need 666 items...
a) 6x Malboro Tentacle --> Mug or defeat Malboro for a few of them
b) 6x Steel Pipe --> Wendigos are your best friends.
c) 6x Remedy+ --> Just nab together 60x Remedy. Why? Wait until disc 3.
d) Mystery item --> What is it? You'll have to wait until disc 3.

9. STATUS ATTACK!

If you still don't have Siren card, now is a good time to do so. Refer to
'Special advertisement' section before 'BOSS FIGHT #B'. Mod the card into 3x
St.Att. item.

10. BONUSING AND LEVELING AT THE SAME TIME!!! TOP TIP!!!

Ifrit's Str Bonus, Brothers' HP Bonus, Carbuncle's Vit Bonus, Leviathan's Spr
Bonus - what is so special about those? Here.
Choose three members to level up - I'd go with Irvine, Zell and Squall for now.
Then KO Zell and Squall and go for Lallapalloza Canyon where Vysages lurk -
these are greatest EXP givers so far. Junction Ifrit, Bros, Carbuncle and
Leviathan to Irvine and let the games begin. Kill Vysage trios easy, fast and
painless with Irvine's Flame Shot limit break.

For each level up Irvine gains he will also gain:
--> additional +30 HP at each level up
--> additional +1 Str at each level up
--> additional +1 Vit at each level up
--> additional +1 Spr at each level up

And when he reaches Lv 100, you'll have your jaw drop on the floor when you
take a look at statistic values without anything junctioned to them.:)

Then complete the same sequence with Zell, Squall and Quistis.

If you don't want to be bothered by leveling up too much, I guess that about 30
or so levels for every of these four members will be okay - have each member
reach *at least* Lv 55.

JUNCTIONING SECTION!!!
++++++++++++++++++++++

I promised I'll make the game as easy as possible for you and the next section
deals in great depth with what you should waste your time, if you choose to do
so.

Here you will find the mucho needed info on what abilities should your GFs
learn by now. Enjoy this step by step guide.

Step 1 --> Go to Timber and visit Pet Shop there. Buy 100x Amnesia Greens.
Waste all the money on those if you have to.:)
Step 2 --> Use Amnesia Greens on your GFs and make them forget all GF HP+??%
abilities as well as all SumMag+??% abilities to make much needed space for new
abilities.
Step 3 --> We'll deal with following three GFs a bit closer: Quezo, Shiva,
Ifrit
Step 4 --> Make the three of them forget Magic, Draw, GF and Item abilities.
Why? Cos you'll use the slots for learning other more useful abilities,
silly.:)
Note: I'd get rid of Boost and El.Def.J as well.

1. Now it's time to specialize in character abilities that increase statistics.

A) STRENGTH
--> Card Mod Zell card in 3x Hyper Wrist
--> Hyper Wrist teaches GF Str+60% character ability
--> Use 1x Hyper Wrist on Quezo, 1x Hyper Wrist on Shiva, 1x Hyper Wrist on
Ifrit

B) VITALITY
--> Go fight Adamantoises at Long Horn island beaches or on the beaches on
Dollet continent. Do NOT Mug them or else you won't get Adamantines.
--> Adamantine teaches GF Vit+60% character ability
--> The least amount of Adamantines you'll need is three, but it is advised
that you get at least 10 (some member's best weapons require Adamantine)
--> Use 1x Adamantine on Quezo, 1x Adamantine on Shiva, 1x Adamantine on Ifrit

C) MAGIC
--> Personally I think this is a really useless stat, but anyway... you should
be looking for Royal Crowns
--> Right now (or better yet, in the near future) you can only get one measly
Royal Crown
--> Royal Crown teaches GF Mag+60% character ability
--> Defeat Tonberry King and it'll drop 1x Royal Crown
--> Use 1x Royal Crown on Quezo (as Quezo is junctioned to Quistis and she is
more of a magic user than the physical attacker)

D) SPIRIT
--> Card Mod Rinoa card into 3x Magic Armlet
--> Magic Armlet teaches GF Spr+60% character ability
--> Use 1x Force Armlet on Quezo, 1x Force Armlet on Shiva, 1x Force Armlet on
Ifrit

2. Now it's time to specialize in various helpful character abilities that
increase your odds against your adversaries

A) AUTO-REFLECT
--> Card Mod Carbucle card into 3x Glow Curtain
--> Glow Curtain teaches GF Auto-Reflect character ability
--> Use 1x Glow Curtain, 1x Glow Curtain on Shiva, 1x Glow Curtain on Ifrit

FINAL SETUP OF QUEZO'S, SHIVA'S AND IFRIT'S ABILITIES

This is a short recap of what abilities would these three GFs be advised to
have so far. I've taken the liberty of putting it down by numbers from 1 to 22

three are the same, except their special abilities.

This is it currently for this section type.:) More info and more tips will be
available later.

Note: From this boss fight onward I'll be writing specifically which GF holds
which ability that I'll be mentioning in one of boss' sections.

And finally I am finished. Phew. Drat, so much info and so not-much space. But
if this info will be of any help to you, then my purpose of writing this FAQ
will be complete.:)

Head for Centra Ruins now. Many mysteries await you there. And I'm here to
unveil them.:)

====================
BOSS FIGHT #C - ODIN
====================

Note: This is the fifth boss fight in which your levels come to play, ie boss'
levels will be affected by your levels.

Evaluation: Well, IMO Odin is a nuisance more then a help. I can't count the
amount of times Odin has appeared for me when I didn't want him to (trying to
Draw Meteors from Ruby Dragon). I strongly advise against getting Odin. But
that's just my opinion.
If you want an unreliable source of instant defeat for your enemies, then by
all means go ahead and kick Odin's ass.

--------------------
#C03 - BOSS STRATEGY
--------------------

So you're really going to waste Odin? Well, I'm here to assist you in doing
that. First of all, Odin doesn't attack you! Use the freebies you're given to
Draw Triples from Odin.:) Also stock up on Death if you haven't done so
already.
Mug Odin for 1x Luck-J Scroll (this item teaches GF Luck-J ability). Well,
apart from this stuff Odin is very easy. Just don't toy with him for too
long.;)

I don't know why but there's no Victory Fanfare after you defeat Odin. Anyway,
you've won! Congratulations.

Now feel the wrath of Odin coming out and slicing your enemies to half when you
at least want him to.:P

What to do before encountering next boss???

1. Okay, defeating Odin removes 20 minute timer at Centra Ruins and allows you
easier manipulation in obtaining your new GF, which just happens to be at the
Centra Ruins - again.:) Are you ready for a bit of boredom? But the award is
huge.

This next tip applies to you if you've wasted Odin.

2. Use Luck-J Scroll on Ifrit in order for him to learn Luck-J (as he's
junctioned to Squall in my game). You're totally free to use that item on
whatever GF you desire.

#D02 - KING TONBERRY'S MOVES
----------------------------

1. (Knife stab) --> ST no-name PA
CM --> Higher Vit, Protect status, Defend status
2. It's Sharp! --> ST Special class PA --> ignores Vitality and does damage to
single member by the following equation --> number of targetted member's killed
enemies multiplied by 30
CM --> Protect status, Defend status
3. Junk --> AT PA --> counterattack class move --> used by the boss whenever he
has been a target of either magical or physical attack for fifth, tenth,
fifteenth and so on time
CM --> Higher Vit, Protect status, Defend status

--------------------
#D03 - BOSS STRATEGY
--------------------

Note: It is advised that you bring members that haven't killed many enemies
yet, otherwise you may find yourself constantly reviving.;)

First of all, to get this guy to even appear, you have to waste around 20
Tonberries, which is a tough job to do, as Tonberries have huge amount of HP.
Anyway, once Tonberry King appears...
Absolutely cast Meltdown on it first. This guy has highest HP amount you ever
saw so far - whopping 250000 HP at Lv100. The lower its level, the lower HP
amount you'll have to deal with.
Squall and Zell (or Irvine) should be the attackers for this round. Squall
Renzokukening, Zell Punch Rushing and Booyaing, Irvine Armor Shoting (use Aura
Stones or Auras - for info on how to get those refer to 'Special Advertisement
before #C BOSS FIGHT).
Have Quistis be the medic for this fight. Have her use Defend and all Tonberry
King's attacks against her are now useless (as they're all physical attacks).
When Tonberry King knocks out either one of two members, have Quistis Draw and
cast Full-Life on KO-ed member, then have her use Defend again.
It's Sharp! will usually kill targetted member unless under Protect / Defend
status. However, if the targetted member has killed less than 334 enemies, then
he'll still survive (providing he has 9999 HP of course).
Junk is less (or more:)) powerful than It's Sharp!. Junk is used after Tonberry
King has been target of five actions and targets all members. Be under Protect
to halve the damage. By the way, gravity based attacks do not work on Tonberry
King and you're not able to Drain Tonberry King.
So basically - have the male members doing their limits, while Quistis is on a
stand-by (by Defend command) to heal KO-ed members when necessary and then
putting her under Defend again. If by a weird chance Quistis gets KO-ed, revive
her immediately.

Tonberry: 'I... I'm sorry.'
Tonberry joined your party!

Note: If it looks bad for you, you can escape the battle.:)

Victory Fanfare! Congratulations!

What to do before encountering next boss???

Alrighty! One (or two, if you're stubborn:)) new GF.

1. Here's the recommended order in which it is advised to have Tonberry learn
his abilities...
a) Tonberry - Initiative, Haggle, Sell-High, Familiar, Call Shop. Screw Move-HP
Up and Auto-Potion, as they're useless.

2. Now it's time to move on with storyline bosses...

#1502 - RAIJIN'S MOVES
----------------------

1. (Pole strike) --> ST no-name PA
CM --> Higher Vit, Protect status, Defend status, put Darkness on Raijin

---------------------
#1503 - BOSS STRATEGY
---------------------

Zell: 'You'll pay for this, Raijin!'

Easiest thing to do is to bestow Darkness upon all bosses and Silence upon G-
Soldiers. *wide grin* Who wants to mess with us now? Cast Meltdown on Raijin to
nullify his Vitality or else it'll take forever to waste him.
Be sure to Mug Raijin for 2x Str Up. Or if you choose not to, you will still
receive 1x Str Up once the fight ends (along with some crappy items that G-
Soldiers drop).
You can bypass healing needs by junctioning Drain to St.Att.J. Each time you
attack, you'll be healed.:) A nice tradeoff instead, wouldn't you agree? Plus
Darkside, which will deal 3x greater physical damage.

Raijin: 'Ughhh, you got me, ya know...'

Victory Fanfare! Congratulations!

#1602a - RAIJIN'S MOVES
-----------------------

1. (Pole strike) --> ST no-name PA
CM --> Higher Vit, Protect status, Defend status, put Darkness on Raijin
2. Hi-Potion --> ST Item class move that Raijin uses on himself when running
low on HP to restore 1000 HP --> counterattack class move
CM --> Defeat Raijin:)
3. Raijin Special --> ST PA --> used by Raijin when he's running low on HP -->
always deals critical damage to targetted member and always hits
CM --> Higher Vit, Protect status, Defend status, put Darkness on Raijin

----------------------
#1602b - FUJIN'S MOVES
----------------------

1. Tornado --> AT Wind class MA
CM --> Higher Spr, Shell status, Defend status, Wind class magic on El.Def.J
2. Aero --> ST Wind class MA
CM --> Higher Spr, Shell status, Reflect status, Defend status, Wind class
magic on El.Def.J
3. Zan --> ST PA --> even under Darkness, Fujin's hit rate is extremely high
CM --> Higher Vit, Protect status, Defend status
4. Sai --> ST Special class PA --> ignores Vitality and lowers HP of targetted
member to 1, always hits
CM --> None, except defeating Fujin
5. Remedy --> ST Item class move that Fujin uses either on herself or Raijin to
remove negative statuses done to them
CM --> None

---------------------
#1603 - BOSS STRATEGY
---------------------

Raijin: 'Time to get serious, ya know!?'

Easiest thing to do is to bestow Darkness upon both of them (it's harder to
Darkness Fujin, but it's possible) and thus nullifying their annoying physical
attacks (however, her Zan move seems to always hit). Fujin may use Remedy to
counter the negative statuses you've put on her or Raijin.
The fight usually starts by Fujin casting Tornado (take care of it and Aero by
junctioning Wind magic to El.Def.J). From then on she'll continuously cast Aero
or Tornado. Stop her from doing so by Drawing Pandemona!!! Now she'll start
using physical attacks - Zan and Sai. Be weary of her Sai, which lowers
targetted member's HP to 1 regardless of junctions. She'll start using Sai once
her HP is seriously low.
Most importantly, DRAW PANDEMONA! Also Mug Fujin for 1x Megalixir.
TOP TIP --> To bypass her stupid Sai, pummel on her until her HP is very low.
She'll still be casting Aero cos you haven't drawn Pandemona yet. So, when her
HP is in double or single digits, Draw Pandemona and finish her off.

Cast Meltdown on both Fujin and Raijin to nullify their Vitality.

Be sure to Mug Raijin for 2x Str Up. Or if you choose not, you will still
receive 1x Str Up once the fight ends.
Once Raijin's HP is about 2/3 depleted...
Raijin: 'Ouuuch! Not bad, ya know...'
... he'll use Hi-Potion on himself. But that just happens once, so it's no
biggie. Do not bother with summoning GFs nor casting magic - except if trying
to put a negative status upon boss/es or healing yourself.
You can bypass healing needs by junctioning Drain to St.Att.J. Each time you
attack, you'll be healed.:) A nice tradeoff instead, wouldn't you agree? And
couple this with Darkside command and...

Defeat Raijin first...
Raijin: 'Sorry, Fujin... they got me, ya...'
Fujin: 'I... DEFEATED...'

Defeat Fujin first...
Fujin: 'I... WITHDRAW. RAIJIN, GO.'
Raijin: 'Fujin, I lost too, ya know...'

What to do before encountering next boss???

Before heading for your next storyline boss (we'll waste another optional boss
first), it would be advised of you to do the following...

1. CARD QUEEN'S QUEST

Now it would be a good time to tackle this quest (since Galbadians have
retreated from Balamb). Go to Balamb's Train station and challenge the Card
Queen to card battle.
--> Make sure she uses All or Diff trading rule!!! If she doesn't, just say no
when prompted and retry.
--> Make sure you include Sacred and MiniMog in your playing hand along with
three other crappy cards.
--> Make sure you LOSE!!! I know you don't like giving away your powerful
cards, but it'll be well worth it in the end.
--> Card Queen will take both Sacred and MiniMog.
--> She will now say something about moving to a new area. If she says Dollet,
yes! If anywhere else, reset and try again.
--> Go to Dollet and enter the pub. Enter second floor. Looksie! Card Queen.
Chat with her and she'll mention that two new cards have been created - Kiros
and Irvine. Your new primary targets!
--> Kiros card: Go to Deling and enter Shopping Arcade. There's a man in black
whom you should challenge to a card game as he's holding Kiros card. Win it!
--> Irvine card: Go to FH. Enter Mayor's house and challenge Flo to a card game
as she's holding Irvine card. Win it! While you're here, also challenge Dobe
and
win Quezacotl card from him.

2. CARDS!!!

--> Balamb Hotel's owner now holds Pandemona card. Challenge him to a card game
and be sure to squeeze it from him.
--> When you visit Trabia Garden, make sure that you challenge Selphie's friend
to a card game after the long story sequence at basketball yard is finished.
She holds Selphie card. Make sure you steal it for your modding purposes.
--> Little brat known as Card Queen's son now holds Sacred and MiniMog cards
for you to obtain back.

3. SHUMI QUEST... CONTINUED!!!

It takes some time, but I guarantee it's worth the effort. The prize you get is
1x Status Guard, your third most wanted status protection.:)

4. CHOCOBO FORESTS!

Complete Chocobo forest quest and receive Chicobo card. DO NOT mod it further,
cos we'll use it later on disc 3.

5. TOP TIP!!!

Now I guess you already have a new batch of powerful cards, which means it'd be
a good time to mod some of these into items, that will make your progress
easier...
IMPORTANT - Only cards you should keep for further playing are: Minotaur,
Sacred, Ifrit, Seifer and Chicobo. Mod all of the rest in following...
a) MiniMog --> 100x Pet House
b) Quezacotl --> 100x Dynamo Stone
c) Selphie --> 3x Elem. Guard (El.Def.Jx4)
d) Kiros --> 3x Accelerator (Auto-Haste)
e) Irvine --> 3x Rocket Engine (Spd+40%)
f) Odin (if you wasted him) --> 100x Dead Spirit
g) Pandemona --> 100x Windmill

6. Here's the recommended order in which it is advised to have Pandemona learn
his abilities...
a) Pandemona - Spd-J, Initiative, Spd+20%, Spd+40%, Str+20%, Str+40%,
El.Def.Jx2. Screw Absorb as it's useless.

++++++++++++++++++++++
JUNCTIONING SECTION!!!
++++++++++++++++++++++

I promised I'll make the game as easy as possible for you and the next section
deals in great depth with what you should waste your time, if you choose to do
so.

Here you will find the mucho needed info on what abilities should your GFs
learn by now. Enjoy this step by step guide.

For starters use some Amnesia Greens and make Quezo forget El.Def.Jx2 - same
goes for Shiva and Ifrit.

1. It's time to specialize in various helpful character abilities that increase
statistics

A) SPEED
--> Card Mod Irvine card into 3x Rocket Engine
--> Rocket Engine teaches GF Spd+40% character ability
--> Use 1x Rocket Engine on Quezo, 1x Rocket Engine on Shiva, 1x Rocket Engine
on Ifrit

2. It's time to specialize in various helpful character abilities that increase
your odds against your adversaries

A) AUTO-HASTE
--> Card Mod Kiros card into 3x Accelerator
--> Accelerator teaches GF Auto-Haste character ability
--> Use 1x Accelerator on Quezo, 1x Accelerator on Shiva, 1x Accelerator on
Ifrit

3. It's time to specialize in various helpful junction abilities that will
allow you to improve your magic junctions

A) ELEMENTAL DEFENSE JUNCTION X 4
--> Card Mod Selphie card into 3x Element Guard
--> Element Guard teaches GF El.Def.Jx4 junction ability
--> Use 1x Element Guard on Quezo, 1x Element Guard on Shiva, 1x Element Guard
on Ifrit

B) STATUS DEFENSE JUNCTION X 4
--> You have one Status Guard so far
--> Status Guard teaches GF St.Def.Jx4 junction ability
--> Use 1x Status Guard on any GF except Siren or Carbuncle - I recommend
Quezo, as it is junctioned to Quistis in my game (and she doesn't have any
St.Def.J)

FINAL SETUP OF QUEZO'S, SHIVA'S AND IFRIT'S ABILITIES

--------------------
#E03 - BOSS STRATEGY
--------------------

Quistis: 'I don't think G Garden uses GF.'
Zell: 'Do people here know GF?'
Irvine: 'Never knew about this one.'
Rinoa: 'Mr. GF, give us your power!'
Selphie: 'Is this a GF!?'
Squall: 'Ahh... let's just take it.'
Cerberus: '... PRETTY CONFIDENT.'
'LET'S SEE HOW YOU DO.'

Blah blah blah.
Cerberus has a wide array of moves at his disposal. Do not be afraid of him, he
is not that tough. Always have a member on standby (in my case Quistis) and
watch what Cerberus is using. If he casts Triple on himself, have Quistis (or
whoever else) cast Dispel on Cerberus.
Under Triple Cerberus will be using Thundaga, Dispel, Silence and Blind and
critical (Tail whip).
If not under Triple, you're looking at Berserk, Quake, Tornado and (Tail whip).
As you can see, all of his moves can be rendered useless by junctioning
correctly - I think I covered most aspects of what to junction so that the only
damage you'll take is that of (Tail whip). Put Drain on St.Att.J (combine this
by using Darkside command!) and healing your characters is taken care of.
Mug Cerberus for 1x Spd-J Scroll!!!
Draw Triples from Cerberus!!! If you're junctioned correctly, he can't even
touch you - well, he can, but only by (Tail whip).

So to recap... Quake and Tornado can be absorbed (by Quake and Tornado on
El.Def.J). To nullify Berserk, have Berserk on St.Def.J. Have Drain on
St.Att.J. Have one member with Dispel on standby. Draw Triples like no
tomorrow. Mug 1x Spd-J Scroll. Cast Dispel whenever Cerberus uses Triple on
himself. Then most moves Cerberus will use will be trying to cast Triple on
himself.:) When satisfied, defeat him.

When you knock off about half of his HP...
Cerberus: 'SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT!'

Well, fulfill his wish and kick his ass.

Cerberus: 'NOT BAD... MORTALS.'

Even when defeated, you dare to mock me?

Victory Fanfare! Congratulations!

SPECIAL ADVERTISEMENT!!!

What to do before encountering next boss???

Alrighty! One new GF and soon we get 12th one.

1. Here's the recommended order in which it is advised to have Cerberus learn
his abilities...
a) Cerberus - Spr-J, Spd-J, St.Def.J, St.Def.Jx2, St.Def.Jx4, Mag-J, St.Att.J,
Spd+20%, Spd+40%, Auto-Haste, Alert. Screw Expend2x-1, as it's useless.

++++++++++++++++++++++
JUNCTIONING SECTION!!!
++++++++++++++++++++++

I promised I'll make the game as easy as possible for you and the next section
deals in great depth with what you should waste your time, if you choose to do
so.

Here you will find the mucho needed info on what abilities should your GFs
learn by now. Enjoy this step by step guide.

1. It's time to specialize in various helpful junction abilities that will
allow you to improve your magic junctions.

A) SPEED
--> I really advise that you Mug Cerberus for 1x Spd-J Scroll
--> Spd-J Scroll teaches GF Spd-J junction ability
--> Use Spd-J Scroll on any GF except Pandemona or Cerberus

Note: You now have 2 GFs with Spd-J junction ability and 1x Spd-J Scroll. I
advise the following...
--> Put Pandemona on Squall
--> Put Cerberus on Zell
--> Use Spd-J Scroll on Quezo as it is junctioned to Quistis in my game

Now you finally have three characters that have:
1. HP-J
2. Str-J
3. Vit-J
4. Mag-J
5. Spr-J
6. Spd-J
7. Hit-J (Squall doesn't need it, and I know that Diablos and Cerberus are both
junctioned to Zell, who doesn't need double Hit-J and double Abilityx3, but
soon you get another GF, so just bare with me for a while)
8. El.Att.J
9. El.Def.Jx4
10. St.Att.J
11. St.Att.Jx4 (you only have two so far, one on Quezo - junctioned to Quistis,
and one on Cerberus - junctioned to Zell --> only Squall still needs
St.Def.Jx4, but St.Def.Jx2 will suffice so far)

FINAL SETUP OF QUEZO'S, SHIVA'S AND IFRIT'S ABILITIES

CM --> Defeat Seifer:)

---------------------
#1703 - BOSS STRATEGY
---------------------

Seifer: 'Let's go after them monsters!'

Ah, good ol' Seifer. He has some new moves, but nothing breath-taking. Take
care of Fira and Firaga by having Fire class magic on El.Def.J. Take care of
Demon Slice by having high Vit-J. Otherwise all he has left are (Sword swipe)
and Hi-Potion.:) This time around Seifer has crap items. Mugging gets you 8x
Mega-Phoenix and dropping gets you 8x Mega-Potion... yawn.

Strike Seifer a few times...
Seifer: 'Show me what you got.'
'I'll show you who's the better man!'

You or me? You're confusing me, doggone it...

After about half of his HP is gone...
Seifer: 'Ready to die, Squall?'
'Kneel before me!'
He will say this before using Demon Slice. This move can target any single
member. Damage can be halved by Protect status or even nullified by Defend
status.

After about 3/4 of his HP is gone...
Seifer: 'Is that all you got!?'
'I can't be beaten.'
He will start using Hi-Potion on himself. Oh well, no biggie... you can choose
toying around with him for a little longer.

After about all of his HP is gone...
Seifer: 'This can't be! Why!?'

No Victory Fanfare... dammit. But you've won! Congratulations!

What to do before encountering next boss???

Well, there's not really that much to do... except maybe go collect Curse
Spikes from Tri-Faces down in the lobby where you fought Cerberus. There's a
fixed encounter with Tri-Faces if you run around on the stairs (where
Cerberus' tail was waving before you challenged him).

---------------------
#1803 - BOSS STRATEGY
---------------------

Seifer: 'I'm the sorceress' knight.'
'You'll never...get past me.'

First you have to waste Seifer again. He is no threat, as he can only do Fira
and his poor (Sword swipe). But before you knock him out, Mug him for 1x Hero
or possibly 1x Holy War.

Seifer: 'I can't afford to lose.'

Excuse me, but I think you will.:)

Defeat Seifer...
Seifer: 'Ughaah!'
'... Damn, I'm disgraced.'

Now it's time to take care of Edea. She on the other hand has improved her
array of moves tremendously, but... she can't kill you actually.:) As long as
you're junctioned properly, you cannot die once you face off against Edea.

Edea: 'Defeated... useless fool.'
'Enough play. SeeDs must die!'

She'll start the battle by casting Maelstrom, annoying gravity based magical
attack. Be sure that you have Aura or Pain on St.Def.J, otherwise your members
will get Curse status. Most importantly, Maelstrom cannot kill you no matter
how many times is it used.
Edea's Death magic can be rendered useless by Death on St.Def.J. Pain on
St.Def.J will take care of Edea's Silence magic. If you don't have Pain,
Silence will suffice.
Blizzaga magic? Fira magic? Ice class magic / Fire class magic on El.Def.J
respectively. Dispel magic? Don't bother casting support class magic on you or
use this to your advantage --> have one or two members junction Auto-Reflect
character ability. Edea will waste many turns casting Dispel on such
member/s.:)
Slow magic? No biggie. Slow on St.Def.J or junction Auto-Haste. Reflect magic?
Don't bother Dispeling it...

Oh yeah, Edea is vulnerable to Sleep status.;)

BUT!!! In all this fighting, do not forget to Draw Alexander!!! Then you play
basketball with Edea as much as you want. Edea can be Mugged for 1x Royal
Crown, but why bother? Magic sucks... well, anyway, if you don't mug it, you
receive 1x Force Armlet after battle is over... Spr+40%? We already have Spr+
60%...

What was that again about boss being hard? Right junctions and SeeDs live to
see another day, hehehe.

However if you don't have any of this, then you're in for a tough fight... I
suggest having at least one member with Drain on St.Att.J and have that member
attack, attack, attack (preferably have him using Darkside - true, member'll
lose some HP, but they will be restored by Drain).

When Edea is defeated...
Edea: 'A...Ahhh...'

No Victory Fanfare... dammit. But you've won! Congratulations!

What to do before encountering next boss???

Alrighty! One new GF.

1. Here's the recommended order in which it is advised to have Alexander learn
his abilities...
a) Alexander - Revive, High Mag-RF, Med Data, Med LV Up, Spr-J, El.Att.J,
El.Def.Jx4. Spr+??% are kinda useless now...

2. If you need fast AP, head for Kashkabald Desert and fight Cactuars there.
Watch those AP roll in really fast.
--> If you haven't done so already, now is a good time to have Leviathan learn
his Recover ability which will be handy in next fight.:)

3. CARDS!!!
--> Challenge Edea at Edea's House to a card game. She holds Edea card, a
powerful card that must be in your inventory. Win it!
--> Give 'Girl Next Door' magazine to Zone at White SeeD Ship for free and
you'll receive Shiva card.

4. Now all three of your characters are able to hold 3 character abilities at
once.

5. If you haven't done so already, get Tonberry GF! It will prove invaluable
after next boss is defeated.

---------------------
#1903 - BOSS STRATEGY
---------------------

Squall: 'An undead monster...'
'Use recovery-related magic and items.'

I think I somehow already knew that, but thanks for reminding me.:)

This boss battle is a piece of cake - use Elixir, Megalixir or X-Potion on
Abadon (9999 HP of damage). Recover command will also do 9999 HP of damage.
Repeat any suggested action twice and boss goes the way of the stone.;)

If you don't have any of this, it'll be a bit harder. One thing tho': Have
Confuse at St.Def.J as Abadon loves to use it on your party when (Standing up).

Boss can be bestowed with Darkness. And also... what's this? Curaga to Draw?
How about casting it instead on Abadon? See, the game actually allows you to
play dirty, heheh. If you get Curse, Darkness, Silence, Blind of Confuse,
there's Esuna for you to draw.
Boss has set attack pattern. Three or four rounds of physical attacks, (Stand
up), three or four rounds of magical attacks, (Sit down), the pattern repeats
itself. Please note that Abadon's Vit and Spr are extremely high when (Standing
up). It's better not to even bother attacking him.

I think I covered everything... oh yeah, Mug 1x Power Wrist from Abadon.

Victory Fanfare! Congratulations!

What to do before encountering next boss???

1. CARDS!!!
--> Challenge Odine to a card game. He holds Ward card, a powerful card that
must be in your inventory. Win it!
--> Challenge Piet to a card game. He holds Alexander card, an important part
of Card Queen quest. How about winning it?:) DO NOT mod it yet, you need this
card badly.
--> Challenge Ellone to a card game. She holds Laguna card. What's so good
about it, you ask? It allows you to get 100x Hero!!! How can you NOT get it?:)

Only few more cards to go!

2. TOP TIP!!!

When in Esthar Shopping mall, continuously try to enter Cheryl's Shop. After 80
or so tries you'll get 1x Rosetta Stone. Who-hooo!

3. TOP TIP!!!

At the same place continuously try to enter Esthar Shop!!!. After 20 or so
tries you'll get in. It holds some good items for you to buy.:) You're
interested in 5x Elixir. Buy them, but do not use them!!!

4. 13TH GUARDIAN FORCE!

Visit Tear's Point and nab Solomon Ring there. Then use it. If you have 6x
Steel Pipe, 6x Remedy+ and 6x Malboro Tentacle...

5. Here's the recommended order in which it is advised to have Doomtrain learn
his abilities...
a) Doomtrain - St.Def.Jx4, El.Def.Jx4, Darkside, Forbid Med-RF, Auto-Shell.
Screw Absorb, as it's useless.

6. ROSETTA STONE ON WHOM?

Well, I'd say use Rosetta Stone on one of Squall's GFs. After all, Squall is
the character that will waste most bosses, so it'd be really helpful to make
space for one extra character ability.
--> Use Rosetta Stone on Ifrit.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
AAA - PERFECT JUNCTIONING SECTION, PART A
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The time has come to provide the best junctions now for three main party
members - Zell (or Irvine), Squall and Quistis.

--> For starters, change your GF setup into following one...

Squall --> Ifrit, Carbuncle, Leviathan, Pandemona, Doomtrain
Zell --> Siren, Shiva, Alexander, Cerberus
Quistis --> Quezo, Bros, Tonberry, Diablos

But Zell doesn't have HP-J now, you say... and I say he will have it soon.:)

--> Head for Esthar's Shopping mall and enter Pet Shop there. If you have
Tonberry's Familiar, it's party time. Buy as much Amnesia Greens as you can and
also buy 3x HP-J, 3x Str-J, 3x Vit-J, 3x Mag-J, 3x Spr-J.

--> Right now we'll again tamper with Quezo's, Shiva's and Ifrit's abilities...
a) Have Quezo forget HP-J, Vit-J and Mag-J
b) Have Shiva forget Str-J, Vit-J and Spr-J
c) Have Ifrit forget HP-J and Str-J

--> Now let's concentrate on three other GFs... in my case Leviathan, Siren and
Brothers
a) Have Leviathan learn HP-J, Str-J and Spr-J
b) Have Siren learn HP-J, Str-J, Vit-J and Spr-J
c) Have Brothers learn Vit-J and Mag-J

OVERVIEW

A) Squall

--> Carbuncle or Doomtrain take care of St.Att.J
--> Doomtrain takes care of St.Def.Jx4
--> Ifrit takes care of El.Att.J
--> Ifrit or Doomtrain take care of El.Def.Jx4

--> Quezo takes care of El.Att.J
--> Quezo takes care of El.Def.Jx4
--> Quezo has Spd-J
--> Diablos has Hit-J

I guess I don't need to feed you with info on whatever magics you need to
junction.:) Anyway, I'll still get to that point again in Part B... This is it
for Part A. Part B is coming up after next storyline boss/es are defeated.

After a looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong story sequence you
finally gain control of Squall again...

---------------------
#2003 - BOSS STRATEGY
---------------------

These guys are more of a nuisance than a real threat... if you're not
junctioned correctly, then they'll be more of a threat. Thundaga can be
absorbed by Thunder class magic on El.Def.J. Silence and Blind can be easily
countered by Pain on St.Def.J. Render BiteBite and (Punch) useless by putting
Darkness on boss or putting it to Sleep (Propagators are very vulnerable
against these statuses).
Heck, they're even vulnerable to instant death. Yep, Odin can actually slice
and dice a few Propagators up - not that I'm encouraging you to actually get
Odin.:) Or how about Lv Down-ing these annoying guys? Tonberry's commands work
wonders.

Items for mugging and dropped items are worth crap, so safely skip 'em.

Victory Fanfare! Congratulations! ... but you have to defeat Propagators in
matching colors successively, otherwise they'll keep getting back to life...

What to do before encountering next boss???

1. SIDEQUESTS, SIDEQUESTS AND MORE SIDEQUESTS

UFO SIDEQUEST FINISHING TOUCHES
--> Fly to Heath Peninsula island for fourth UFO encounter. Then fly to
Grandidi Forest and park Ragnarok above the Chocobo Holy Forest. Run around a
bit any you'll finally be able to fight UFO. Defeat it for 1x Aegis Amulet.
--> Fly to the area where B-Garden was originally. Run around the crater and
you'll encounter PuPu. Give him 5x Elixir and you'll receive 1x PuPu card. This
does it for this sidequest.
--> Use 1x Aegis Amulet on Shiva (as I did in my game) or whatever GF you
desire.

CARD QUEEN SIDEQUEST FINISHING TOUCHES
--> Well, just visit Card Queen again whereever she is. By now you should have
Alexander card and Chicobo card, next two cards that you should LOSE to Card
Queen.
--> Return to Dollet to get Alexander and Chicobo cards back from Card Queen's
son.
--> Pay a visit to B-Garden. On the bench in front of the library there is
sometimes a person sitting - he now holds Chubby Chocobo card. Challenge him to
a card game and win that card.
--> Presidential Aide in Esthar's Presidential Palace now holds Phoenix card. A
card game (victorious one, of course) will nab you this card.
--> Now lose Phoenix card to Card queen. Get Phoenix card back from Card
Queen's son in Dollet.
--> Pub owner in Timber now holds Doomtrain card. Be warned tho'. He is not
that strong of a player, but it may take forever for Doomtrain card to appear
in his hand. Just be persistent and eventually you'll get it. El finito!

OBEL LAKE SIDEQUEST FINISHING TOUCHES
A --> Get first stone from Mr. Monkey - but first you must throw a rock that
will skip many many times.
--> Second stone is on Mandy Beach.
--> Third stone is on Rinaul coast. Keep pressing action. First you'll pick up
five wrong stones, and 6th one will be right one.
--> Fourth stone is located at Galbadia continent on Monterosa Plateau
(somewhere above the waterfall). Keep pressing action and once you 'find a
bird', defeat 2x Thrustaevis and last rock is yours.
--> Visit Obel Lake again and talk to the shadow who will 'decipher' (in a
way:)) the rock for you.
--> Then visit Mordred Plains at Esthar continent and toy around with color-
faced rocks.:) Prize is 1x Three Stars.

B --> Get the shadow to tell you 'Take some time off at Eldbeak Peninsula.'
--> Visit the place (it's on Trabia continent) and you'll find a stone pillar
there - keep pressing action to find it. Yet again a puzzle...
--> Get 1x Luck-J Scroll on Minde Isle by pressing action when roaming around -
it's somewhere in the middle.
--> Use 1x Luck-J Scroll on Shiva (as I did in my game) or whatever GF you
desire.

2. CARDS ARE NOT GETTING AWAY THAT EASY!

--> Get PuPu card by feeding it 5x Elixir.
--> You'll obtain Chubby Chocobo, Phoenix and Doomtrain cards from Card Queen
quest - plus of course you'll try to get back Chicobo and Alexander.:)
--> Challenge Laguna to a card game and win Squall card from him.

3. ISLAND CLOSEST TO HELL VS ISLAND CLOSEST TO HEAVEN

This is an EXP heaven - all monsters fought here are at Lv100. A single
member's level up per one battle is a common thing here.
--> ICTHell is the western-most island on the world map
--> ICTHeaven is the most northeastern island on the world map (a bit north of
Grandidi Forest)
--> Also, equip Enc-None party ability. ICTH islands are rich with invisible
draw points containing Ultima, Triple, Meteor, Full-Life and Flare. So stock
'em up like no tomorrow.:) Junctioooooooons...
--> Before commencing battles here, it would be a good thing to kill next
optional boss Jumbo Cactuar!

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
BBB - PERFECT JUNCTIONING SECTION, PART B
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The time has come to provide the best junctions now for three main members:
- Zell (or Irvine), Squall and Quistis.

--> If you haven't done so already, get Tonberry now from Centra Ruins (quick
strategy: defeat around 20 Tonberries and then kill King Tonberry that will
show up thereafter).

--> Change the junctioned GFs like this...

Squall --> Ifrit, Carbuncle, Leviathan, Pandemona, Doomtrain
Zell --> Siren, Shiva, Alexander, Cerberus
Quistis --> Quezo, Bros, Tonberry, Diablos

But Zell doesn't have HP-J now, you say... and I say he will have it soon.:)

--> Head for Esthar's Shopping mall and enter Pet Shop there. If you have
Tonberry's Familiar, it's party time. Buy as much Amnesia Greens as you can and
also buy 3x HP-J, 3x Str-J, 3x Vit-J, 3x Mag-J, 3x Spr-J.

--> Right now we'll again tamper with Quezo's, Shiva's and Ifrit's abilities...
a) Have Quezo forget HP-J, Vit-J and Mag-J
b) Have Shiva forget Str-J, Vit-J and Spr-J
c) Have Ifrit forget HP-J and Str-J

--> Now let's concentrate on three other GFs... in my case Leviathan, Siren and
Brothers
a) Have Leviathan learn HP-J, Str-J and Spr-J
b) Have Siren learn HP-J, Str-J, Vit-J and Spr-J
c) Have Brothers learn Vit-J and Mag-J

OVERVIEW

A) Squall
--> Leviathan will now have all five basic stat junctions
--> Carbuncle or Doomtrain take care of St.Att.J
--> Doomtrain takes care of St.Def.Jx4
--> Ifrit takes care of El.Att.J
--> Ifrit or Doomtrain take care of El.Def.Jx4
--> Pandemona has Spd-J

B) ZELL / IRVINE
--> Siren will now have all five basic stat junctions
--> Siren takes care of St.Att.J
--> Cerberus takes care of St.Def.Jx4
--> Shiva takes care of El.Att.J
--> Shiva takea care of El.Def.Jx4
--> Cerberus has Spd-J
--> Cerberus has Hit-J

C) QUISTIS
--> Brothers will now have all five basic stat junctions
--> Quezo takes care of St.Att.J
--> Quezo takes care of St.Def.Jx4
--> Quezo takes care of El.Att.J
--> Quezo takes care of El.Def.Jx4
--> Quezo has Spd-J
--> Diablos has Hit-J

I guess I don't need to feed you with info on whatever magics you need to
junction.:) Anyway, I'll still get to that point again in Part B...

Now it's time for me to tell you what magics are best to junction to all of
these particular stats.
Note: I'll deal with Luck-J and Eva-J on disc four. Why? Cos I have a better
solution for your junctioning needs...

HP-J
--> Drop Holy here.
--> It boosts your HP by 3800 HP.
--> Draw Holy from Elnoyle or refine Holy from Holy Stone or Moon Stone.

Str-J
--> Drop Meteor here.
--> It boosts your Str by 75 points.
--> Draw Meteor from Lv50+ Ruby Dragons.

Vit-J
--> Drop Meltdown here.
--> It boosts your Vit by 80 points.
--> Draw Meltdown from Lv40+ Gaylas.

Mag-J
--> Drop Whatever you wish here... I don't consider this stat that important...
however...
--> Ultima raises Mag by 100, Triple by 70, Pain by 60, Meteor by 52 and Flare
by 44 points.
--> For Ultima refer below. Draw Pain from Ochu or Elnoyle.

Spr-J
--> Drop Reflect here.
--> It boosts Spr by 70 points.
--> Draw Reflect from Adamantoise.

Spd-J
--> Drop Haste here.
--> It boosts Spd by 50 points.
--> Draw Haste from Cactuars (put them to sleep first). Refine Haste from
Lightweight.

Eva-J
--> Drop Triple here.
--> Boost value is dependant a bit on what is junctioned to Spd-J.
--> Draw Triple from Odin. Refine Triple from Samantha Soul, Rocket Engine or
Three Stars.

Hit-J
--> Drop Double here
--> It boosts Hit by 40 points.
--> Draw Double from Grendels.

Luck-J
--> Drop Aura here.
--> It boosts Luck by 40 points.
--> Refine Aura from Fury Fragments.

El.Att.J
--> Depends on type of enemy you're figthing.

El.Def.Jx4
--> Put Flare in Slot 1.
--> Put Life in Slot 2.
--> Put Shell in Slot 3
--> Put Full-Life in Slot 4.
--> This will get you 70% absorbtion of Fire, Ice and Thunder elements and 90%
protection against other elements.

St.Att.J
--> Have one member put Sleep, second Silence and third Blind.

St.Def.Jx4
--> Put Pain in Slot 1.
--> Put Confuse in Slot 2.
--> Put Berserk in Slot 3.
--> Put Death (if not going to fight Malboro) or Sleep (if going to fight a
Malboro) in Slot 4.

This is it for Part B. Part C (the one that will finally be complete) is coming
up after next storyline boss/es are defeated.

Blah Bash Blah... Save Rinoa (once again, yawn) and then head for Cactuar
Island... it's time to investigate what the heck that green plant thing is...

----------------------------
#F02 - JUMBO CACTUAR'S MOVES
----------------------------

1. (Leg stomp) --> ST no-name PA --> always deals critical damage
CM --> Higher Vit, Protect status, Defend status
2. Ker Plunk --> AT PA
CM --> Higher Vit, Protect status, Defend status
3. 10000 Needles --> ST Instant-Death class PA --> counterattack class move -->
after Jumbo Cactuar takes damage for fifth time (then tenth, fifteenth and so
on), Jumbo C. will counterattack by using this move on the member who dealt
fifth strike
CM --> None, except Invincible status
4. 'Jumbo Cactuar is hesitating...' --> No-class 'move' --> Jumbo Cactuar is
close to being defeated with 5% or less HP remaining
CM --> None
5. (Run away) --> No-class 'move' --> Jumbo Cactuar will run away when he has
less than 2% of his HP remaining
CM --> When 'Jumbo C. is hesitating' pops on the screen, you have to take him
down with multiple hit Limit Break or execute something that deals significant
amount of damage - Kamikaze, Shockwave Pulsar.

--------------------
#F03 - BOSS STRATEGY
--------------------

Well, aren't we huge? I'm here to take you down.:) First off, Draw and cast
Meltdown on Jumbo. Repeat if needed until he turns into some other color (which
means he's under Vit 0 status). Now, whoever has Revive command, should never
ever attack Jumbo in any way (read 'why not' below)! In my case Zell was such
person - also make sure you beef up that member's Vitality!
Have the member with Aura magic (or Aura Stones, doesn't matter) cast Aura on
Squall, who will be our main attacker for this boss. Keep using Renzokukens.
Now pay attention... after Jumbo takes damage from five attacks (be it magical
or physical), he'll counterattack by 10000 Needles against the member who
executed fifth attack - in this case it'll most surely be Squall who's gonna
croak. So have the member with infinity Revive command revive Squall. Then cast
Aura on Squall again and repeat the process.
Of course Jumbo will not just stand there and let you pummel on him endlessly.
He knows Ker Plunk - multiple-target physical attack - and (Leg stomp) - single
target physical attack. But both can be rendered pretty much useless by having
high Vit-J.
After Jumbo's HP is only at 5% or so remaining, he will 'start hesitating'.
You'll know so by a message box that'll pop up. Now either kill Jumbo with
another Renzokuken, or Duel, or Armor Shot. Heck, even Kamikaze will take him
down - just make sure it's a single attack that takes down Jumbo. If you'll
attack him regularly, he may (Run away) and you'll have to fight him from the
beginning.
You'll receive 14th GF and 1x Gaea's Ring after you defeat him.

Victory Fanfare! Congratulations!

++++++++++++++++++++++++
SPECIAL ADVERTISEMENT!!!
++++++++++++++++++++++++

What to do before encountering next boss???

Got 14th GF yet, but haven't tackled any leftover sidequests? Refer to 'Special
advertisement' section before Boss Fight #F and get your basic info on them.

1. Here's the recommended order in which it is advised to have Cactuar learn
his abilities...
a) Cactuar - Eva-J, Luck-J, Initiative, Defend, Kamikaze, Eva+30%, Luck+50%,
screw Move HP-Up, Expend2x-1 and Auto-Potion, since they're useless.

2. TOP TIP!!!

Excellent! Cactuar holds all five Bonus abilities.
So junction following Bonus abilities: HP (Cactuar, Bros), Str (Cactuar,
Ifrit), Vit (Cactuar, Carbuncle) and Spr (Cactuar, Leviathan).

Cactuar on one member + (Ifrit + Bros + Carbucle + Leviathan on other member) +
fighting Lv 100 monsters on ICTHell/Heaven = strong characters
Just make sure you don't get accidentally killed.:)

Leveling up to Lv 100 with Bonus abilities junctioned is recommended a lot. The
end result will be a single character with HP stat of at least 6000 HP (without
anything junctioned to HP-J) and Str, Vit and Spr moving somewhere around 120

--------------------
#G03 - BOSS STRATEGY
--------------------

To get this guy to appear, you have to move closer to the core *when the light
is not shining*!
--> Pick 'It's not our will to fight' option first.
--> Defeat Ruby Dragon.
--> Pick 'Never' option.
--> Defeat Ruby Dragon.
--> Then pick *hidden third option*!
--> Let's go!

Bahamut: 'I am...Bahamut.'
Squall: 'The Great GF...Bahamut.'
Bahamut: '...GF? I...?'
'Using my powers...'
'...it is you humans...I fear...'

To get rid of his (Claw swipe), put Darkness on Bahamut. Thundaga and Tornado
can be absorbed by having Thunder class magic and Wind class magic junctioned
to El.Def.J. Stop can be rendered useless by having Stop on St.Def.J.
But Mega Flare packs a punch against your members. Therefore it is advised you
cast Shell upon your members to halve the damage done by Mega Flare (IMO Shell
lasts roughly 16 rounds, which is more than enough time to waste Bahamut).
So basically... Put Darkness on Bahamut, Shell on all members, cast Meltdown on
Bahamut, Aura on Squall, proceed with Renzokukens, heal immediately after Mega
Flare is used. Word of warning: Do not forget to heal after you've been struck
with Mega Flare - Bahamut is capable if using it two times in a row!
For an optional boss Bahamut doesn't have that much HP - three decent Renzos
(of course, put Vit 0 on Bahamut first!) and we got ourselves 15th GF.:)
It doesn't matter to Mug Bahamut in this battle... you get same item.

Defeat Bahamut...
Bahamut: 'Have you seen the light...?'

Victory Fanfare! Congratulations!

++++++++++++++++++++++++
SPECIAL ADVERTISEMENT!!!
++++++++++++++++++++++++

What to do before encountering next boss???

Got 15th GF yet, but haven't tackled any leftover sidequests? Refer to 'Special
advertisement' section before Boss Fight #F and get your basic info on them -
this is one of the last chances for you to do so...

1. Here's the recommended order in which it is advised to have Bahamut learn
his abilities...
a) Bahamut - Mug, Rare Item, Auto Protect.
--> Screw Move HP-Up and Expendx2-1, as they're useless.

2. TOP TIP!!!

I know you're itching to tackle next optional boss, but I really strongly
advise against it. Here's why...
--> Curse Spikes from Tri-Faces will provide Luck-J for every member.
--> Curse Spikes from Tri-Faces will provide Abilityx4 for every member.
--> Curse Spikes from Tri-Faces will provide Ultimas for every member.
--> Ruby Dragons will provide raising member's MAX HP.
--> Barriers from Behemoths will provide Eva-J for every member.
--> Behemoths will provide raising member's Mag statistic (for you magic
users).
Once Ultima Weapon is R.I.P., all these enemies are gone and you have to find
them randomly (especially Behemoth is really rare). Still wanna waste such a
great power source?:)
Eden? No problem, you can get her in final dungeon.
But anyway, FAQ is FAQ and I have to take care of the guy...

3. 100x MEGALIXIR!

Card Mod Bahamut card into 100x Megalixir. Your healing needs are now
officially over.

4. ROSETTA STONE TIP!!!

Before getting down there, I'd advise you to at least collect 100x Curse Spike.
Siren must be at Lv 100. Then use Tool-RF to refine 100x Curse Spike into 1x
Dark Matter. Now with same ability refine 1x Dark Matter into 1x Shaman Stone.
Now wait until you get Eden!!!

--------------------
#H03 - BOSS STRATEGY
--------------------

To get this guy to appear, you have to reach the bottom of Deep Sea Deposit
with at least 10 RSP remaining to operate final machine...

Ultima Weapon's main offensive lies in his speed - therefore, for you to keep
up with him (or even outrun him), it is advised that you have Spd-J on all
three members with that are going to fight Ultima Weapon. Pandemona has Spd-J,
Cerberus has Spd-J. You also should have 1x Spd-J which you Mugged from
Cerberus. Don't have any of those? Then you either have two options...
--> Either you return here later on disc 4 when you'll have three members with
Spd-J and kick Ultima Weapon's ass.
--> You kick his ass now, but it's going to be a bit harder, since Ultima
Weapon likes to cheat a bit.:)
First off, make absolutely sure that all of your members have Item Command
ability junctioned. They must be able to revive KO-ed members at any given
time. Also junction Quake to El.Def.J to absorb Earth damage.

So the battle has started. Note that Ultima Weapon is extremely fast and if you
have poor Spd-J (or none at all), you may get your early The End. Ultima Weapon
is known to be able to use his Light Pillar twice in a succession (maybe more,
but that has yet to happen to me) and if you're left without means to revive
your members, then it's The End of the line for you. Don't rely on Phoenix to
come and rescue you often. Rebirth Flame may kick in once or twice, but third
time is highly unlikely.
Once you initiate the battle with Ultima Weapon, cast Shell on all members.
Then cast Meltdown on Ultima Weapon. (Sword swipe) can be rendered useless by
having high Vit-J (refer above for what to junction). Quake should not touch
you at all since you prolly have Quake on El.Def.J (right?:)).
High Spr will take care of Meteor a bit - in tandem with Shell damage will be
greatly reduced. Gravija's damage will be halved by Shell on your members - and
hopefully bring them into yellow status when you can unleash Limit Breaks -
have Squall Renzokukening, Zell Punch Rushing and Booyaing, Irvine Armor
Shoting - the usual way of wasting any boss.
As soon as Light Pillar is used on any of your members, revive that member
immediately. Don't bother casting Curaga on your members, heal with help of
Megalixirs instead when needed.
If you want to play extra bit safe (that is, Ultima Weapon can use Meteor right
after Gravija was casted and Meteor can potentially KO a member or two), defeat
Ultima Weapon with casting Aura on Squall when he's not in critical and have
only him Renzokukening, whilst other two members are on a standby and act as
supporters / medics - they will heal / revive Squall or themselves when needed
and provide Aura status for Squall.

In all that speed, there are three things to consider...
--> DRAW EDEN! You can't afford to miss this GF.
--> Draw Ultima magic if you feel daring (or if you're under Invincible status)
--> Do not Mug Ultima Weapon, cos you only get crappy 1x Three Stars (I'm not
that much of a magic user, as you prolly guessed already). Instead it's better
for you to receive 100x Ultima Stone Ultima Weapon drops when defeated. You'll
also receive Eden card.

So in a nutshell...
Quake on El.Def.J, Shell on all members, Meltdown on Ultima Weapon, Aura on
Squall, Renzokuken, Renzokuken, Renzokuken, immediate revival of KO-ed members
takes priority, heal with items (Megalixirs from Bahamut card!!!) after Gravija
is used. Phew... anything else?:)

Ultima Weapon is suddenly not 'the strongest, ultimate monster'... But you
haven't faced greatest foe yet...

Victory Fanfare! Congratulations!

++++++++++++++++++++++++
SPECIAL ADVERTISEMENT!!!
++++++++++++++++++++++++

What to do before encountering next boss???

Got 16th GF yet, but haven't tackled any leftover sidequests? Refer to 'Special
advertisement' section before Boss Fight #F and get your basic info on them -
this is one of the last chances for you to do so...

1. Here's the recommended order in which it is advised to have Eden learn her
abilities...
a) Eden - GFAbl Med-RF, Darkside, Luck+50%, Eva+30%.
--> Screw Mad Rush and Expendx3-1, cos they're useless.

2. Well, so you really did waste Ultima Weapon? Now all those wonderful fixed
encounters are gone... I feel for you... many good things could be found in
those fixed encounters...

3. ROSETTA STONE TIP!!! (continued)

Now that you have GFAbl Med-RF, refine 1x Shaman Stone from before into 1x
Rosetta Stone. Use this item on Quezo (or any other GF you wish - just make
sure that the third member learns Abilityx4) to have all battling members be
able to junction up to four character abilities.

USE THIS TIP AS A FUTURE REFERENCE ON WHERE TO FIND AN EASY SOURCE OF ROSETTA
STONES!

4. From now, I'll take it that you didn't waste Ultima Weapon and you want to
get Eden in final dungeon... But in case you got her anyway, junction her to
Squall. For now I'll mark Eden like this --> *Eden* --> that means that I did
not get her, but you did and I include her info anyway.

5. DEFEAT CCGROUP ON BOARD BALAMB GARDEN IF YOU WANT AN EASY GAME!!!

6. CARD MOOOOOOOOOD MANIA!!!

This game couldn't be completed without you (just kidding on that one:)). Your
card count should now hold all Lv8, Lv9 and Lv10 cards plus Pupu card. Or in
other case... If you followed my recommendation, then you're only missing
*Odin* and *Eden* card. Have no fret, we can get them back on disc 4.
It's modding time! Now I'll include all info on which rare cards to mod and
what they mod into...

PuPu --> 1x Hungry Cookpot
Chicobo --> 100x Gysahl Greens
Angelo --> 100x Elixir
Gilgamesh --> 10x Holy War
MiniMog --> 100x Pet House
Chubby Chocobo --> 100x LuvLuv G
Quezacotl --> 100x Dynamo Stone
Shiva --> 100x North Wind
Ifrit --> 3x Elem Atk

Diablos --> 100x Black Hole
Leviathan --> 3x Doc's Code
*Odin* --> 100x Dead Spirit
Pandemona --> 100x Windmill
Cerberus --> 100x Lightweight
Alexander --> 3x Moon Curtain
Phoenix --> 3x Phoenix Spirit
Bahamut --> 100x Megalixir

*Eden* --> 3x Monk's Code

Kiros --> 3x Accelerator
Laguna --> 100x Hero
Selphie --> 3x Elem Guard
Quistis --> 3x Samantha Soul
Irvine --> 3x Rocket Engine
Zell --> 3x Hyper Wrist
Rinoa --> 3x Magic Armlet
Edea --> 3x Royal Crown

--> The cards remaining in your hand are Sacred, Minotaur, Seifer and Squall
and a random Lv6 or Lv7 boss card. Of course, feel free to include any other
rare card in your hand if you don't feel like modding it.

Let's get out of this mess finally and teach Lunatic Pandora a thing or six...

---------------------
#2103 - BOSS STRATEGY
---------------------

Raijin: 'See, just like I said, ya know?'
Fujin: '......'

[Squall: 'Hey! That's my line!']

Bobo the clown strikes again... with a help from Bozo the clown... Fujin's
arsenal of attacks has vastly improved since last encounter - Pain (Pain on
St.Def.J), Confuse (Confuse on St.Def.J), Meteor (high Sor), Metsu (high Vit),
Regen, Haste... whoa! My kind of tough woman.;)
On the other hand, Raijin's attacks haven't vastly improved - he loses Hi-
Potion, but now knows Aura. He also gains a new physical attack - an animation
shows Raijin powering up his fist and then jumping a target member punching him
and at same time releasing the energy gathered in his fist in a big explosion.
As usual, cast Meltdown on Fujin and Raijin first.

When Fujin wastes a few turns...
Fujin: 'DECISION.'
'DESTROY. HELP, SEIFER.'
She will now use Meteor. This is the only time in entire fight when she uses
it.

When Raijin 'wastes' a few turns...
Raijin: 'Time to get serious, ya know!?'
He will now cast Aura on himself...
Raijin: 'Prepare yourself for defeat!'
And immediately afterward he'll execute Raijin Special. From now on he is able
to Raijin Special you any time he wishes - he doesn't have to be under Aura
status. Be vary, tho' - for the duration of Aura Raijin Special is twice as
powerful.

So take care that your HP is high (high Spr, high Vit) when Fujin uses Meteor.
To prevent Raijin from Raijin Special-izing into you five much, throw Reflect
at him before he Aura-s himself.:)

Raijin and Fujin are extremely vulnerable to Sleep, so use this to your
advantage. It's a good thing to assign one member as a medic for this fight -
have this member on a standby. If Fujin uses Sai, you will immediately have a
member available to do the necessary healing. Zan and Metsu (beefed up version
of Zan) aren't that dangerous - or at least nothing that high Vit couldn't take
care of.

Beat Raijin at about 50% of his HP remaining...
Raijin: 'Not bad, Squall!'
'I can see why you're Seifer's rival!'

Beat Raijin at about 25% of his HP remaining...
Raijin: 'Whoa... Wow!'
'No wonder Seifer fears ya!'

Mug Fujin for 2x Megalixir - otherwise she drops 1x Megalixir.
If you Mug Raijin, you'll get 1x Power Wrist - otherwise he drops few Str Up
items, which is IMO a better bounty to look for.

Send final greetings to Raijin...
Raijin: 'I... I lost again, ya know...'

Send final greetings to Fujin...
Fujin: 'CALLOUS...'

[Squall: 'That'll teach you stealing my lines.']

#2202a - MOBILE TYPE 8'S MOVES
------------------------------

1. (Laser whip) --> ST no-name PA --> used in *MOBILE ON, SUPPORT OFF*
CM --> Higher Vit, Protect status, Defend status
2. Corona --> AT Special class PA --> first move used when boss changes into
*MOBILE OFF, SUPPORT ON* --> ignores Vit --> brings every member's HP down to 1
CM --> None, except Invincible status
3. Megido Flame --> AT Special class & No-element MA --> last move used before
boss returns to *MOBILE ON, SUPPORT OFF* --> ignores Spr
CM --> Shell status, Defend status

Special 'moves':
1. 'Mobile Weaponry attack mode ON' & 'Support Weaponry attack mode OFF' -->
Mobile Type 8 will be the one doing the attacks for a few turns. Attacking
Mobile Type 8 will result in Mobile Type 8 countering with Twin Homing Laser.
2. 'Mobile Weaponry attack mode OFF' & 'Support Weaponry attack mode ON' -->
Mobile Type 8 will now discontinue the attacks for a while. But don't get
cocky.
First attack used will be Corona which drops everybody's HP to 1 - heal
immediately or Probes will strike you down. Last attack used before modes
change again will be Megido Flame. Attacking any Probe in this mode will result
in that Probe countering by Homing Laser.

---------------------------
#2202b - LEFT PROBE'S MOVES
---------------------------

1. (Spin dash) --> ST no-name PA --> used in *MOBILE OFF, SUPPORT ON*
CM --> Higher Vit, Protect status, Defend status
2. Homing Laser --> ST No-element MA --> counterattack class move --> used
whenever you attack Left Probe when boss is in *MOBILE OFF, SUPPORT ON*
CM --> Higher Spr, Shell status, Defend status
3. Twin Homing Laser --> AT No-element MA --> joined counterattack class move
--> used in conjunction with Right Probe whenever Mobile Type 8 is attacked
when in *MOBILE ON, SUPPORT OFF*
CM --> Higher Spr, Shell status, Defend status

----------------------------
#2202c - RIGHT PROBE'S MOVES
----------------------------

1. (Spin dash) --> ST no-name PA --> used in *MOBILE OFF, SUPPORT ON*
CM --> Higher Vit, Protect status, Defend status
2. Homing Laser --> ST No-element MA --> counterattack class move --> used
whenever you attack Right Probe when boss is in *MOBILE OFF, SUPPORT ON*
CM --> Higher Spr, Shell status, Defend status
3. Twin Homing Laser --> AT No-element MA --> joined counterattack class move
--> used in conjunction with Left Probe whenever Mobile Type 8 is attacked when
in *MOBILE ON, SUPPORT OFF*
CM --> Higher Spr, Shell status, Defend status

---------------------
#2203 - BOSS STRATEGY
---------------------

'Mobile Weaponry attack mode ON'
'Support Weaponry attack mode OFF'

Pay attention to these messages. Whenever you'll attack Mobile Type 8 during
this mode, you'll get countered by Twin Homing Laser. So use these few turns to
Mug 2x Str Up from Right Probe and 2x Vit Up from Left Probe. All attacks used
in this mode will be boss' weak (Laser whip).

After a few turns...

'Mobile Weaponry attack mode OFF'
'Support Weaponry attack mode ON'

Now be careful. Have all members at standby. First thing launched at you will
be Corona - all members' HP drops to measly 1 HP. Heal at once (Megalixir helps
a lot). After Corona dealt it's damage, it's time that you concentrate on
Mobile Type 8 that just split itself. Don't attack any Probe or it'll counter
with Homing Laser. Cast Meltdown on Mobile Type 8 for starters. Then (of
course:)) cast Aura on Squall and let him unleash a good Renzo or two (boss'
Vit is somewhat low, so make sure you abuse that).

If boss still lives, make yourself weary of Megido Flame (it ignores Spr),
another dangerous move that Mobile Type 8 uses before switching modes. Members
low on HP will most certainly meet their doom. Even though it is advantageous
to be left at critical state, you never know when you're gonna get struck with
some powerful move.

'Mobile Weaponry attack mode ON'
'Support Weaponry attack mode OFF'

Etc. The pattern repeats itself throughout the entire fight. Well, except for
Vit Ups and Str Ups there's no real use for this boss anymore, so you can
safely make scrap metal outta it.

---------------------
#2303 - BOSS STRATEGY
---------------------

Seifer's third attempt at trying to show you who's better and also the saddest.
This is the easiest boss on disc 3. Heh. Just make sure that you have four
following things...
--> You didn't get Odin!
--> You have Draw command junctioned
--> You have high Vit
--> You have Fire class magic on El.Def.J

First stock up on Aura. This is the only fight in whole game that you can Draw
Aura from an enemy, so don't miss it. Once you have 100x Aura for each member,
Draw and cast Aura on your members and then pummel Seifer into oblivion. Firaga
and Bloodfest are nothing to be afraid of.:)

When Seifer is finally defeated...
Seifer: 'Is this...the end...?'

Special note: In case you got Odin, following will happen...

As soon as battle starts, Odin will attempt to Zantetsuken Seifer...

Squall: 'Odin...!?'
Seifer: 'Hah, I won't go down that easy.'
'Show me what you got, Squall!'
'Let me add another scar for ya!'

Then halfway thru the fight...

Gilgamesh: 'You gave me the 4th one...'
'Huh? Was it you...?'
'Then dodge my sword!'
'Eat this!!!'
Seifer: 'Ergwahhhh!!!'
Gilgamesh: 'Where is the dimensional interval...?'

Victory Fanfare! Congratulations!

#2402b - RINOA'S MOVES
----------------------

No moves!

---------------------
#2403 - BOSS STRATEGY
---------------------

Zell: 'Gotta save Rinoa!'
Quistis: 'We're saving Rinoa!'
Selphie: 'We have to save Rinoa!'
Squall: 'Just go for Adel!'

Many people seem to come to an unconquerable obstacle when facing Adel, but in
all truth it's all about strategy and right junctions. For junctions please
refer to the above humongous chunk of info on junctions of this part of FAQ,
and for strategy - it's all in here.
To start, we'll first take care of ourselves. Do you have Auto-Shell character
ability junctioned? No? In that case, cast Shell on all members at start of
battle. Shell lasts for 16 turns (my rough estimate) and will last for more
than enough time for us to kill Adel. On the other hand, Auto-Shell lasts
forever.:)
Next thing to do would be to cast Regen on your members. Healing for the fight
has been taken care of. Now we'll take care of Rinoa. Draw and cast Regen on
her, then Shell her as well - doing so will halve (Drain) damage that Adel
keeps using on Rinoa and for every (Drain) Adel will pull off successfully,
Regen will kick in. Every time when Adel (Drain)-s Rinoa, Adel will immediately
execute one of following attacks:
Meteor will *always* be first attack used - halve the damage by Shell
Quake - Quake on El.Def.J will heal you:)
Flare - halve the damage by Shell (do not be under Reflect or else Flare might
bounce back at Rinoa)
Energy Bomber - halve the damage by Protect, nullify the damage by Defend...
but in all seriousness you shouldn't worry about this attack as it's rarely
used

If somehow you still get crippled to low HP after some of these attacks, use
items to heal. Do not take chances that you might just pull it off. Better play
safe than sorry.

After few turns pass, 'Magical powers are concentrated on Adel!'. You'll also
see visual change in Adel's stance. If you're low on HP, use recovery items
(Bahamut card!) to restore lost HP. Don't heal with magic, cos it won't be as
much effective since you're Shelled. After some time passes again, Adel will
unleash Ultima, her strongest attack - but you've made it thru (Shell status
will halve the damage for you:))!

Then Adel will return to usual pattern - (Drain) on Rinoa, then throwing one of
the above four attacks, then 'Magical powers...', Ultima, etc.

If Rinoa's Regen wears off (it doesn't last into infinity), cast Regen again.
You can't afford to lose cos of such careless mistake.

Now to really show Adel how stuff should be done...
Cast Meltdown on Adel, then Aura on Zell / Irvine (whoever you have in your
party). When Zell starts Dueling, only use Punch Rush and Booya. Do not use
multiple target hits (My Final Heaven and such). Same goes for Irvine. Flame
Shot, Scatter Shot and Hyper Shot are no-no. Armor Shot is a perfect choice -
with Irvine's high Str-J Adel will face her doom in no time. Squall is not a
character whose limits are recommended to use for this fight - Fated Circle and
Blasting Zone are not your friends...

If you feel daring a bit, Mug Rinoa for 8x Megalixir.
Adel carries 1x Samantha Soul.
No items are dropped after the battle, so you might as well Mug these.

Adel is defeated!

Victory Fanfare! Congratulations!

What to do before encountering next boss???

There's not much you can do except reorganizing your junctions a bit.

Ultimate junctions are coming up in a while. We have to swim thru two more boss
fights, then obtain Eden who is the GF to look for...

---------------------
#2503 - BOSS STRATEGY
---------------------

This be easy fight until you get to 11th Sorceress.:)
First Sorceress knows (Telekinetic punch), Fire and Esuna - no problem.
Second Sorceress knows (Telekinetic punch), Thunder and Esuna - no problem.
Third Sorceress knows (Telekinetic punch), Fira and Esuna - no problem.
Fourth Sorceress knows (Telekinetic punch), Blizzara and Esuna - no problem.
Fifth Sorceress knows (Telekinetic punch), Thundara and Esuna - no problem.
Sixth Sorceress knows (Telekinetic punch), Aero and Esuna - no problem.
Seventh Sorceress knows (Telekinetic punch), Double and Thundaga - no problem.
Eight Sorceress knows (Telekinetic punch), Quake and Meltdown - kill her fast!
Ninth Sorceress knows (Telekinetic punch) and Meteor - kill her fast.
Tenth Sorceress knows (Telekinetic punch), Double and Flare - kill her fast.

And now a true boss emerges from beyond time... err, what the heck IS this,
anyway? *shivers* Don't attack this Sorceress yet! Instead wait for her to
start counting down to Ultima. Before she actually does that, use the
opportunity you're given to heal HP you might have lost from fights with
previous Sorceresses. If you attack this Sorceress before she starts counting
down, she'll counterattack by (Creepy touch). Once the countdown begins, she's
all yours. Meltdown on Sorceress, Aura on Squall and Renzokuken all the way.
If counter reaches 2 and Sorceress is still not defeated, heal (if not done so
already) and take the Ultima punishment - I'll make sure it'll be me next time
waving goodbye, hehehe. Now again wait a bit for countdown to start. Then
finally kill her and good riddance to this boring fight.:)

No Victory Fanfare will sound after the fight! Congratulations!

---------------------
#2603 - BOSS STRATEGY
---------------------

This boss can be found by taking the stairs up. It's impossible to miss him.
Let's get it on!

First part of the boss is not hard at all. All he knows is Firaga, Thundaga and
Blizzaga. With right junctions on El.Def.J he can't touch you right now. Mug
Sphinxaur for 1x Elixir. Once you waste Sphinxaur's 10000 HP, his head will
'explode'. Meet Sphinxara (argh, stupid names).
Sphinxara has 10000 HP as well, so kill it in a quick way. Doom shouldn't
bother you too much, since you have some time before it kicks in and kills you
(TIP: Have all members under Zombie and Sphinxara will only be using Doom,
which will miss on your members).
If you want a bit of AP, wait until Sphinxara does Magic Summon. First monster
to appear will be Jelleye - piece of cake. Second monster to appear will be
Forbidden. May be dangerous if you don't kill it fast after it starts using Iai
Blow (have Holy on El.Att.J). Third monster will be Tri-Face. Mug a few Curse
Spikes if you wish and then waste it.
If Sphinxara succeeds in Dooming one member, he will start to use Slow, Zombie
(let him cast it on Doomed member and... where did the timer go? Did it split
somewhere?;)) and Sleep. No biggie with right junctions, eh?
Well, enough of this chitchat, send him see his maker...

Victory Fanfare! Congratulations!

THERE'S LOTS TO BE DONE.

Introducing final section in...

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CCC - PERFECT JUNCTIONING SECTION, PART C
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. TOP TIP!!!

Did you miss Drawing any GF? Right now it's your second chance to get those GFs
back. Following GFs can be found in final dungeon...
--> Pandemona, Leviathan, Alexander, Siren, Cerberus, Carbuncle and Eden

2. Now that you have defeated Sphinxaur, unlock Draw ability!
--> Go thru the doors behind Sphinxaur.
--> Walk on the chandelier and fall in room below.
--> Go thru the doors in the back.
--> Go up the stairs.
--> WALK over the bridge and pick up Armory key on the bridge, then enter the
door on the left of the screen.
--> Start climbing up the clock tower.
--> On one screen you will see a bell hanging and swinging from one side to
another.
--> Stand as close as you can to the bell and when it comes close, press
action. Squall will jump on the bell and thus be able to reach the other side.
--> Here Tiamat awaits your party.
--> Before commencing battle, make sure you have Draw junctioned!!!
--> Start battle, Draw Eden from Tiamat and get the hell outta there. It IS
possible to escape from this battle!
--> Name Eden and get out of Ultimecia's Castle.
--> Go on the chain and jump thru the middle portal.
--> You'll end up on Centra continent.
--> Find nearby Chocobo Forest and do whatever you have to get a Chocobo.
--> Ride the Chocobo past Centra Ruins, then go into the sea and 'board' Centra
continent again near the place where you destroyed G-Garden on end of disc 2.
Then ride toward Kashkabald Desert to find Ragnarok.
--> Aboard the Ragnarok CCGroup members will greet you. Whohooo!

3. CCGroup members will hold ALL of rare cards except PuPu. They have all cards
- it doesn't matter if you modded it, lost it or forgot to get it - the card
you're looking for will be in their hands.
--> Only Diamond girls hold cards that are exclusive to Card Queen - left
Diamond girl plays them more often

4. Here's the recommended order in which it is advised to have Eden learn her
abilities...
a) Eden - GFAbl Med-RF, Darkside, Luck+50%, Eva+30%.
--> Screw Mad Rush and Expendx3-1, cos they're useless.

**************************
PERFECT JUNCTIONS - START!
**************************

Okay, gals and guys, this is it. I must now take trouble into describing what
is the best setup for your junctioning needs...

1. First thing we shall discuss is Statistic junctions - you know, HP, Str and
like...

A) HP - Item that teaches this is HP-J Scroll.
--> No problem! It can be found in Esthar's Pet Shop!

B) Str - Item that teaches this is Str-J Scroll.
--> No problem! It can be found in Esthar's Pet Shop!

C) Vit - Item that teaches this is Vit-J Scroll.
--> No problem! It can be found in Esthar's Pet Shop!

D) Mag - Item that teaches this is Mag-J Scroll.
--> No problem! It can be found in Esthar's Pet Shop!

E) Spr - Item that teaches this is Spr-J Scroll.
--> No problem! It can be found in Esthar's Pet Shop!

F) Spd - Item that teaches this is Spd-J Scroll.
--> Refine 2x Spd Up in 1x Spd-J with of GFAbl Med-RF
--> Refine 5x Rocket Engine in 1x Spd Up with Forbid Med-RF
--> Refine 1x Hundred Needles in 1x Spd Up with Forbid Med-RF
--> Refine 1x Irvine card in 3x Rocket Engine with Card Mod
--> Refine 100x Cactus Thorn in 1x Hundred Needles with GFAbl Med-RF
--> Get Cactus Thorns by defeating Cactuars
--> By all means do it thru the way of cards.
--> Ten Irvine cards later you should have missing 3x Spd-J Scroll.
--> Or if you want to be completely independent on multiple GFs, I suggest you
strive for 6x Spd-J Scroll.

G) Eva - Item that teaches this is Aegis Amulet.
--> Refine 50x Barrier in 1x Aegis Amulet with GFAbl Med-RF
--> The only consistent supply of Barriers are Behemoths. But dammit - they're
really rare. But wait!!!
--> Fixed encounter in Deep Sea Deposit is at your disposal in case you haven't
defeated Ultima Weapon yet.
--> 1x Behemoth has 2x Barrier for Mugging. Behemoths are extremely vulnerable
to Silence and Death - use this to your advantage.
--> Although it may seem boring, persevere and (not-so)-soon you will have 4x
Aegis Amulet you need for four other members.
--> I suggest you strive for 6x Aegis Amulet for complete independence.

H) Hit - There is no item that teaches this.
--> GFs with Eva-J are Diablos, Cerberus and Eden
--> Hit-J is not so important anyway (except when fighting Cactuars)
--> Squall and Selphie can have 255% Hit rate without junctions

I) Luck - Item that teaches this is Luck-J Scroll.
--> Refine 1x Dark Matter in 1x Luck-J Scroll with GFAbl Med-RF
--> Refine 2x Luck Up in 1x Luck-J Scroll with GFAbl Med-RF
--> Refine 100x Curse Spike into 1x Dark Matter with Tool-RF (Siren Lv100)
--> Luck-J are hard to come by, so just forget them.:) Concentrate on where can
you get a good supply of Curse Spikes.
--> Again fixed encounter in Deep Sea Deposit comes to your rescue.
--> 1x Tri-Face has 6x Curse Spike (or rarely 8x Curse Spike) for Mugging. Tri-
Faces are extremely vulnerable to Sleep. Use this knowledge to your advantage.
--> Although it may seem boring, persevere and (not-so)-soon you will have 5x
Dark Matter you need for five other members.
--> I suggest you strive for 6x Dark Matter for complete independence.

2. Now let's take care of Elemental stuff...

A) Elemental Attack - Item that teaches this is Elem Atk.
--> Refine 1x Ifrit card in 3x Elem Atk with Card Mod
--> Then simply get Ifrit card back from some CCGroup member and Card Mod it
again
--> You now have 6x Elem Atk

B) Elemental Defensex4 - Item that teaches this is Elem Guard.
--> Refine 1x Selphie card in 3x Elem Guard with Card Mod
--> Then simply get Selphie card back from some CCGroup member and Card Mod it
again
--> You now have 6x Elem Guard

3. And finally let's take care od Status stuff

A) Status Attack - Item that teaches this is Status Atk
--> Refine 1x Siren card in 3x Status Atk with Card Mod
--> Then simply get Siren card back from some CCGroup member and Card Mod it
again
--> You now have 6x Status Atk

B) Status Defensex4 - Item that teaches this is Status Guard
--> Refine 1x Doomtrain card in 3x Status Guard with Card Mod
--> Then simply get Doomtrain card back from some CCGroup member and Card Mod
it again
--> You now have 6x Status Guard

**********
WHAT NEXT?
**********

1. Buy a bunch-o of Amnesia Greens (Tonberry's Call Shop).
2. Make Quezo, Shiva and Ifrit forget *all* abilities except their unique ones.
3. Now do the following...
a) Use 1x HP-J Scroll on Quezo, 1x HP-J Scroll on Shiva, 1x HP-J Scroll on
Ifrit
b) Use 1x Str-J Scroll on Quezo, 1x Str-J Scroll on Shiva, 1x Str-J Scroll on
Ifrit
c) Use 1x Vit-J Scroll on Quezo, 1x Vit-J Scroll on Shiva, 1x Vit-J Scroll on
Ifrit
d) Use 1x Mag-J Scroll on Quezo, 1x Mag-J Scroll on Shiva, 1x HP-J Scroll on
Ifrit
e) Use 1x Spr-J Scroll on Quezo, 1x Spr-J Scroll on Shiva, 1x HP-J Scroll on
Ifrit
f) Use 1x Spd-J Scroll on Quezo, 1x Spd-J Scroll on Shiva, 1x HP-J Scroll on
Ifrit
g) Use 1x Aegis Amulet on Quezo, 1x Aegis Amulet on Shiva, 1x Aegis Amulet on
Ifrit
h) Use 1x Luck-J Scroll on Quezo, 1x Luck-J Scroll on Shiva, 1x Luck-J Scroll
on Ifrit
j) Use 1x Elem Atk on Quezo, 1x Elem Atk on Shiva, 1x Elem Atk on Ifrit
k) Use 1x Elem Guard on Quezo, 1x Elem Guard on Shiva, 1x Elem Guard on Ifrit
l) Use 1x Status Atk on Quezo, 1x Status Atk on Shiva, 1x Status Atk on Ifrit
m) Use 1x Status Guard on Quezo, 1x Status Guard on Shiva, 1x Status Guard on
Ifrit

--> With remaining 3x 'Something' I suggest you wait a bit longer.

RESULT: Quezo, Shiva and Ifrit will now single handedly provide all junctioning
slots for a single character you will junction them to.

--> Junction Quezo to Squall
--> Junction Shiva to Quistis
--> Junction Ifrit to Zell or Irvine - they're both good members to have

***************************
PERFECT JUNCTIONS - MIDDLE!
***************************

Junctioning magic has been taken care of, now it would be time to take a look
what Commands are best to have.

A) Squall

Slot 1 - Attack
Slot 2 - Item
Slot 3 - Recover
Slot 4 - Revive

B) Quistis

Slot 1 - Attack
Slot 2 - Magic
Slot 3 - Treatment
Slot 4 - Revive

C) Zell / Irvine

Slot 1 - Attack
Slot 2 - Item
Slot 3 - Recover
Slot 4 - Treatment

I find this to be the best setup. You have two characters at any time that can
do the reviving (Revive command), two characters at any time that can do the
healing (Recover command), two characters at any time that can remove negative
statuses (Treatment command), two characters that will make battles easier with
help of items (Item command) and one member that will assist the two attackers
by making life for enemies harder (Magic command).

How to get more Recover commands?
--> Item that teaches Recover is Healing Ring.
--> Refine 100x Whisper in 1x Healing Ring with GFAbl Med-RF.
--> The only consistent source of Whispers are Adamantoises.
--> It's possible to Mug 3x Whisper from 1x Adamantoise.
--> Get 100x Whisper. Or better yet, strive to get at least three more Healing
Rings.
--> We want to have a single GF junctioned that will have everything you need
for one single member.

How to get more Revive commands?
--> Item that teaches Revive is Phoenix Spirit.
--> Refine 1x Phoenix card in 3x Phoenix Spirit with Card Mod.

How to get more Treatment commands?
--> Item that teaches Treatment is Med Kit.
--> Refine 100x Dragon Fang in 1x Med Kit with GFAbl Med-RF.
--> The pretty consistent source of Dragon Fangs are Blue Dragons.
--> Get 100x Dragon Fang for 1x Med Kit. Or better yet, strive to get at least
three more Med Kits.
--> We want to have a single GF junctioned that will have everything you need
for one single member.

**********
WHAT NEXT?
**********

a) Use 1x Healing Ring on Quezo, 1x Healing Ring on Shiva, 1x Healing Ring on
Ifrit
b) Use 1x Phoenix Spirit on Quezo, 1x Phoenix Spirit on Shiva, 1x Phoenix
Spirit on Ifrit
c) Use 1x Med Kit on Quezo, 1x Med Kit on Shiva, 1x Med Kit on Ifrit

RESULT: Quezo, Shiva and Ifrit will now single handedly provide all command
abilities you'll ever need.

***************************
PERFECT JUNCTIONS - FINISH!
***************************

All that's left are most recommended character / party abilities.

Do you have three Abilityx4 already?

--> By my game Ifrit has already received Rosetta Stone (the one from Cheryl's
Shop in Esthar) - Ifrit is now junctioned to Zell
--> Additional Rosetta Stone can be found in Ultimecia's Castle. Use this
Rosetta Stone on Quezo - Quezo is junctioned to Squall
--> If you don't have anymore Rosetta Stones, go hunting after 100x Curse Spike
again. Refer to recipe below...
100x Curse Spike [Tool-RF (Siren Lv 100!)] 1x Dark Matter [Tool-RF] 1x Shaman
Stone [GFAbl Med-RF] 1x Rosetta Stone
... then use this newly acquired Rosetta Stone on Shiva

RESULT: Quezo, Shiva and Ifrit are now perfect GFs with perfect abilities
setup. By now they should have 17 slots filled + their unique abilities.

RECOMMENDED CHARACTER ABILITIES

Squall / Quistis / Zell
Slot 1 - Auto-Haste (the most important of them all)
Slot 2 - Whatever (maybe Str+60%)
Slot 3 - Whatever (maybe Vit+60%)
Slot 4 - Whatever (maybe Spr+60%)

Really, it's hard for me to decide on what would be the best setup...

A) Auto-Haste
--> Item that teaches this is Accelerator
--> Refine 1x Kiros card in 3x Accelerator with Card Mod
--> Then simply get Kiros card back from some CCGroup member

B) Str+60%
--> Item that teaches this is Hyper Wrist
--> Refine 1x Zell card in 3x Hyper Wrist Atk with Card Mod
--> Then simply get Zell card back from some CCGroup member

C) Vit+60%
--> Item that teaches this is Adamantine
--> Refine 1x Minotaur card in 10x Adamantine with Card Mod
--> Then simply get Minotaur card back from some CCGroup member

D) Spr+60%
--> Item that teaches this is Magic Armlet
--> Refine 1x Rinoa card in 3x Magic Armlet with Card Mod
--> Then simply get Rinoa card back from some CCGroup member

**********
WHAT NEXT?
**********

a) Use 1x Accelerator on Siren, 1x Accelerator on Diablos, 1x Accelerator on
Cerberus (but he already knows Auto-Haste:))
b) Use 1x Hyper Wrist on Siren, 1x Hyper Wrist on Diablos, 1x Hyper Wrist on
Cerberus
c) Use 1x Adamantine on Siren, 1x Adamantine on Diablos, 1x Adamantine on
Cerberus
d) Use 1x Magic Armlet on Siren, 1x Magic Armlet on Diablos, 1x Magic Armlet on
Cerberus

RESULT: Siren, Diablos and Cerberus will act as support GFs.
--> Junction Siren to Squall
--> Junction Diablos to Zell
--> Junction Cerberus to Quistis

Now your characters are finally set... Eeerm, not really... you still need the
info on what magic to junction where... Ooops.:)

-------------------------
#2702 - TRI-POINT'S MOVES
-------------------------

1. (Claw swipe) --> ST no-name PA
CM --> Higher Vit, Protect status, Defend status
2. Scan --> ST 'MA' --> Tri-Point will use Scan on whatever member he plans to
attack next with Onrush
CM --> None
3. Mega Spark --> AT Thunder class & Special class MA --> counterattack class
move --> Tri-Point will counter any attack of yours by using Mega Spark -->
this attack ignores Spr --> for additional info look in the strategy
CM --> Shell status, Defend status, Thunder class magic on El.Def.J
4. Onrush --> ST Special class PA --> ignores Vit --> Tri-Point will use this
on the member he scanned previously
CM --> Protect status, Defend status

---------------------
#2703 - BOSS STRATEGY
---------------------

Tri-Point: 'USING ELEMENTAL ATTACKS.'
'WHATEVER I DON'T LIKE, I DON'T USE.'

Yadda yadda yadda. For one of final bosses he sure has low HP.

Quick victory way:

Just keep attacking him. Even though he'll Mega Spark you for every attack you
use at him, you'll absorb the damage, cos we have Thunder class magic on
El.Def.J. 7 or 8 good physical attacks will kiss Tri-Point goodbye.

Professional victory way (ie, you come to Tri-Point later with more seals
unlocked):

Scan Tri-Point first and check what is he weak against. If it's Fire element,
have a member with Fire class magic on El.Att.J attack Tri-Point. This will
shift Tri-Point's weakness to Ice element. So now have the member with Ice
class magic on El.Att.J attack Tri-Point. This will shift Tri-Point's weakness
to Fire element... see the pattern? Follow the flow and you will never see Mega
Spark.

Mega Spark will be used if any harm is done to Tri-Point and doesn't include
the right element that Tri-Point is currently weak against. Mega Spark ignores
Spr and can deal tremendous amount of damage, but Thunder class magic on
El.Def.J will be your best friend.:)

If any member gets Scanned, cast Protect on that member immediately. Or else
the following Onrush is sure to KO that member - Onrush ignores Vit.

Draw Siren if you don't have her already.

Anything else I've forgotten? Don't think so... so wave this boss goodbye.

Victory Fanfare! Congratulations!

#2803 - BOSS STRATEGY

Red Giant's ramblings...
If you use a physical attack on him...
'GWahaHA! PHysical attacKS? USeleSS!'
If you use a magical attack on him...
'THat magic is useleSS!'
If you use a GF against him...
'THat GF is a waste of tiME!'
If you use Demi on him...
'Urgh! N-NO more DEMI, pleaSE...!!!'

Weeeeell, whaddaya know? It just so happens that Red Giant has Demi for
Drawing. But more luckily we have Magic command unlocked from our last fight.
Meltdown on Red Giant and he will no longer possess that huge Vit and Spr.
Furthermore, he gets so easily Darknessed. How can he land a successful strike
then? Keep pummeling on now helpless Red Giant (he'll even lose his slicer) and
you win!

Draw Pandemona if you don't have him already.

Victory Fanfare! Congratulations!

---------------------
#2903 - BOSS STRATEGY
---------------------

Now that Magic and Limit Break seals are open...

Quick victory way:

Meltdown on Trauma, Aura on Squall, Renzo on Trauma (repeat if needed), victory
is yours.

Professional victory way:

There's not much strategy involved here, except if you want to see all the
attacks... At start of battle Trauma will create two Dromas. You may kill them
if you wish, but I advise against it - Mega Pulse Cannon hurts. Instead pummel
on Trauma with physical attacks. Once his life is beginning to fade, he will
start Draining Dromas, eventually killing them in the process.
Get ready for Mega Pulse Cannon - heal if you need to! Now Trauma will attack
you physically three times in a row before again using Mega Pulse Cannon. Then
he will again create two Dromas (he may do so infinity times) and pattern
starts to repeat itself. Dromas are not very dangerous by itself, but they are
quite fast - do not underestimate them. Understood so far? Then waste Trauma!

Draw Leviathan if you don't have him already.

Victory Fanfare! Congratulations!

type (magical, physical) of attack Krysta has received)

4. Ultima --> AT No-element class MA --> desperation class move --> used by
Krysta as a last attempt to kill your members

---------------------
#3003 - BOSS STRATEGY
---------------------

Quick victory way:

Meltdown on Krysta, take the (Counter rocket) punishment, Aura on Squall, Renzo
on Krysta (guaranteed to go down in one Renzo), take Ultima punishment, victory
is yours.

Professional victory way:

Krysta is poor in the field of offense, but counterattacks are where her real
strength lies. Any type of damage to Krysta will prompt her to launch a
devastating (Counter rocket) at the member who attacked her last.
Luckily for you Krysta has extremely low HP. Few good attacks and she's a
goner. Take note however to be at a so-so high HP when Krysta bites the dust
(I'm talking about Ultima) - you don't want to die just as you have won, right?

Draw Carbuncle if you don't have her already.

Victory Fanfare! Congratulations!

---------------------
#3103 - BOSS STRATEGY
---------------------

Quick victory way:

Meltdown on Gargantua, Aura on Squall, Renzo on Gargantua (guaranteed to go
down in one Renzo), victory is yours.

Professional victory way:

Do not attack Gargantua physically or you'll quickly feel the wrath of Counter
Twist. With no protection Evil-Eye is a really annoying attack (Curse and
Slow). Have Esunas and / or Remedies at hand to heal this statuses. Berserk and
Silence are also two annoyances that you should be careful of, should you not
possess right junctions. At least be protected against Berserk. Quake is no
biggie, just have Quake on El.Def.J.
Counting all this, Gargantua may seem to be a hard enemy... but take a look at
its HP. BAM BAM BAM! Dead Gargantua!

Draw Cerberus if you don't have him already.

Victory Fanfare! Congratulations!

---------------------

Quick victory way:

Meltdown on Catoblepas, Aura on Squall, Renzo on Catoblepas (repeat if needed),
take Meteor punishment, victory is yours.

Professional victory way:

Put Darkness on Catoblepas and his Deadly Horn and (Claw swipe) will hardly
make contact. As far as Thundaga and Thunder Summon attacks go... Thunder class
magic on El.Def.J. And he also has low Vit making him look even more puny.
Meteor?  Shell your members before defeating Catoblepas. Counting all this, I
think we have next dead boss...

Draw Alexander if you don't have him already.

Victory Fanfare! Congratulations!

yours.

Professional victory way:

This battle is one of the easiest in the whole game. Simply junction Flare and
Protect magics on El.Def.J and you will nullify the damage done by Dark Flare.
So it's just a matter of patience before Tiamat bites the dust...

Draw Eden if you don't have her already.

--------------------
#I03 - BOSS STRATEGY
--------------------

Writing a strategy for this behemoth is something hard. While I do find Omega
easy and I now beat him without invincibility items with ease, it might be hard
for the others... Hopefully I'll be able to assist you in defeating this
sucker.

1. Your MAX HP must be 9999 HP.
2. If your junctions are not as the one mentioned above, leave and return
later.
Defend command is invaluable.
3. Have a decent supply of Megalixirs. Get those from Bahamut card.
4. You must have Death on St.Def.J if you're at levels that are multiple of 5.
5. Get rid of any elemental magic you might have on El.Att.J.
6. Aura Stones will assist you greatly. Do not waste Aura magic!
7. Turn the battle speed to medium. You're gonna need that time!
8. Make sure you have 100x AP Ammo.
9. Squall's and Irvine's Str-J should exceed 220 - preferably 255.
10. Have Eva-J at least at 25% - that way you won't be bothered much by Omega's
physical potshots (especially concentrate on Irvine for this strategy).

That would be it. Now here's the strategy.

I bet you've noticed the rope hanging down from ceiling on right stairway and a
strange cloud in Chapel room. That be Omega.:) Have the other party pull the
rope. 58 seconds timer will start. Once you gain control of other party again,
quickly move to nearby party switch point and switch to the team that will
fight Omega.

Quickly run to Chapel. Omega is there, waiting for you... Commence battle!

First thing to consider is that Omega's attack pattern is a fixed one! Only
exception are his physical attacks which are randomly thrown here and there
during this fixed attack pattern.

Not counting physical attacks here's how Omega's pattern looks like...
--> Lv5 Death
--> Meteor
--> Megido Flame
--> Gravija
--> Terra Break
--> Ultima
--> Light Pillar
--> Meteor
--> Megido Flame
--> Ad infinitum

So how can we deal with this pattern and still make it thru?

A) LV5 DEATH
When you commence battle with Omega, his first 'serious' attack will be Lv5
Death. Death on St.Def.J will take care of this.

B) METEOR
Will be used after Lv5 Death. Since it's no-element class magic, only high Spr
and Shell status will cut the damage - but if Spr status is high, you shouldn't
even be bothered.:)
--> After the animation is finished, do the following: have Squall use 1x
Megalixir to heal to full health, have Quistis (or Zell) cast Meltdown on
Omega. Irvine is at standby.

C) MEGIDO FLAME
Will be used after Meteor. Your health must be at 9999 HP. If it's a single
digit lower, such member is KO-ed.
--> All three members will now be at 1 HP. Have Squall unleash Renzokuken, have
Irvine open Armor Shot at Omega, have Quistis use Shockwave Pulsar (have Zell
use Duel).

D) GRAVIJA
Will be used after Megido Flame. Good thing about Gravija is that it can't kill
you no matter how hard you try.:) Member with 1 HP will take zero (0) damage
from Gravija.
--> Have Squall unleash Renzokuken, have Irvine use Defend, have Quistis use
Defend (same if using Zell).

E) TERRA BREAK
Will be used after Gravija. This is Omega's most fearsome attack - which is
actually quite easy to 'bypass'. Since Quistis and Irvine are Defending from
Omega's last move, they will survive. Why? Because Terra Break is physical
attack and Defend will totally nullify the damage. Terra Break does 12 hits (I
think so) and they are randomly distributed among your members.
--> Chances are Squall was KO-ed - have Quistis (same if using Zell) cast Life
on Squall, have Irvine use 1x Mega-Potion (will restore 2000 HP to all
members).
--> Squall somehow survived - have Squall unleash Renzokuken, have Quistis use
Shockwave Pulsar (if using Zell have him unleash Duel), have Irvine use 1x
Mega- Potion (will restore 2000 HP to all members).

F) ULTIMA
Will be used after Terra Break. Since it's no-element class magic, only high
Spr and Shell status will cut the damage - but if Spr status is high, you
shouldn't even be bothered.:) Ultima shouldn't cause more than 1200 damage to a
single member - meaning they will still be in yellow.
--> Have Squall unleash Renzokuken, have Quistis cast Shockwave Pulsar (if
using
Zell start Dueling), have Irvine open Armor Shot.

G) LIGHT PILLAR
Will be used after Ultima. If you're not Invincible, there's nothing you can do
to survive Light Pillar. One member is sure to get KO-ed.
--> If Squall was KO-ed - have Quistis (same if using Zell) Revive Squall, have
Irvine use 1x Megalixir.
--> If Quistis (or Zell) was KO-ed - have Squall Revive Quistis (or Zell), have
Irvine use 1x Megalixir.
--> If Irvine was KO-ed - have Quistis (same if using Zell) Revive Irvine, have
Squall use 1x Megalixir.

H) METEOR
Will now be used after Light Pillar. Since it's no-element class magic, only
high Spr and Shell status will cut the damage - but if Spr status is high, you
shouldn't even be bothered.:)
--> Have Squall use 1x Megalixir to heal to full health, have Quistis (same if
using Zell) and Irvine on standby.

I) MEGIDO FLAME
Will be used after Meteor. Your health must be at 9999 HP. If it's a single
digit lower, such member is KO-ed.
--> All three members will now be at 1 HP. Have Squall unleash Renzokuken, have
Irvine open Armor Shot at Omega, have Quistis use Shockwave Pulsar (have Zell
use Duel).

J) AND SO ON UNTIL OMEGA'S MISERABLE DEFEAT

But it will take quite a long time, since he has over one million HP and he
won't split so fast as you want him to.:)

If you're not 100% guaranteed to win with this strategy without ever again
needing Invincibility items...

Victory Fanfare! Congratulations!

#3402f - ULTIMECIA'S MOVES
--------------------------

No moves! Except for being guilty to appear.:)

---------------------
#3403 - BOSS STRATEGY
---------------------

If I never see any more sorceresses, it'll be too soon. Junctioning properly
will prove mightily useful in this first part of the fight. Almost everything
can be absorbed, however... If Ultimecia uses Double on herself, Dispel it. If
Ultimecia uses Maelstrom, be sure to have Aura or Pain on St.Def.J so that you
won't be inflicted with Curse as well. If a character of yours gets Vit 0-ed,
Esuna or Treatment will take care of it. Anyway, Ultimecia is not too strong
and will fall quickly...

Ultimecia: 'The most powerful GF...'
'...You shall...'
'...SUFFER...!'
'HAHAHA...'

Oh boy, I have to defeat a ring of mine? Draw is pretty annoying as Griever can
steal some useful magic from you - only way to prevent him from doing that is
defeating him quickly and swiftly. (Blow away stocked magic) is even more
annoying as it can seriously screw up your junctions if say Ultima gets blown
away... Doom will be countered by Treatment, Elixir or Megalixir - no biggie.
If Griever Triples himself, Dispel it ASAP!
If you don't have high enough Spr (that would mean that you're worried about
your HP), make sure you keep 'em up most of the time. Casting Shell will help
tremendously. Again, assign one member to be a medic for this fight.
You'll see a change in background when Griever is about to use Shockwave Pulsar
(if you defeat him before he is even able to use it, Shockwave Pulsar will be
used as a desperation move)...

Ultimecia: 'The GF's true power...'
'Allow me...'
'To show you...!'
'Griever! Make them bleed!'

I really hope you listened to my advice and you have at least a decent Spr-J...
or else it's sure you'll be wiped out by Shockwave Pulsar. Anyway, you know the
drill... Meltdown on Griever, Aura on Squall, Renzo on Griever (might need
three or four if no finisher appears), take Shockwave Pulsar punishment and
sayonara to Griever...

Ultimecia: 'I shall junction myself...'
'...Unto Griever!'

Oh man, it's still not over... This form of Ultimecia is rather dangerous if
you dawdle around too long. If you let two Helixes appear, Ultimecia will start
using Great Attractor every other turn. She also gains access to Ultima and
Meteor. So why would you joke around and be pummelled endlessly...
If Great Attractor is imminent, cast Protect on your members to halve the
damage you'll suffer. Basically it's again - Meltdown on Ultimecia, Aura on
Squall, Renzo on Ultimecia and sayonara... oh, only half of it is gone... oh
well, another Renzo and...

Griever: 'Rghaah...'

Will you just die finally? Man, how much longer will you keep coming back?

Ultimecia: 'I am Ultimecia.'
'Time shall compress...'
'...All existence denied.'

Well, this is it. Truly the final boss of final bosses. This is the simplest
strategy for her defeat... Hell's Judgment is her cheapshot move to bring
everyone down to 1 HP. Have every member at standby until she uses Hell's
Judgment. Then have two members unleash their limits, whilst third one heals
with 1x Megalixir. Then be on standby again until next Hell's Judgment is used
- have Squall and Irvine use their limits and heal with Quistis. Repeat until
300000 of Ultimecia's HP is gone...
Sometime during the fight lower part of Ultimecia will become exposed. If you
don't kill it, upper part will Draw Apocalypse and will then use it against
your members - it's just a beefed up version of Ultima - nothing serious for
your junctions.

When you waste last ounce of Ultimecia's HP
Ultimecia: 'Reflect on your...'
'Childhood...'

She has more HP to lose...
Ultimecia: 'Your sensation...'
'Your words...'
'Your emotions...'

Still more...
Ultimecia: 'Time...'
'It will not wait...'

And more...
Ultimecia: 'No matter...'
'...how hard you hold on.'
'It escapes you...'

More...
Ultimecia: 'And...'

Congratulations! You've beaten the game!!!
