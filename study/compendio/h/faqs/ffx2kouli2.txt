<First Things>

- Major Credits To Final Fantasy X-2 Ultimania As This Guide Won't Exist Without It

- This Is Based On The Japanese Version Of Final Fantasy X-2

- The Whole Game Has About 110%
  - Choosing Youth League => 100%  (In One Game)
  - Choosing New Yevon    => 99.2% (In One Game)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<Introduction>

100% Story Level Completion? Yes. This Guide Is To Show You The Steps To Get 100% In One
Try, Meaning Right From The Moment You Click On 'New Game' Til You Beat The Game, You Can
Get 100%, Instead Of Playing The Game For Multiple Times To Do So. People Previously
Thought That Isn't Possible In One Try Because Of The Choices You Have To Make In The 
Beginning Of Story Level 2. But The FFX-2 Ultimania Said And Shown The Way To Get 100% 
In One Try. That Is To Choose Youth League In The Beginning Of Story Level 2. Now, Follow
The Guide If You Wish To Get 100% In One Try.

Side Notes:

- Doing This Will Also Get You The 'Perfect Ending'
- If You Choose New Yevon In The Beginning Of Story Level 2, The Max Percentage Is 99.2%
- Doing This Will Also Get You Episode Complete In Every Area Of Spira In Story Level 5
- This Also Means That You Will Get One Of Every Dress Sphere In The Game In One Try
  - However, You Could Still Miss Dark Knight and Samurai. Just Don't Forget To Pick 
    Them Up
- This Could Also Be Called A "Master Saved File" For One's First Game

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<One Simple/Important Rule>

- DO NOT SKIP ANY SCENE In Getting 100% In One Try -

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<Negative Areas & FAQ>

-- "Insert Doubts" --

- This Is From Official Source - Final Fantasy X-2 Ultimania. If You Are Going To Doubt 
  Square Enix, Why Bother Doing It Or Looking At This FAQ? Better Yet, Why Are You Even
  Playing Their Game?

-- Is This Copied From BradyGames' Final Fantasy X-2 Official Strategy Guide? --

- No. This Guide Was Created Sometimes After The Release Of Final Fantasy X-2 
  Ultimania. The BradyGames' Final Fantasy X-2 Official Strategy Guide Didn't Even 
  Exist Back Then. The Reason That This Guide And Bradygames' Guide Are Similar Because
  Both Guides Are Created Based On Official Source. BradyGames' Was Directly From The 
  Officials While Mine Was Indirectly From The Official Through The Ultimania. This Is
  Not Copied From BradyGames' Guide. If You Do Want To Accuse, Accuse BradyGames' Copied
  Mine Since This Guide Was Created Way Before Their Guide. So Next Time, Before You 
  Accuse, Have Something SOLID First.

-- Is This Copied From The FFX-2 Ultimania? --

- No. The Information In This Guide Used FFX-2 Ultimania As The Source And Created This 
  Summary. This Is Created Based On My Testing Through The Guide In The FFX-2 Ultimania
  And That's Far From Copying. If It's Copied From The Ultimania, It Will Be In Japanese
  And Also Have Far More Details. Even If It's TRANSLATED Word For Word From Ultimania,
  That's Not Exactly A Crime Since Translation Can Never Be Perfect Nor Exact, Not To 
  Mention I Credit Them Instead Of Take From Them And Say It's My Work. And Yes, If 
  It's Word For Word, You Won't Be Able To Undetrstand It Since Japanese Has Different
  Grammar Structures. So Next Time, Before You Accuse, Have Something SOLID First.

-- Can You Skip Scenes? --

- No. It Affects The %.

-- Can You Skip Text Or Dialogue? --

- As In Pressing Button To Fasten The Text Or Dialogue? Yes, Excepts For The Talk With
  Meichen At Story Level 1 / Chapter 1. You Can't Interupt His Talkings.

-- Does It Show The Decimal / Any Ways To Check It? --

- Sadly Enough, No. You Just Need To Know It By Heart Or Use A Whole Integer To Check 
  It, Such As (6.0), (13.0), (14.0), (15.0), (19.0), (30.0), (31.0), (37.0), (47.0),
  (50.0), (52.0), (63.0), (72.0), (73.0), (82.0), (85.0), (89.0), (92.0), (96.0)

-- Does It Work? / It Doesn't Work / It Isn't Working / Fix Your Guide / E-Mailing --

- Put It Short, It Does Work! Any Comment Relating To Fixing My Guide, Doubting My Guide
  And Any This Kind Of Things Will Be Ignored. I Only Help Questions Related To Your 
  Game Not Hearing Ones To Tell Me Fix My Guide And Saying The Guide Isn't Working.

-- Does It Apply To The NA Ver? --

- Yes, It Should. It Works In The Japanese Ver And It Should Also Apply To The NA Ver 
  Since NA Ver Is Based On Japanese Ver.

-- You Fixed Your Guide? / Did You Fix Your Guide ?--

- No. Since There Isn't Any Screw-Ups In The Guide To Begin With, Why Would I Waste My 
  Time And Fix It. The Recent Updates Were Merely Adding Additional Informatiom, Not
  Fixing. I Won't Need To Fix It Since There Isn't Anything Wrong With It.

-- About Akagi Sphere 4? --

- Yes, In My Akagi Sphere Guide, It Says You Get It Chapter 5 But However, You Can Indeed
  Get It In Chapter 3

-- You Got The Akagi Sphere / Crimson Sphere Numbers Wrong! --

- No, They Are Correct. In The Game, The Akagi Sphere Are Numbered In Two Ways. When You
  First Get Them, That's One Set Of Numbers. But In Shinra's Sphere Collection List, He
  Has Another Set Of Numbers For It.

-- Lack Of Details? / That Part Is Wrong! --

- This Isn't A Step By Step Walkthrough. I Only Listed The Important Steps. This Is More
  Of An Outline. And None Of The Parts Are Wrong. It's Merely Your Own False 
  Interpretation. If You Feel Strongly About It, E-Mail Me.

-- AirShip Or Walk? --

- When I Tested The Guide In Ultimania, I Used The AirShip All The Way. Meaning That This
  Guide Is Assuming You To Do The Same.

* Final Comment About E-Mailing To Me *

- All Useless Complains Will Be Ignored. I Only Help Your 100% In One Try, Not Hearing
  You Complain About My Guide.

This Is For People That Have Done 100% In One Try.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<About My Guide>

- My Guide Listed You The Important Steps To Gain 100% In One Try, But That Doesn't Stop
  You From Being A Perfectionist. Do Check Out The Game More Than What I Said Here Such 
  As Talking To Everyone In The Game From Time To Time Unless It Hurts The %

- You Might Wish To Make Couple Saved Files For This 100% In One Try Since You Could 
  Miss % Easily, Especially On Chapter 4 For Viewing Those Communication Sphere
