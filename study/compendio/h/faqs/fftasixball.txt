The infamous Capture:
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Capture is a useful ability, not only does it capture a monster for your
monster bank, and give you souls to use with your morpher, but it also removes
an enemy from the battlefield. Capturing monsters is also a prerequisite for
mission #100 (fiend run). In order to get that mission you MUST capture at
least 5 monsters, and then the operator of the monster bank will post a request
in the pub after you visit him. Now in order to use capture, several things
must happen, most obviously you need the capture ability. In order to use this
ability correctly, it can only be used on injured monsters (i.e. they cannot
have full health). Now don't be discouraged when you do this, the maximum
percentage you'll ever get for catching a monster is 24%. Just as another side
note, sleep, stop, blind and the direction you attack from have no effect on
the percentage to capture a monster. The way this percentage works is based on
the percentage of life remaining on the monster, at half health you'll have
12%. (If you really wanted to get technical, just take a monsters max hp and
divide by 24, this number is the amount of hp you have to take off in order to
get a 1% increase in your capture attempts). There are a few special cases for
capturing monsters:
> Any undead monster (zombies, vampires) cannot be captured.
> Any rockbeast monster (bladebiter, toughskin) cannot be captured.
> Any fairy monster (sprite, titania) cannot be captured.
> Any tonberry monster (tonberry, masterberry) cannot be captured.
> The monster you are catching cannot be the last enemy on the field.
> The monster you are trying to catch cannot be ko'd.
> The monster may be special, and in turn simply uncatchable.

Faq's:
''''''''''''
1- How come I cannot catch this ______ monster?

a- Well there can be several reasons why you cannot catch the monster, it is
either the last living monster on the field, it is a class of monster that
cannot be captured (undead, rockbeast, fairy, tonberry) it is Ko'd, or it is
simply just uncatchable (it may be a special monster)

2- How come my hunter has such a low capture percentage?

a- Because capturing monsters not only helps you build a good morpher, it alos
removes an enemy from the battle, therefore it is not necessarily an easy thing
to do. Compared to parley and other abilities that cause enemies to leave,
capture is really effective.

3- Do you use Hunters?

a- I personally only use hunters to capture monsters, I'm a perfectionist and
in turn want to catch at least one of every monster, and I have dreams of
creating a morpher with 999 for every stat.

4- Are hunters Only good for capturing?

a- Not necessarily, they seem kind of reminiscent of a ranged fighter, and they
do have an ultima ability.

5- Whats the best way to capture a monster?

a- Try to use units that are roughly the same level as the monster, and a high
level hunter; this way you can widdle its hp as close to 0 as possible. Blue
mages with abilities such as twister, matra magic and hastebreak make excellent
companions to your hunter. Abilites such as twister, demi, etc are also good to
use to get rid of Hp without killing your target. After you have 24%, try and
use abilities that make it unable to act, or blind it. This way you have the
time to try and capture the monster without worrying about taking to much
damage. Also try and keep damaging reaction abilities (strikeback, counter,
etc.) off, as it seems monsters like to attack these people and die, not
allowing you to capture them.

6- Are there any monsters that i can miss?

a- The goblin, and the thundrake only appear in unrepeatable missions, and
after those are done, you cannot catch them anywhere.
