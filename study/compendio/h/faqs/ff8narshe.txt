Introduction
============

 Welcome to my Final Fantasy VIII Devour guide. This guide will help you make
the Ultimate Party! The devour ability allows you to transform an enemy into a
number of different abilities and or stats that permanantely boost a character.
Some enemies deal damage though, so you must be careful. This ability takes a
lot of patience, but in the end, is well worth the time and effort. This faq
will detail every enemy in the game as to what they can be transformed into
throughout the game.

 If anyone has to contact me with problems,questions, or anything else I have
missed, my Email address is bananaking686@aol.com I check my Email frequently,
so I will try to reply as soon as possible. Here is a list of things that need
to be figured out:

1 - Devour a cockatrice level 1-29. What does it do?
2 - Is there a set enemy that gives a Hungry Cookpot through the Angelo Search?
3 - Am I missing anything? Any devour abilities? Any creatures?

=============
How To Get It
=============

 You can get the Devour ability in one of four ways. The first way is to learn
the ability from the Guardian Force Eden. The second is to convert the PuPu
card into the Hungry Cookpot and use it on a GF. The third way is through the
Angelo Search sidequest, and the fourth way is to partake in the Chocobo
Forests sidequest. I won't go in depth into the Chocobo Forest sidequest
because there are better guides out there that explain a lot better than I ever
could.

 +------+
 | Eden |
 +------+

 To get the Guardian Force Eden, there are 2 qualifications that you must have.
You must be on Disc 3 and have the Ragnarock. Eden can be obtained by battling
through the Deep Sea Research Facility and drawing it from the Monster Ultima
Weapon. The Deep Sea Facility can be found in the far South West corner of the
world map. For a walkthrough, look to the other guides as they have much more
information than I could ever put into this guide.

 +-----------+
 | PuPu Card |
 +-----------+

 To obtain the Pupu Card, you must be on Disc 3 and have the Ragnarock. You
must then complete the Alien Encounter Sidequest. While fighting enemies on
Disc 3, you may encounter a UFO that will be carrying a certain object. This
UFO can be found in some specific places around the world and after
encountering it a certain amount of times, you will encounter an Alien. After
this encounter, you will receive the PuPu Card. Following is a list of items,
locations of the UFO, and the objects that it carries in each battle.

ITEMS - Elixer x 5

 LOCATION 1: Winhill Bluffs
 OBJECT 1: Cow

 LOCATION 2: South of Timber - Mandy Beach
 OBJECT 2: Easter Island Statue

 LOCATION 3: Island on East side of the Centra Continent - Kashkabald Desert
 OBJECT 3: Pyramid

 LOCATION 4: Peninsula East of Trabia Garden
 OBJECT 4: Symbol

 After meeting the UFO in all 4 places, fly to the plateau North of the Chocobo
Forest that is close to Grandidi Forest and encounter enemies. After a few
battles, you should enter a battle with the UFO. After defeating it, you will
receive an Aegis Armlet. Yipee!

 Here's the important part. You MUST equip the Item command on one of your
party members to obtain the PuPu card. Also, this is where the 5 Elixers come
in handy. When you are ready, fly to the Balamb area and fight enemies on the
Alcauld Plains. You should encounter an Alien after a short while. Whatever you
do, DO NOT fight the Alien. It will ask you for an Elixer. Give it one, as well
as 4 more, and afterwards the Alien will give you the PuPu card and will take
off. Mission complete! Now use the Card Mod on the Card, and you will get the
Hungry Cookpot. Use the Hungry Cookpot on the GF of your choice and voila - the
Devour ability. Have fun!

**NOTE**
 You will lose the PuPu card forever if you choose to Mod it into the Hungry
Cookpot. Choose wisely.

 +---------------+
 | Angelo Search |
 +---------------+

 The Angelo Search is when, in a battle, you leave the characters alone and do
absoulutely nothing, after a period of time, 7 minutes or so, Rinoa's dog
Angelo will come on screen and dig for items. For this to work, Rinoa MUST be
in the party. Note that Angelo CAN come out and search more than once in a
battle. Be prepared for a long wait though, as the better items are found after
not doing a thing for a LONG time. I suggest you leave your console on and go
do something else for a while.
