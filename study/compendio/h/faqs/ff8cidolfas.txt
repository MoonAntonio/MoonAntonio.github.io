list; using the two in tandem gets you anywhere you want to go!

II. ITEMS

Refining items can result in either more items, or magic; if it's magic, it will be
marked with a *. Any option with an NR! next to it means that I don't recommend using it.
Most of Siren's Tool-RF and Carbuncle's Recov Med-RF will probably have this on it.
The format is: Item name, main item use (when applicable), other uses, then a *, then
how to get that item. The NR! will only appear in the uses for that item (above the *),
so first look at the item you want to refine! The items appear in the order that they
are shown on the item screen, NOT in alphabetical order. To find the item you want, 
use the "Search" or "Find" command on your browser or text editor (if you can make it 
match the case, remember that all the entries are in uppercase.)

I am not here to outline every single method of how to get every item. If I refer to
a quest, or am not clear enough on the exact details of acquiring a certain item,
please refer to the main walkthrough in GameFAQs, by Cephiroth (cephiroth@yahoo.com).

If you see "random" by a boss, that means that it drops that item or a different one
randomly.

TIPS:
-If the enemy you're trying to defeat/mug does not have the item you're looking for, try
using GF Tonberry's LV Up or LV Down skill. (Generally, the better items are received
from higher-level enemies.) Also try equipping GF Bahamut's skill "Rare Item" which also
affects mugging chances. Remember that if you mug a boss, you can no longer receive any 
items from it, so choose which one you want! The only exception is the magazine you 
receive from BGH251F2, and any cards.
-If you Card an enemy, however, you CAN still collect items afterwards (or, alternatively,
you can mug them and then Card them.) The payoff is usually double the amount of items!
-If you don't see a listed item offered at a shop, you need to learn GF Tonberry's 
"Familiar" ability.
-You can only have 100 of any item at any time, so remember that before you modify any 
cards which give you 100 of an item (e.g. Cerberus, Quezacotl); the excess items will
be discarded.
-Good luck!

III. MAGIC LIST

This is a comprehensive list of the uses of magic, their stat-raising abilities,
and where to find them. I'll only give one or two Draw Points and enemies who carry
the spell; I'm not going to list every single one. Here are the abbreviations
I'll be using: ED = Elemental Defense; EA = Elemental Attack; SD = Status Defense;
SA = Status Attack. The format is basically the same as the Items list, but there
are three sections: uses (main use and refining uses), stat raising, and where to
get it (the sections are separated by a *.) The values for stat raising are indicated
for when 100 spells are junctioned to the stat. The ones which are recommended are
marked with a ^. Note that every spell can only be gained from one type of refining
ability, so it will only be listed once.

Stat explanations: 
HP: Hit Points
STR: Strength (effectiveness of physical attack)
VIT: Vitality (defense against physical attacks)
MAG: Magic (effectiveness of magical attack)
SPR: Spirit (defense against magical attack)
SPD: Speed (rate at which ATB bar fills up)
EVA: Evade (chance of evading physical attacks - max of 100%)
HIT: Hit (accuracy with physical attacks - max of 255%)
LUCK: Luck (not accurately known - possibilities include critical hits, frequency of
      pre-emptive or Back Attacks, number of magic spells Drawn in battle, efficiency 
      of limit breaks, frequency of Odin/Gilgamesh summon, or some or all of the above)

TIPS: 
-To get the most magic out of a Draw Point or enemy, make sure the character
who Draws has a high Magic stat.
-You can only draw from an enemy or Draw Point if you are Junctioned with the
Draw command!
-As a rule, draw points on the overworld (which are invisible) yield less spells at
one time than ones in dungeons/towns, but they usually refill faster. See next entry.
-You can only draw 9 spells from one monster in a single turn, but monsters carry
unlimited spells. The best way to get magic in the game is to put a monster to sleep 
or some other status which renders it impotent (like Blind for physical monsters and 
Silence for magical ones) - using Doomtrain will work nicely in almost any case - 
and then draw as many spells as you want from it!
-If an enemy does not have the spell listed when you try, use Tonberry's LV Up
skill. A (HL) means that only high-level (above Lv.40 or so) monsters carry that spell.
-Spell groups (Fire, Blizzard, Thunder, Cure) almost always are carried by the same
monster and as the monster raises levels, so does the spell it carries.
-The higher-level spells are only kept by powerful enemies and so are tough to draw 
for them. The best way to get these is to go to the Islands Closest To Heaven and Hell 
(see section V), equip Diablos's Enc-None ability, and enjoy! Clean out one island, head
to the next one, and by the time you're done there, the first island will have 
regenerated! The spells you'll find are: Meteor, Ultima, Holy, Aura, Triple, Tornado,
Quake, and Full-life. Warning; you'll almost never receive more than 5 spells per Draw
Point on these islands, no matter how high your Magic stat is.

VII. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
-----------------

I know, this is supposed to be just an item and magic FAQ, but I'm getting a lot of flak
from this stuff, so I'll just outline the basic quests you'll need to get some of the
items mentioned here.

1. How do I complete the Chocobo Forests and what are they good for?

The basic idea is to use the ChocoSonar to find "hot spots" and the ChocoZiner to 
interact with them. The goal is to have only one chicobo left. When there's only one 
chicobo around, talk to it to find the mother chocobo.

-Sometimes the Sonar is very sensitive and will only give you a reading if you're in an 
exact spot. This can be very annoying sometimes!
-Blowing the Ziner causes some Chicobos to fall and some to rise. You have to experiment to 
see which one causes what. That's the challenge in the forests. Some spots cause only two 
chocobos to fall, for example, while blowing it again would cause four of them to rise.
-Talk to the Chocoboy for a hint: he'll tell you the name of the forest, which is usually 
fairly helpful. For the Solitary Forest, you'll have to wander around in the top-right area 
for quite a while until you manage to find the exact spot where the lone chicobo is hiding. 
For the Roaming Forest, you'll have to go almost all the way down to the entrance to find 
one of the chicobos.
-Once you've found the mother chocobo, don't get on it right away! Walk around some more 
with the ChocoSonar until you hit another spot; then use the Ziner to make the Chocobo 
search there. It'll dig up some Stones (Ultima, Protect, Flare etc.) and you will have 
completed the Forest. Oh, in one forest the Chocoboy is standing on the spot where you
have to search. If he seems perturbed about something, try to initiate a card game and
tell him to move.
-Completing all of the Chocobo Forests and entering the Chocobo Sanctuary will net you
the Chicobo card. Losing this in the Card Queen Quest will get you the Chubby Chocobo
card; modify it for 100 LuvLuvG's! The only other rewards you get are the Stones from
each individual forest, the ability to ride a Chocobo from completed forests, and the
satisfaction of using your brain a bit. 8-)

2. In Laguna's second dream sequence, do I have to open all three hatches? Can I get the
Old Key for good?

-It is a good idea to open all three hatches (you'll return here later as Zell 
and each hatch will have a great item inside). However, you can only open one manually. One 
will open by pushing the detonator (red switch, then blue) and another will open if you 
push the boulder you see (2 screens up from the detonator). I'm not sure if you can open 
them all after pushing the detonator in the wrong order. *^_^* Check Cephiroth's FAQ for 
more info.
-The Old Key is just there for amusement, as far as I know, and has no real purpose.

3. What's the Obel Lake Quest?

The following was copied directly from Cephiroth's FAQ (see credits).

When you examine the lake north of Timber, Squall will be presented with 2 options: 
- Throw a rock. 
- Try humming. 

Hum to have a shadow in the lake talk to you; it'll ask of Squall to locate a monkey. Head 
on over to the forest west of Dollet; run around a bit in there until a message pops up to 
say the animal was sighted. You may need to keep pressing the 'X' (U.S) or 'Circle' 
(Japanese) button for that to happen. Report back to the shadow and it'll hint at the 
existence of 4 special rocks in the world. To get clues for the locations of all 4 rocks, 
have Squall throw a rock until it bounces six times [The game will say the rock has bounced
"many many" times. - ed.] (this occurs randomly) before humming again for the shadow. The 
4 locations are: 

1. Along the shores of Balamb. You'll have to find a rock with an inscription on it. 
2. The tiny island to the east of Timber, north of the Horizon Bridge. 
3. The cliffs south of Galbadia Garden (or what used to be the Garden). You have to land 
the Ragnarok on the cliff above the waterfall nearby. Examine the ground above the 
waterfall. 
4. The forest west of Dollet. 

Examine these locations with the 'X' (U.S) or 'Circle' (Japanese) to find the rocks. Each 
has it own unique inscription. When rearranged, you'll get a message from the 4 rocks about 
a hidden treasure in the plains north of Esthar. Pilot your Ragnarok over there, and comb 
the Mordred Plains. You can't trigger the hidden treasure event unless you locate all 4 
rocks first. There'll be tons of talking stones (Moais?) here; try to locate a red one, and 
go the opposite direction it tells you to. Keep searching and you'll eventually find a red 
stone which tells you that, "The treasure is not here." Examine the same area again to 
obtain a 'Three Stars' item, which grants a G.F. the 'Expendx3-1' character ability (use 3 
spells in a row for the cost of only 1). If you need a hint, I'll say it's located in the 
south-east of the plains, but not too far away from the center of it. Happy searching! It 
took me quite a while too. 

Apart from this event, the shadow will drop several other hints... one will be regarding 
another hidden treasure; head for Eldbeak Peninsula, which is on Trabia, north from Balamb.
Examine the tip of the peninsula to get an inscription: "TRETIMEASUREATMINOFFDEISLE" .
[The hint was "Take time off at Eldbeak Peninsula". Remove the words "Time" and "Off" from 
the inscription to get "Treasure At Minde Isle". - ed.] Fly the Ragnarok over to Minde 
Isle, which is a small island south-west of Esthar City. Search the southern regions of 
the island for a 'Luck-J Scroll'. 

"Back in the day, south of here, there used to be a small but beautiful village surrounded 
by deep forests. Everyone lived a happy life there." He's simply telling you about a 
forgotten village, located in a clearing in a strangely shaped forest to the east of Edea's 
Orphanage. Search the area to see Squall's comments, but you won't get anything for this. 

4. Where do I find Energy Crystals?

The easiest way to get them is to enter Esthar City after you finish the moon mission.
I can't remember the exact location, but it's on the left side of the city. Look for a 
man in black, crouching on the side of the road. Talk to him and he'll laugh, then a 
fight with an Elnoyle will start. You can beat him easily if you Junction Death X 100
to Status Attack, or almost as easily (but it takes a lot longer) by junctioning Sleep.
There's a good chance you'll get an Energy Crystal or two when you win. Leave the screen
and re-enter; the man will be there again! (Don't get confused - there's yet another man
crouching by the side of the road who'll laugh when you talk to him, but no fight will
begin. A man near him will say, "Poor guy, he's in shock" or something of the sort so you
know you're in the wrong place.)

5. Where can I find a Power Generator?

I have no idea why I get so much mail about this, since it's listed where it's supposed
to be. But to reiterate, the best way to get it is to complete everything in the
Frequently Asked Question #2 regarding the hatches. Later in the game, you'll reenter
Lunatic Pandora twice, once as Zell and once as Squall. If you've missed both chances, 
your only hope is to fight Blitz. This white enemy appears (not particularly often) in the 
forests near Edea's House. Very rarely, he'll drop a Power Generator. If you've fought him 
over 10 times and he hasn't dropped it, try Junctioning Bahamut's "Rare Item" ability. Good 
luck!

6. I have to mug a Malboro to get its Tentacles, but how do I counteract its status attack?

Malboros can be found on the Great Esthar Plains (before the moon mission) or on the
Island Closest To Heaven (see Enemy Location section) after getting the Ragnarok.

Here's a quote from Cephiroth's FF8 FAQ:

When you do encounter a Malboro (ugly green plants with a black mouth), 
the only malady from its 'Bad Breath' preventing the party from acting 
will be 'Sleep', so wait until the Malboro smacks you with a physical 
attack. Your primary goal will be to wake the character equipped with 
'Mug' up, so if the Malboro attacks someone else, have that someone 
else target your stealer, and have him/her steal from the Malboro
before you escape. You'll need 9 Malboro Tentacles in total. Use one of
them on Quistis for her to learn 'Bad Breath'. [1 more is for the Doomtrain GF, and 
the rest are for weapons. -ed.]

Alternatively, you can utilize Pandemona's 'Initiative' character 
ability. This allows the particular character to always start a battle 
with a full time bar; have your stealer equipped with this, plunder 
quickly from the Malboro and escape. Remember to cure your characters 
after the fight!

[You'll want to Junction Berserk to your Status Defense, if you can; if you have another 
space, try Sleep. Check the magic section for details on how to get these spells. -ed.]

7. What's the bell for in Ultimecia Castle?

You can use it to fight Omega Weapon.
The following is a small excerpt from Cephiroth's FAQ:

First off, take your main party and position them at the Switch Spot in
the Courtyard, outside the Chapel. Have the secondary party make
their way to the Eastern Stairway Hall of the castle, outside the Art
Gallery where the bell is. Ring it once, then quickly step into the
nearby Switch Spot. Proceed into the Chapel as your main party, where
you'll find Omega Weapon waiting for you.

7a. How do I beat Omega Weapon?

I'm warning you, you don't get anything awesome for beating him. My personal strategy
requires the Gilgamesh card, which can only be obtained by completing the 
Card Club quest in Balamb Garden and beating Card King. Use Card Mod to turn the
Gilgamesh Card into 10 Holy Wars. Now fight around by the Courtyard first, and have
everyone attack Squall until he either dies or turns critical. (If he dies, use a 
Phoenix Down to revive him so he's still critical.) Now junction all the best stats
to Strength and Speed for Squall, and make sure the other two characters have the Item
command, and some Meltdown and Full-Life spells. (It goes without saying that you'll
need the Lionheart weapon for this.) Note: I don't recommend having Auto-Haste on a
character; it screws up the time when the Holy War is used up. Now complete the excerpt 
from the above Q (regarding the bell) to enter the fight. Immediately use a Holy War on the 
party. Have one character cast Meltdown on Omega Weapon. Now have Squall continually 
unleash Renzokuken on Omega Weapon. Have the other characters do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Keep 
them around for the second the Holy War wears off, and have whichever one is there use 
another one. If your stats are high enough, 4 or 5 Holy Wars should do it.

8. What's the deal with the painting puzzle in Ultimecia Castle?

This is one of the most interesting quandaries I've ever seen in an RPG. Again, much
thanks, is an excerpt from Cephiroth's FAQ:

First: It's imperative you examine ALL 12 paintings. (There are 4 on the first floor and
8 on the second floor.)

            To solve the puzzle... try going up to the 2nd floor of
            the Art Gallery. You'll see a clock painted onto the
            floor below; take note of the numbers the hands point to:
            VIII, IIII, VI. The 'V' indicates you should select only
            titles beginning with 'V', while the following 'I's give
            you the exact number of 'I's in each correct title.

            So 'VIII' would represent 'VIvIdarIum', 'IIII' would
            represent 'IntervIgIlIum' and 'VI' represents 'VIator'.
            These are read in the order of hour, minute and second.

Just an aside (from me): Most real clocks with Roman numerals have IV for 4, not IIII 
(although the latter is indeed used a bit). 

9. Where do I find the Card Club members?

First, you have to win between 20-25 card battles within Balamb Garden before they'll allow 
you to play them. Each player appears in Garden, but won't play you until you've beaten
the one before them (you have to beat them in order).

The first player, Jack (a black-haired boy) is at the entrance to the Garden (where the 
Directory is). When you talk to him, he'll say something like "Have you heard about the CC 
Group?" If you've won the requisite amount of battles, his real name will appear when he 
talks to you, and he'll challenge you to a duel instead. 

The second member, Club (also a black-haired boy) is located in the hall near the 
dormitory. He doesn't always appear, so try entering and leaving the screen if you don't 
see him. If you talk to him he'll say "...".

Next is Diamond, actually a pair of girls, who appear in the same screen as Jack did.

Next is Spade, a man who appears just outside the elevator on the second floor. He doesn't 
appear often, so try entering and exiting the screen until he does appear.

Finally, talk to Xu on the bridge for the next battle. She has the Carbuncle rare card.
After you win, talk to Dr. Kadowaki in the hospital, then go to your room. Search your bed, 
choose "Leave me alone", then rest a few times, until you get the final battle.

Oh: anytime after beating Jack, you can go into the Training Center. You may have noticed a 
man who sells you items here (near the Draw point on the small lake). The man is actually 
Joker, a member of the CC Club. If you have the Battle Meter from Cid (I missed it the 
first time I played through the game), Joker will upgrade it for you if you beat him. He 
also has the Leviathan card.

As for beating the CC members, you don't get any items, but you can win some nice rare 
cards off of them. The final member has the Gilgamesh card, which can be modified for 10 
Holy Wars. Oh, and beating the CC Club opens the way to an awesome cheat which allows for 
unlimited Rare Cards in Disc 4.

10. How do I get GF Tonberry?

In the Centra Ruins, you'll fight tiny lizards named Tonberries. You can get one as a GF,
but it takes a lot of patience. You'll have to defeat the Tonberry King, but the tricky
thing is getting him to appear. You need to have 20 Chef's Knives in your inventory; he'll
then appear randomly after you defeat another Tonberry. One way to try it is to equip the
Mug and Card abilities. Then Mug the Tonberry for a Chef's Knife, then whittle down its 
HP until you can turn it into a Card. Modify the Card for another Chef's Knife! Act
quickly; if the Tonberry gets too close, it'll start instantly killing allies! Use
Meltdown and Squall's Renzokuken to hit it hard and fast. (If you find that you can't get 
his HP down quick enough, forget about Carding it and just Mug it (defeating it doesn't 
always yield a Chef's Knife, meaning you just wasted a battle!) You can't run from battles 
with Tonberries, and Quistis's Degenerator Limit doesn't work either. The Tonberry King 
himself isn't all that tough, but has a lot of HP. The Tonberry GF has some excellent menu 
abilities, and the LV Up/LV Down commands are a must-have. Summoning him is kind of 
useless, though.

11. Where's the best place to gain experience?

If you have the Ragnarok and you're up for some challenge, try the Island Closest To Heaven
or Hell (see Monster Location section). The enemies here are all Level 100. Take Quistis 
with you and keep her at critical status; use Degenerator (learned from the Black Hole
item) to kill off any enemy instantly. If you can hack it, petrify Squall so he
won't gain any experience, but make sure to first de-equip him of his GFs and give
them to the other characters. Good luck!

12. Where's the best place to gain AP?

The best place is Cactuar Island (west of Kashkabald Desert in Centra) but you can't go
there until you get the Ragnarok. However, there's a glitch that allows you to head there 
before that! Just dock at the beach on the west side of Kashkabald Desert, then walk
south (you have to go through a very small opening) until you're directly opposite Cactuar
Island. Go to the menu screen and you'll see that the game thinks you're actually on the
island, so you can fight Cactuars to your heart's content! Each Cactuar gives 20 AP, but
you must have a high hit % and speed. Squall's attack works well.

13. I accidentally deleted the Med-LV Up ability from Alexander's ability list. Can I get
   it back? Is there any other way of getting the Remedy+ item so I can call Doomtrain?

Unfortunately, you've screwed up. There's no way of reinstating many GF abilities,
and this is one of them. There's also no other way of getting the Remedy+ item (although
I don't know if you can get it in the Chocobo World sub-game). Rule of thumb: Never delete 
an ability which isn't easily regainable. The best abilities to delete are (in order of 
preference):
-low-level Character abilities. For example, you can delete Str+20% when you've already 
learned Str+40%. This does NOT hold true for GF abilities like SumMag+10%, because those
are cumulative, and still take effect even when the higher-level abilities are learned.
-the GF, Draw, Magic, or Item ability. Since every GF starts with these four, and they are
easy to reinstate, you can balance it so every equipped GF will only need one or two of
them.
-Never delete the Boost ability!

14. Where can I find the Lunar Pod?

After the moon mission on Disc 3 you can find Piet at the Lunar Pod; he has the 
Alexander card. In Disc 4, you can find the Card Queen there; she can and will play the
Phoenix, Chubby Chocobo, Kiros, Irvine, and Doomtrain cards. The Pod is near the southern 
end of the Abadan Plains of Esthar (but not RIGHT up against the shore). For a map 
detailing its exact location, check http://www.rpgclassics.com/ff8/map.html .

ICQ 38620654

Of immense help was Vercingetorix's (vercingetorix@chatpr.com) item, mugging, and 
battle spoil FAQs, without which this FAQ would probably never have happened.

Also used for reference, with much gratitude, was the original walkthrough by Cephiroth 
(cephiroth@yahoo.com) and the refining and magic section of Scott Ong's
(http://move.to/risland) FAQ.

The magic drawing info could not have been completed without the help of Scott Ong's
monster FAQ, also at GameFAQs. That's the place to look for the best monster list around!

Thanks to John Calvin (jexer@hotmail.com) for info on some of the Blue Magic.

The info for Silver Mail was sent in by four alert readers: 
Brian Purdy (psx_sage@hotmail.com), Eric Sawyer (Eekeric@aol.com),
Chris Kepler (chris@cathedral.mb.ca) and Sheryl Bryant (DoomzdayD@aol.com) . 
Thanks!

The verification of the Ribbon item was sent in by Talon12580@aol.com.
