     THE FFVI HUNTER'S QUICK GUIDE TO RAGES AND LORES  --  Version 1.5
                              by Jared Johnson

In case you're thinking "Why the heck do I need another Final Fantasy VI
enemies list?", let me explain what this is for.  I originally wrote this
file for myself, as a way to easily track the Rages that my Gau had gotten,
and to remember what Lores I did and didn't have (and from which enemies I
could get the ones I was missing).  Once I got done with the Chart, though,
I thought it could benefit other serious, as well as new, Final Fantasy VI
fans.

There is an additional benefit to this file--for the first time ever (as far
as I am aware--my apologies if I'm wrong), a complete Rages list (including
those elusive two near the top of the list) has been created.  The Chart is
arranged by name so you can more easily locate each enemy's entry.

Oh, and I tried to keep the Chart pretty simple--I didn't put HP counts or
anything of that sort on them because, not only would this clutter the Chart
up more than it already is, but you can easily get that info from any number
of sources.  All you really need are the names of the enemies and the "LORE"
column to use the Chart effectively.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


INSTRUCTIONS:
It's really pretty simple.  Just print the Chart off and have it with you
whenever you go to the Veldt to increase your Rage numbers.  Because the
enemies are in alphabetical order on the Chart, you'll be able to easily find
and write down what enemies you've Raged so far (as opposed to the normal
method of searching for the position of every single enemy on Gau's subscreen
to check whether you have that particular enemy's Rage yet or not).  If
you're like me, and you want to get a complete Rages list, then you can save
a ton of time with this Chart.

Tips on Using the Chart:
When using the Chart, I've found that it works best to write an "R" next to
an enemy's name, underneath the "R" column (in pencil!), whenever I've gotten
that enemy's Rage.  Enemies that have a "---" under the "R" column cannot be
Raged.  They are listed on the Chart because they either appear on the Veldt,
or they can teach Strago a Lore.  By the way, the numbers next to the "R"
column, in the “RAGESORT” column, show the order in which the enemies appear
on Gau's subscreen.  I numbered the enemies from left to right, then top to
bottom.  In other words, Guard gets #1, Soldier gets #2, Templar gets #3,
etc.  Enemies with no number in this column obviously don't show up on Gau's
subscreen.  This numbering system gives you another advantage--when you're in
the heat of battle, and you know what Rage you want but can't find it, just
look at the Chart and you'll be immediately able to discern where it is on
Gau's list.  Oh, and remember to save often!  You don't want to learn several
Rages, just to lose them all by dying suddenly.  Believe me, I've learned
from personal experience that this is not fun!

All About Rages:
Remember that you only get the Rages of the enemies on-screen whenever you
Leap, and the enemies who you defeat in the battle after which Gau shows back
up.  You will encounter any enemy on the Veldt that you have previously
fought against in the game, excluding most bosses and some regular enemies;
in order for it to appear, you must either have defeated the enemy previously
or successfully gotten away from it.  This does NOT include enemies that you
fight in the Colloseum--you will not find them on the Veldt until you fight
them elsewhere in the game.

Lores:
Numbers listed under the "Lore" column correspond to one (or more) of
Strago's twenty-four Lores.  Check the listing underneath the Chart for the
spells that correspond to each number.  If a number is listed next to an
enemy, then that enemy can teach Strago that particular Lore either through
fighting it, using its Rage in battle, or Sketching/Controlling it in battle.
In the future, and if the demand is great enough, I plan to show which is
which.

Other Stuff:
By the way, this file was originally created in Microsoft Works and it best
displays in spreadsheet format.  Notepad really mutilated this file!  If you
would like an original copy of this file (which looks great IMHO), then email
me and I'll gladly send you one.  My email address is at the end of this
file.

I've spaced this file so that the Chart will begin at the top of the next
page whenever you print it.  I'm assuming that you're printing it at 60 lines
per page, which is pretty typical for a page with 1" margins all around.
It's spaced at the other end to allow for this as well.  I thought you might
appreciate my consideration.  :)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


NOTE:  Enemy #256 of Gau's Rage List, according to the FFVI enemy ROM data,
should be Pugs.  However, Pugs is not Rageable.  In other words, 255 Rages
are available and the final space on Gau's subscreen will remain blank.  In
addition, #56 (Siegfried), #65 (Chupon), and possibly #188 (Allo Ver) do not
normally appear on the Veldt.  You may only Rage them, as far as I know, by
using Game Genie codes.  Also, I'm not too sure about Chupon's Rage attack.
"W. Wind" is my best guess on that one.  Are there any other possibilities?
I can't think of any, unless you get to use Sneeze.

Special thanks to Anonymous (whoever posted the FFIII Enemy List at RPGamer
on March 10) for his/her info on Chupon and Pugs.  This list really made
completing the Rages list easy!  It's got all (or at least most) of the other
info--HP counts, etc.--that you may want to know about FFVI enemies.  Also,
special thanks to whoever came up with the original three Game Genie codes
that I have listed down below.  I'm sorry but I don't remember the source of
those codes.  In addition, in some instances I used data from Nintendo
Power's Final Fantasy III Player's Guide.

If you find a mistake, please tell me!  Believe it or not, I'm fairly new to
the FFIII world.  I've checked the below Chart several times but I still
could have something wrong.  Don't hesitate to tell me, no matter how minor
the mistake is.  Also, this is the first file I've submitted to be posted
online.  Please tell me what you think.  Is this something you can't do
without?  Is it totally useless?  I'd like to improve/change it as needed but
I must have feedback to do that.  Thanks.  And now, finally, on to the good
part!

TO GET A COMPLETE RAGES LIST:
Most enemies you can Leap normally.  However, Chupon, Siegfried, and Allo Ver
do not, to my knowledge, appear on the Veldt.  Yet they each have a Rage.
How do you access their powers?  You must use Game Genie codes.  Below I have
written out how I got the Allo Ver and Siegfried Rages.  As far as I know, no
one has come up with a way to Rage Chupon yet.  Stay tuned.  If one is
discovered I'll put it in my update.  For both of the following two tricks,
you need to save the game file you want to "alter" on the Veldt.


To Rage Siegfried (#56):  (Game Genie code CE17-7DD6 or CE37-7DD6)
If you plan to Rage both Siegfried and Allo Ver, you need to do this one
first.  That is because, if you try to Rage Allo Ver first, then Siegfried
second, Allo Ver's entry will be erased.  Enter one of the two Game Genie
codes I've listed above--depending on your version of FFVI only one of them
may work--and open up the file you saved on the Veldt.  Make sure the Game
Genie is on.  Now, to get this trick to work, you need to equip an Esper on
a member of your party.  It doesn't matter which Esper you use.  Be sure Gau
and at least one other person is in your party.  Walk around on the Veldt
until you encounter a group of enemies.  Defeat the enemies (it doesn't
matter which ones they are) and wait for a little while--your characters will
do the victory dance quite a bit longer than usual, but this is to be
expected.  The game has not frozen.  After a minute, the game will report
that each of the characters in your party have learned all Esper-type spells
that they have not already learned before this point.  Once you get out of
the battle screen, check out Gau's subscreen.  Every eighth Rage--plus some
odd ones here and there--will appear, but all other Rages that were learned
before this point will be gone.  Among the Rages Gau now has is the Siegfried
Rage.  Oh, and one side effect of this code is that your game file settings
are fried--in other words, you will have to reset your action/wait selection,
window color, etc.  But that's a small price to pay. 

After further experimentation with this code, I have found that there is a
way to avoid the side effects I have listed above.  Simply wait to turn your
Game Genie on until you find a group of enemies that will not give you any
Magic Points.  You will not gain any additional spells and your game settings
will remain the same as before the battle, but you will still gain the same
Rages.  The Rages that you will get if you use this code are marked with an
asterisk on the Chart.


To Rage Chupon (#65):
Heck if I know!  I'll be sure to fill in this section as soon as I figure out
some way to get Chupon's Rage.


To Rage Allo Ver (#188):  (Game Genie code 8AA3-846D or 8A03-846D)
If you plan to Rage both Siegfried and Allo Ver, then please read Siegfried's
section first.  For this Rage, basically all you have to do is enter this
code, start your game, and walk around until you encounter an Allo Ver.  Then
Leap him.  That's it.  One remark though--if you don't encounter Allo Ver
within the first ten enemy groups, then it will probably be a LONG time
before you find one.  So you may want to reset your game to "randomize" the
Veldt again.  I was lucky for this one because my third enemy was an Allo
Ver.  Yours might take longer.


To Rage Io (#255):  (Game Genie code 74A3-846D or 7403-846D)
Some people say they are having trouble finding Io.  If you are, then use the
above Game Genie code and follow the instructions listed for Raging Allo Ver.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


RANDOM THOUGHTS:
What happens if Gau is the only person in your party and you Leap an enemy?

What happens if you Vanish/Doom Phunbaba in the battle that Terra is destined
to lose?  (It CAN be done!)

Wouldn't it be great if Chupon's Rage was Sneeze?  You could instantly get
rid of any enemy!

Try Gau's Retainer Rage out...Remind you of anybody?

Have you ever tried Sketching/Controlling Gau?

The best way to Rage self-destructing enemies such as Earthguard and Peepers
is to equip one member of your party with the RunningShoes Relic, and then
have that member cast Stop on the enemy before it self-destructs.  Or, if you
are lucky, Gau will return after you’ve met one of this type of enemy.

Obviously this isn't a complete Final Fantasy VI enemies list.  It is not
meant to be.  It is merely a guide to help you on your quest to obtain all
Rages and/or Lores.  There are plenty of other resources available on the
Internet if you wish to find a complete enemies list.

I am not certain how the Final Fantasy VI re-release will affect the above
data.  I am assuming it will remain the same; however, this chart is meant to
be used only with the original version of Final Fantasy VI.
