 AUTHOR'S NOTE
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Hi, welcome to my newly-revised FF7 FAQ.  I rewrote the entire thing
 from scratch, a process which took an ungodly amount of time to finish.
 I had been wanting to do this for a long time, but nothing drains your
 enthusiasm like plagiarism, and lord knows there was enough of that to
 go around a few years ago.  This FAQ was reprinted in several European
 mags thanks to the hellspawned Future Publishing Co. Ltd, and I had to
 deal with the (thankfully now defunct) Game Cave giving it away as a
 "gift with purchase."  Nevermind the many idiots who would re-release
 this FAQ with their name on it, or sites that would mess with it and
 refuse to take it down (like CheatCC.com).  However, it was always my
 intention to rewrite the FAQ, and it's a good thing too, since v1.6 was
 in sore need of some editing.

 This FAQ was written for the English-text, Sony PlayStation version
 of Final Fantasy VII.  If you're playing the Japanese version, the PC
 version, or the "International" re-release, then I can't help you,
 sorry.

 If you have any comments or criticisms, or if you'd like to contribute
 some information, feel free to write to me at (k.megura at eudoramail
 dot com).  All game-related questions that are already answered in the
 FAQ will be ignored, though.  C'mon, it's a FAQ, that's what it stands
 for, "Frequently Asked Questions." :)  Just use a search/find option,
 type in what you're looking for, and see what comes up.  I have
 reformatted the FAQ in such a way that it's impossible to search for,
 say "Key of the Ancients" and not get a result of some sort (which was
 a rather infamous problem in the previous revision).

 Unfortunately, I've lost a directory of FF7-related mail that I kept on
 my computer, so if you sent in a contribution and I told you I was
 going to use it (but it's not in the FAQ by now), then it was probably
 erased.  I apologize for this, and if you want to take the time to
 re-send the information to me, I'll be glad to add it in the next
 update and credit you.  This is what happens when you wait six years
 before updating a FAQ....

 Finally, the FAQ has now been made into one text file, as opposed to
 two files previously (there used to be a walkthrough and an addendum
 file containing other information).  So, it's a lot easier to search
 for information, instead of having to dig through two files to find
 what you're looking for.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 REVISION HISTORY
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 VERSION 2.2  (May 16, 2004)
  - Added a contribution about a Magic Counter materia location that I
    missed, and made some minor spelling/grammar corrections.

 VERSION 2.1  (February 22, 2004)
  - Minor updates.  There are a few areas I wanted to touch up a little
    more, like the Materia section.  However, that may not happen anytime
    soon.  The two parts have been combined into one file for this
    version...I never liked having them split up in the first place.

 VERSION 2.0  (December 20, 2003)
  - The FAQ was completely rewritten from the ground up.  As of this
    date, Part 2 hasn't been released yet, but hopefully I can get it
    out soon.
    
 VERSION 1.6  (August 1, 1998)
  - More corrections.  Some sections have been re-added, too.

 VERSION 1.5  (June 24, 1998)
  - Some quick, minor corrections.

 VERSION 1.4  (June 8, 1998)
  - I decided to get back and correct the stuff that had been bugging me
    since January.  I've removed all contributor's e-mail address as some
    people out there (ahem, ahem), have been mass e-mailing these guys
    trying to get answers to questions already covered in this FAQ.  If
    anyone wants their e-mail address listed, drop me a line.  I'm
    planning to do a few more updates after this one, so if you notice
    any mistakes, lemme know and I'll correct them in the next update.
    The FAQ is a lot smaller now, as I weeded out useless information.
    Hope nobody minds...!
  
 VERSION 1.3  (January 1, 1998)
  - I'd like to thank WhisQ for providing me with a totally-revised
    Monster List--it's arguably one of the biggest and best contributions
    ever.  Other various things have been added and corrected.  Barring
    any new discoveries, this is the last revision of the FAQ.  I hope
    you enjoyed the ride, and I'd like to express my thanks to all the
    people who were there for me in the beginning, and those of you who
    were contributing up until the very last update.  Everyone who sent
    something into this FAQ is worthy of praise.  Well, that's it!

 VERSION 1.2  (December 14, 1997)
  - The Monster List has been revised, and more numerous corrections
    and additions have been made.  Hmm...anything left to add?  (Be
    reasonable now!)  I've been doing this since February, and I think
    the FAQ is as good as it's gonna get, right?  Well, let me know,
    otherwise, I suppose this is it.

 VERSION 1.1  (November 16, 1997)
  - The strategy section for the Ruby and Emerald Weapons has been
    updated, and of course, there have been more numerous additions and
    corrections.  I'm happy to say that much of the new stuff in this
    revision is the result of contributions by readers of the FAQ, so
    thanks!

 VERSION 1.0  (October 28, 1997)
  - The Walkthrough section has been updated for all three discs.
    Strategies for fighting the Diamond, Emerald, and Ruby Weapons have
    also been added, as well as many numerous corrections.  Much of the
    Japanese text has also been converted into English, along with other
    minor additions.  And with that, the FAQ is bumped up to 1.0, since
    it's now a 'real' FF7 English-text version FAQ. Also (as if you
    hadn't noticed) the FAQ has been split into two parts.

 VERSION 0.3  (October 6, 1997)
  - A minor update to the Walkthrough section, and more general
    corrections throughout the FAQ.  Lots of GameShark codes this time,
    however, I only made one of them, the 'Battle Select', the rest were
    submitted and contributed by Ignacio DeLucas, Jeff Wong, and Charles
    Mr. DeLucas gets big props for correcting my GS codes and submitting
    ones of his own (as I don't like making them, and he seems to be very
    good at coming up with them!! ^_^;)  I've replaced the 'Run from any
    battle' trick with the 'Exchange Gil for GP' trick as the former
    cheat doesn't work in the US version.  Also, several sections have
    been rewritten (since I had to rewrite them for another FAQ anyway).

 VERSION 0.2  (September 14, 1997)
  - More corrections made and more info. added.  Also included the 'Gain
    Lots of Experience Points', 'Super Select', and 'No Time Limit - Any
    Character' GameShark codes.

 VERSION 0.1  (September 7, 1997)
  - Basic information.  Much of this FAQ is based on my earlier Japanese
    FF7 FAQ.  Created GameShark codes 'Item Select', 'Materia Select' and
    'Character Select' have been included.  If the FAQ seems a bit sloppy
    right now, well, it is based on the Japanese FAQ so it'll take a
    revision or two to get everything into shape.
 
 VERSION 0.0  (August 18, 1997)
  - Began construction this FAQ, based on v2.0 of my FF7 Japanese FAQ,
    (which, in turn, was begun on February 14, 1997).

 Unfortunately, I don't have a copy of v1.4 - Part 2 of the FAQ (which

        Chuck Cochems, Frank Grayson, and Michael Geoff Bridge

 2. BASIC INFORMATION
 ========================================================================

 This section covers general information about the game, including a
 glossary of terms and an explanation of the game's controls.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 GLOSSARY
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In order to make the FAQ easier to read, many terms are used that may
 not immediately make sense.  This section defines some of those terms
 so that you will better understand them.  Please read this section
 before continuing with the rest of the FAQ.
 
 Battle
  - This refers to any time you are in combat with one or more enemies.

 Main Menu
  - Outside of battles, you can usually press the Triangle button at
    any time to bring up the Main Menu, which displays the members
    in your party and other options, such as "Equip", "Save", etc.

 Map
  - Any area that you can move around in, such as a town, cave, mountain,
    building, etc.  May also refer to the World Map.

 Materia
  - These are spheres that can be purchased or found at various places
    witin the game.  They can be attached to weapons and used in
    combat.  Some materia also function outside of combat, such as
    the "Enemy Lure" materia, which increases the chance of meeting
    monsters in particular areas.  Materia come in different colors
    and have different abilities.

 Menu
  - Refers to any kind of menu (a window in which you have the ability
    to move the cursor and choose a particular option.  This may include
    the Main Menu.

 PSX
  - A popular abbreviation for "PlayStation."

 World Map
  - At a certain point in the game, you will be able to move around
    freely outside of Midgar City in a 3D environment.  This is called
    the World Map, and differs from the Map in that the background is
    not static and moves as your character wanders around.

 for more information.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 CONTROL PAD FUNCTIONS
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The function of each button on the Control Pad depends on what mode
 you are currently in; Map, World Map, Menu, or Battle.  Please refer
 to the "Glossary" section above if you aren't familiar with these terms.

 CONTROL PAD
     Map   Use this to move your character around.
    Menu   Use this to highlight options, move the cursor, etc.

 X BUTTON (blue)
     Map   Hold this button and use the Control Pad to run instead of
           walk (in some areas, this functions in the opposite manner).
    Menu   Usually closes windows and menus, cancels choices, declines
           offers, etc.

 CIRCLE BUTTON (orange)
     Map   This serves as the "action" button.  You can use it to
           perform a variety of actions, such as talking to people,
           opening chests, pushing buttons, picking up items, climbing
           up ladders, jumping off ledges, searching areas, etc.
    Menu   This button confirms choices and advances conversations
           already in progress.
  Battle   Confirms decisions (such as what action your character will
           take, what spell they will use, etc.)

 TRIANGLE BUTTON (green)
     Map   Opens up the Main Menu.  Press X to close.
  Battle   Switches control from one character to the next, without
           making them take any action.  If nobody else's Time Gauge is
           full, pressing this button has no effect.

 SQUARE BUTTON (pink)
     Map   In areas where you automatically run, you can hold this button
           down while using the Control Pad to walk.
    Menu   Once you are able to use Materia, pressing this button while
           in the Main Menu will cause you to toggle between the Equip
           Menu and Materia Menu.
  Battle   This button can be held to make the Command Window disappear,
           so that one can see the Barrier and MBarrier gauges.  Release
           the button to make the Command Window reappear.

 START BUTTON
     Map   Causes the map display to appear, enlarge or disappear.
  Battle   Pauses the game.  Press again to unpause and continue playing.
  
 SELECT BUTTON
     Map   Pressing this button makes several markers appear onscreen.
           A red triangle indicates exits leading to other areas.  A
           green triangle indicates any surface that you can climb, leap
           off of, etc. (such as ladders or ledges).  In some areas, a
           white glove will appear over your character, so that you can
           tell where they are when they're moving behind objects and
           cannot normally be seen.  You can press the Select button
           again to make the markers disappear.  Note that the markers
           usually disappear every time you enter a new area, requiring
           that you press Select again to make them reappear.
  Battle   Displays the Help window.  Press it again to make the window
           disappear.

 R1 BUTTON (right front button)
     Map   Hold and use the directional pad to make your character move
           at a 45 degree angle to the right.
     Map   When on the World Map, holding this button while moving
           makes your character turn to the right.
    Menu   Scrolls item and magic menus downwards.
  Battle   Some abilities (such as spells), can affect more than one
           target.  You can press this button when using such abilities
           to target one or all enemies onscreen.
  Battle   If this button and L1 are held simultaneously, your party
           will attempt to run away.  Running away may take some time,
           and you cannot escape from all battles.

 R2 BUTTON (right rear button)
     Map   Toggles the camera angle in the World Map.
  Battle   Makes a target marker appear next to each enemy (or various
           parts of a multi-part enemy), so that you will have an easier
           time choosing which enemy to attack.

 L1 BUTTON (left front button)
     Map   Hold and use the directional pad to make your character move
           at a 45 degree angle to the left.
     Map   When on the World Map, holding this button while moving
           makes your character turn to the left.
    Menu   Scrolls item and magic menus upwards.
  Battle   If this button and R1 are held simultaneously, your party
           will attempt to run away.  Running away may take some time,
           and you cannot escape from all battles.

 L2 BUTTON (left rear button)
     Map   Toggles the camera angle in the World Map.

 SELECT BUTTON
     Map   Displays a hand pointer over your character, and indicates
           things you can interact with (like ladders) using green
           arrows.  Red arrows indicate exit points.  Can toggle on
           or off.
  Battle   Displays an information window.  Can toggle on or off.

 Finally, if you hold down all four shoulder buttons (R1+R2+L1+L2) and
 press Select + Start at the same time, the game will reset.  This
 feature cannot be used during battles.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 BATTLE COMMANDS
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ATTACK
 Choose this to attack an enemy with whatever weapon you currently have
 equipped.  After choosing this option, you have to highlight which
 enemy you want to attack.

 MAGIC
 This lets you cast a magic spell on a friend or foe.  After selecting
 what spell you want to use, you have to pick the target you want to
 use it on.  If you have an All materia paired with a Magic materia,
 you can press R1 to make the spell target all enemies or all members
 of your party.

 ITEM
 This lets you use an item from your inventory, either on yourself or
 on your enemies.  Not all items can be used during battle, though.

 CHANGE
 To access this command, press Left while the Command Window is open.
 When you choose this option, your current character will switch rows,
 moving into the back if they are in the front, or vice versa.  However,
 this only lasts for the duration of that battle (so if you get into
 combat later on, your character will be back in their original row).

 DEFEND
 To access this command, press Right while the Command Window is open.
 When you use this option, your character takes no action for that
 round.  However, they will take half damage from any attack they
 receive.

 There are other abilites you can use by equipping the appropriate
 Materia.  These are explained in greater detail in Section 9 of the
 FAQ.

 Occasionally after winning a battle, the enemy may leave behind some
 items.  You can choose the "Take Everything" option to collect all of
 the items, or you can move the cursor down and individually select
 which items you want to take.  You'll know if an item was taken, as
 it will appear in the right-hand window (labled "Item").  When you're
 done, choose the "Exit" option at the bottom of the screen.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 MENU FUNCTIONS
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ATB  (Active Time Battle)
 There are three possible settings for ATB: wait, recommended, and
 active.  In 'Wait' mode, the time stops when you're navigating through
 menus (such as for items or spells), and when actions are taking place
 (casting a spell, using an item, etc.)

 In 'Recommended' mode, time only pauses when you're highlighting a
 target (for example, when you want to attack an enemy or pick which
 ally you want to use a Potion on).

 In 'Active' mode, the time is always going by, and you will get attacked
 whenever your opponent is ready.


 ========================================================================
 3. DISC 1 WALKTHROUGH
 ========================================================================

 The walkthrough is divided into multiple sections for ease of use.
 Each section begins with a list of items you can find in that section,
 as well as other important information, if applicable.
                        
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (A)  Reactor No. 1
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Potion x4, Phoenix Down, Restore materia, Assault Gun.

 Equipped on Cloud:
  - Buster Sword, Bronze Bangle, Lightning materia, Ice materia.

 Equipped on Barret:
  - Gatling Gun, Bronze Bangle.
  
 After Barret runs away, you'll be able to control your character (who
 the game refers to as "Ex-SOLDIER").  Now is an excellent time to press
 the Triangle button to bring up the Main Menu.  If you check your Item
 listing, you'll see that you already have three Potions, a Phoenix Down,
 and an Ether in your inventory.

 As a side note, don't worry about your Materia settings for the time
 being.  That option will not appear in your menu for some time.

 The first thing to do is check the body of the guard nearest you to
 find two Potions.  You can do this by moving as close to the body as
 possible and pressing the Circle button.  If you're not sure where to
 go now, press the Select button.  This will make a red marker appear
 over any possible exits (in this case, there's one further down the
 platform you're on).  So, press Up to walk towards the exit.  Once
 you get close enough, two guards will run out and attack you, forcing
 you into battle.

 If you're new to the game and aren't sure how to win a battle, don't
 worry.  For now, just wait until your Time Gauge fills up.  When it
 does, a window will appear that lists three commands; Attack, Magic,
 and Item.  Choose "Attack" and highlight a particular enemy using
 the cursor, then press the Circle button to make Cloud attack.  You
 can simply repeat this method until both enemies are dead.  If you're
 worried about losing too much life, you can always choose the Item
 command, pick the "Potion", and use it on yourself.

 Once the battle is over, head towards the exit, which is at the end
 of the platform and to the west.  In the next area, head over to your
 companions and talk to them.  You will then be prompted to enter your
 name.  You can use the X button to go back a space, and the Circle
 button can be used to select a letter, number, or symbol.  Optionally,
 you can use the menu on the right to add spaces, delete a character,
 or use the default name.  When you're done, choose "Select" to return
 to the game.

 For the rest of the FAQ, I'll refer to the main character (and all
 other characters), by their default name.  In this case, our hero's
 name is Cloud.

 After Barret shows up, you'll have a chance to re-name him, too.  He'll
 then tell you how to run, using rather bad grammer.  The PSX version of
 FF7 is full of spelling and grammatical errors, thanks to Square's
 half-baked translation / localization job.  It's something you'll just
 have to get used to. :)

 In the next area, go north, then turn east, go north again, and turn
 west.  Keep going until you reach a door.  Note that when I say "north"
 in the game, I'm referring to the position relative to your character.
 In this area, "north" is actually to the upper-right corner of the
 screen.

 Past the door is an area shaped like an upside-down T.  Head west and
 then take the north path into the large opening in the wall.  You are
 now officially inside the reactor.  The enemies in here are nothing
 to worry about.  In fact, a particular enemy (the Sweeper) is very
 susceptible to Cloud's Bolt magic, so give it a shot.  Actually, all
 mechanical enemies take damage from lightning attacks, so keep that
 in mind.

 Anyway, in the following room, go over to your friends and talk to them.
 Barret will then join your party.

 The first thing you'll want to do is go to the Main Menu (use the
 Triangle button), then highlight "Order" and press the Circle button.
 Highlight Barret and press the Circle button again.  This will move
 his portrait to the right slightly.  You can now press X several times
 to exit back out.  What's the importance of this?  Well, you just put
 Barret in the back row, and characters in the back row take reduced
 damage from attacks.  Why Barret?  Since many of his weapons are
 long-ranged (and the Gatling Gun is one of them), he can fight from
 the back row without any penalties.  Other characters (like Cloud)
 have short-range weapons, and their attack power is reduced when they
 are put in the back row.  So, be sure to leave Cloud where he is, in
 the front.

 Now that Barret is in the back row, talk to Biggs (the man standing
 next to the wall panel), to get the door to open.  Then talk to Jessie
 in the next area to open the second door.  Instead of following her, go
 through the door, but head to the lower-right corner of the screen.
 This leads to a small antichamber where you can find a treasure chest
 containing a Phoenix Down.

 Now go back up to the main room and go to the right, where Jessie is.
 Talk to her, then go through the door to enter an elevator.  Inside,
 go over to the two triangular switches and press the Circle button to
 activate the elevator.  On the way down, Cloud will mention the
 "Roboguards," enemies that do not actually exist in the game. :)  Once
 the elevator stops, exit to the left.  You'll see a flight of stairs
 upon stepping outside, so follow Jessie down the stairs until you
 reach the bottom, and enter the nearby door.

 In the next area, head to the right to automatically jump over a gap
 in the floor.  Then, talk to Jessie.  To follow her down the ladder,
 continue to the right until you're close to the ladder, then press
 the Circle button.  Cloud will leap onto the ladder.  Now just press
 down to climb down.  After leaping off, if you look carefully, you
 will see a shiny purple object in front of Jessie (it's hard to spot
 due to the steam in this area).  If you pick it up using the Circle
 button, you'll see that it's a Potion.  Go down the stairs to your
 right and descend down the ladder as you did with the previous one.

 In the following area, head to the left and follow the pipe over to the
 wall.  If you press up when near the ladder that's attached to the wall,
 you'll leap onto it.  Climb down to the platform beneath you.

 Here, you'll notice a blue aura with a spinning shape over it that
 is shaped like this: "[".  This is a Save Point, where you can save
 your game.  To use it, simply walk into the aura, and a message will
 appear telling you that you've found a Save Point.  Now press the
 Triangle button to go to the Main Menu, and pick the last option,
 called "SAVE."  Then choose whichever slot your Memory Card is in,
 and pick an empty slot to save in by using the Circle button.  When
 you're done, press the X button several times to exit back out into
 the game.

 Now head south down the long platform to the next area.  Here, walk
 up to the small, shiny orb lying on the ground and grab it using
 the Circle button.  This will net you the Restore materia.  You
 can't use the Materia ability yet, so don't worry about it for now.
 Continue up to the machine at the end of the walkway, and Barret
 will tell Cloud to help him out.  Afterwards, you'll have to fight
 a boss, Guard Scorpion.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Guard Scorpion
                LV: 12        XP:  100       Steal:  <nothing>
                HP: 800       AP:  10        Morph:  <cannot>
                MP: 0         Gil: 100       Leaves: Assault Gun
                Weakness:   Lightning
                No Effect:  Gravity
                Ability:    Search Scope, Rifle, Scorpion Tail,
                            Tail Laser
                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   No. 1 Reactor

 This boss has two attacks; "Scorpion Tail," and "Rifle."  You can tell
 who the boss will use Rifle on, because it uses "Search Scope" on that
 character beforehand.

 After doing enough damage to the boss, it will raise it's tail over it's
 head.  As Barret advises, don't attack the boss until it puts it's tail
 back down, because if you do hit it, it will counter with the "Tail
 Laser" attack, which damages all characters.  Just keep choosing the
 "Defend" option by pressing left, then pressing the Circle button until
 the boss relaxes it's tail (optionally, you can use this time to heal
 hurt members with Potions or Phoenix Downs).  It's then safe to start
 attacking it again.

 The best way to defeat this boss is to have Cloud use his Bolt magic,
 while Barret attacks.  If your characters take enough damage, their
 Limit Break meters may fill up, and their "Fight" command will read
 "Limit."  Go ahead and try using their Limit Breaks, as they do a lot
 of damage.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 Now you have to exit the reactor before it explodes, which will occur
 in ten minutes.  You may want to spend a few seconds going to the Main
 Menu and equipping the Assault Gun on Barret, as it does more damage
 than his normal weapon.  Besides, you will have to fight enemies as
 you escape.  On the other hand, if it's too much to deal with right
 now, don't worry about it.

 To leave the reactor, simply retrace your steps.  Be sure to hold
 down the X button so that you'll run instead of walk.  Go back to the
 area with the Save Point (you can save if you really want to), climb
 up the ladder, and go back to the area where Jessie is.  Talk to her
 to help free her stuck leg, then follow her back out into the rooms
 with the sealed doors.  Here, talk to Jessie to open the first door,
 and Biggs to open the second one.  Follow them out of the reactor,
 then sit back and enjoy the FMV :)

 Once you're in control of Cloud, go over to the stairs and head up
 them, then go arond the building to the exit.  In the next area,
 you'll run into a girl selling flowers.

 Now, as much as I hate spoilers, this one is important, since the
 choices you make from now on will affect an event later on in the
 game, in which Cloud gets to go on a "date" with one of several
 possible characters.  If you want to make sure that Cloud ends up
 dating a particular character, I recommend that you go to GameFAQs
 (http://www.gamefaqs.com), and look under their section on FF7 FAQs
 for Terence Furguson's "Dating Guide."  This explains exactly how
 your actions determine who you end up dating.

 And if you don't care about any of that, then just tell the flower
 girl whatever you like :)  After talking to her, exit this area by
 going to the lower-right area of the screen.

 In the next scene, if you head south and look at the area near the
 lampposts, you will see a shiny object you can pick up, which is in
 fact a Potion.  By now you've probably guessed that anytime you see a
 shiny object lying around, it means that it is an item that you can
 take.  Once you have the Potion, continue to the south.

 In this next area, you will be confronted by several groups of Shinra
 guards.  You are given the option to fight them or run away, but if
 you don't pick an option soon, they will automatically fight you.
 Eventually, Cloud will escape by leaping onto a passing train.  Once
 you're inside the train and are in control of Cloud again, press down
 to walk towards the front of the screen.  Cloud will then hop into the
 next area of the train.

 In this area, go to the front of the train after the members of
 AVALANCHE have settled down and talk to Jessie.  When she finishes
 talking to you, move over to Barret, and he will start talking.
 Eventually, the train will stop and you'll all go outside.  Go south,
 listen to Barret some more, then head to the left.  In the next area,
 there is a Save Point in the upper-left corner of the screen, which
 you'll probably want to use.

 There is a guy north of the Save Point that you can talk to, if you
 want to get a nice view of the support pillar.  It's not required,
 though.  Continue to the left to reach the Sector 7 Slums.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (B)  Reactor No. 5
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - 1500 gil, All materia, Ether x3, Phoenix Down, Hi-Potion, Potion,
    Titan Bangle.

 Equipped on Tifa:
  - Leather Glove, Bronze Bangle.
  
 The first thing to do is talk to Barret.  He'll move aside, and you
 can then enter the building he's standing in front of, which is the
 called the "7th Heaven Bar."  Inside, Tifa chats with you, and you
 will have a chance to name her.  If you bought a flower from the
 flower girl, you can give it to Tifa or Marlene.  Now, if you try
 leaving the building, Barret will burst in.  After he's done and the
 other members leave, you can follow them by standing in front of the
 pinball game and pressing the Circle button, or you can talk to Tifa
 first, if you'd like.

 In the room below, approach Barret, and he'll begin talking.  Then,
 try to leave, and Tifa will show up.  Then leave and go back to the
 upper floor.  Tifa will show up and chat with you for a while, and
 a flashback scene will take place.  Afterwards, Barret shows up and
 pays you 1500 gil.

 The next morning, go up to the first floor and talk to Barret.  When
 he asks you about using Materia, you have the option of explaining
 to him how to use it or not.  If you don't know much about Materia,
 it might be a good idea to have Cloud teach him, so that you can
 pick up on the basics.  If you already know how to use Materia, then
 you can just skip the tutorial and get back to playing.  When you're
 done, leave the bar.

 You're now free to explore the Sector 7 Slums.  South from the bar is
 an Item Shop, and next to it is a Weapon Shop.  There's a boy on the
 first floor of the Weapon Shop who offers to let you use his bedroom
 if you pay him.  You can choose to give him 1 gil, 10 gil, or nothing
 at all.  He won't let you sleep there unless you pay 10 gil.

 On the second floor, there is an opening next to a ladder.  Go inside
 the opening first.  This is the Beginner's Hall, where you can learn
 about the basics of the game.  Immediately upon entering, you'll
 notice that there is a shiny blue ball lying on the floor to your
 right.  Go ahead and take it--it's an All materia.  When you take it,
 a chest will drop down out of the sky.  Open it to receive an Ether.
 There's also another Save Point here that you can use, if you like.

 If you go outside and go up the ladder, you will reach the boy's
 bedroom.  If you didn't already pay him, he shows up and insists
 that you pay 10 gil to stay the night.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Sector 7 Item Shop
    Potion                   50 gil     Item
    Phoenix Down            300 gil     Item
    Antidote                 80 gil     Item
    Fire                    600 gil     Materia
    Ice                     600 gil     Materia
    Lightning               600 gil     Materia
    Restore                 750 gil     Materia

 Sector 7 Weapon Shop
    Iron Bangle             160 gil     Armor
    Assault Gun             350 gil     Weapon (for Barret)
    Grenade                  80 gil     Item
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 Before leaving the town, I recommend that you pick up Iron Bangles
 for all of your team members.  Since it's pointless to earn AP when
 no Materia are equipped, you may want to buy some Materia to fill
 up some of the empty slots some of the characters have on their
 weapons and armor.

 Once you're ready to go, go to the exit at the north end of town and
 head to the west to return to the train station.  Now, if you really
 want to, you can keep going west to reach a section of the Train
 Graveyard.  There's not much to do here, but you can fight monsters
 just by wandering around, and if you want to earn some extra EXP, AP,
 or Gil this way, that's fine.  When you're ready to go, return to
 the train and get inside.
 
 Once you're on the train and can move around, go to the front of the
 train and Tifa will talk to you.  An alarm will go off, and you'll
 have 15 seconds to run to the front of the car.  If you go back and
 talk to the man on the right side of the train in the far back, he'll
 give you a Phoenix Down.

 On the second car, run to the front and talk to the man standing to
 your left.  He'll ask if you want something, so choose the top
 option, and he'll give you a Hi-Potion.

 On the third car, someone may run past you and steal 200 of your gil.
 If you want it back, just run back and talk to him.  However, this
 doesn't always happen.

 On the fourth car, the timer starts as soon as you enter.  Just run
 past everyone to the front of the car.

 On the fifth car, move Cloud to the front of the car.  It's hard to
 do this since your view is blocked.  Talk to Tifa, and when she moves
 to the train door, talk to her again.  In the end, the three of you
 will jump out of the train.

 You'll now be in a long tunnel.  Where you're at in the tunnel
 determines when you jumped off the train.  If you got caught early
 on, you'll be at the beginning of the tunnel, and will have to run
 forward for quite a while (the screen repeats about six times).  If
 you managed to get to the last train and jump off, then you'll be at
 the end of the tunnel and only need to go forward once to reach
 the next area.

 However, if you want to, you can run back down the tunnel to it's
 beginning, where two Shinra guards are hanging around.  If you
 approach them, you'll have to fight three Special Combatants.  In
 fact, you can fight them over and over, if you want.  This is an
 easy way to earn some EXP and AP, since you can kill the enemies in
 one round by pairing a Lightning Materia with All and then casting
 "Bolt" on all enemies at once when in battle.

 When you've had enough fun with them, go back through the tunnel
 until you reach a new area.  Here, there is a security sensor made
 of green bars of light.  If you look at the left wall, there is
 an opening.  Approach it, and Barret begins talking.  To go into
 the opening, either choose the first option twice, or the second
 option once.  Once you're inside, you'll find an Ether lying in
 the middle of the duct.  Continue past it and go down the ladder
 at the end of the duct.

 Now climb down the ladder and then go to the front end of the screen
 and climb down the next ladder.  In the next area, there are two
 ladders to take, but it's easiest to just take the ladder closest
 to you.  Climb up it, and you'll be in a duct.  Press up to crawl
 through it.  Outside, Jessie will be here.  Don't worry about the
 hatch to the south of her; this just leads back to the other ladder
 you didn't take in the previous area.  To the left of Jessie, almost
 hidden by the corner of the wall, is a Potion.  To the far left is
 another ladder; go down it to reach a walkway.
 
 At the end of the walkway is a bag containing a Tent, and next to it
 is a Save Point.  When you're ready to go, climb up the ladder in the
 lower-left corner of the screen and crawl through the next duct.

 You'll now be inside the Reactor No. 5, which looks a lot like the
 Reactor No. 1.  If you go to the right, there is a pipe you can
 slide down to reach the bottom floor.  Head to the south, then go
 west and enter the door (ignore the stairs for now).  Navigating
 through the rest of the reactor is easy, since it has the same
 layout as the first reactor...there's even a Save Point on the
 lowest level.  When you approach the area where you set a bomb in
 the last reactor, Cloud will have another flashback.  Afterwards,
 walk up to the reactor core and Cloud will fiddle with the machinery.

 Now you have to go back the way you came.  Remember the staircase
 you ignored earlier?  Go back to it and ascend both flights of
 stairs, then exit through the door on the left wall.  You'll be
 in an elevator which you can ride by pressing the switch.  Outside,
 there is a treasure chest to the north of you that contains an Ether.

 Continue north and go to the antichamber to the west.  There are
 three panels here that must all be pressed at the same time.  You
 can press them by using the Circle button, but time it so that
 Cloud presses his panel as Barret and Tifa do theirs.  Once you
 manage to do this, go up through the newly-opened door.  There's
 a savepoint in the righthand corner that you can us.  When you're
 done, head to the west and go north.

 You'll reach another T-shaped junction.  Here, you'll end up having
 to fight another boss, Air Buster.
 
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Air Buster
                LV: 15        XP:  180       Steal:  <nothing>
                HP: 1200      AP:  16        Morph:  <cannot>
                MP: 0         Gil: 150       Leaves: Titan Bangle
                Weakness:   Lightning
                Resists:    Fire
                No Effect:  Earth, Gravity
                Ability:    Program 1 Operation <doesn't hit>, Big
                            Bomber, Counter Attack, Rear Gun, Energy Ball
                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   No. 5 Reactor

 You have a big advantage against Air Buster, since he is caught between
 your group members.  Instead of attacking him from the front, have
 the characters who are behind him fight--they do more damage this way.
 Be warned, though; he can hit you from behind using his "Rear Gun"
 attack.  He has a "Big Bomber" attack that he uses against enemies
 who he is facing--this does a good deal of damage, so make sure that
 you keep your HPs at least above 100 points.  On the other hand, it
 will also fill your Limit meter very quickly.  The Air Buster also has
 an annoying "Counter Attack", where if you attack him, he turns around
 and slams into you.  There's no real way to see this coming, so just
 keep some Potions or Cure spells handy.  The Air Buster is weak against
 Lightning attacks, so even if he's facing you, you can still do a lot
 of damage with the "Bolt" spell.

 The easiest way to kill the boss is to have him damage someone enough
 until their Limit Break meter is full.  Then get him to face the
 other way, and use your Limit Break on his backside.  Cloud's "Braver"
 can do tons of damage this way.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 After destroying the boss, Barret asks you a question.  It doesn't
 matter how you answer, the end result is always the same...Cloud
 takes a dive :)


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (C)  Sector 5 Slums
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - 5 gil, Cover materia, Ether

 Equipped on Aeris:
  - Guard Stick, Bronze Bangle.

 After Cloud recovers, you'll find yourself in a church.  The flower
 girl is here, and after talking to her a couple of times, you'll have
 the chance to name her (again, I'll use the default name, which is
 "Aeris").

 After talking to her, a man shows up at the church entrance.  If you
 walk towards him, Aeris says, "Don't let it get to you."  Now go and
 talk to Aeris again, and she will ask you to escort her home.  The
 man turns out to be Reno, and he has brought a squad of Shinra
 soldiers with him.  In the next area, climb up the stairs.  When
 attempting to jump over a gap, Aeris will fall down to the lower level.

 You now have to help Aeris escape.  The easiest way to do this is to
 tell her to "Hold on a minute."  Run up the stairs to the upper level
 of the church.  There are several barrels here.  You can push them
 over to knock out the guards who are coming after Aeris.  However,
 if you push over the wrong barrel, Aeris ends up having to fight her
 way out.

 The correct order of barrels is as follows: the leftmost barrel (the
 one closest to you when you reach the top of the stairs, in the back),
 then the far right barrel (this is in the back), then the far right
 barrel (the one in the front).  Simply tell Aeris to hold on each time,
 then examine each barrel and choose the top option to knock it over.

 If you decide to have Aeris fight the guards, you'll have to use the
 "Change" option to put her in the first row at the start of each
 battle.  Otherwise, since she's attacking from the back row, she
 only does half damage and the battles take quite a while.

 Once Aeris is tagging along with you again, you'll go up to the
 church roof.  To your left is a fallen beam that you can walk up
 in order to get out onto the rooftop.  In the next area, keep
 pressing left to hop from roof to roof.  Once you finally get back
 on the ground, head northwest.  There is a Save Point here.
 Continue to the west, then in the next area, go north to reach the
 Sector 5 Slum.

 There's not much to see in the town, and that includes the weapon
 shop, since you can get better armor in just a short while.  If you
 have the money, I recommend picking up a Fire materia.  If you want
 to, you can also get another Restore or Lightning materia as well.

 However, make sure to stop by the house in the southeast corner of town.
 On the second floor, there is a flyer taped to the wall near the stairs.
 Be sure to read it--it's a Turtles' Paradise flyer.  Finding and reading
 all of them will net you a prize later on, so that's why it's important
 not to miss these (I'll point out the other flyers as they come up).

 There is a dresser near the stairs with two drawers in it.  However, if
 you talk to the sleeping child, he mutters something about a hidden
 drawer.  If you open this drawer, you'll find 5 gil.  However, if you
 choose to leave the gil there, you'll get a Turbo Ether later on.

 Now leave the house and go up a little and to the right.  You'll reach
 Aeris' house.  Before going inside, check out the garden area to the
 right of the house.  You can find a Cover materia in the lower-left
 corner of the flowerbeds, and an Ether in the lower-righthand corner.
 There's also a Save Point next to the house, if you need it.

 Go inside the house.  When you're able to control Cloud, go up the
 stairs.  After Cloud wakes up, go back into your room and check the bag
 by the front of the bed.  It contains a Potion and a Phoenix Down.  In
 order to leave the house, you have to get past Aeris without alerting
 her to your prescence.  To do this, walk over to the stairs, instead of
 running.  Also, keep Cloud in the middle of the hallway, so that he
 doesn't brush against the walls or the railing.  Once you've gone down
 the stairs, feel free to run out of the house. :)

 Leave the town and follow the path to the west.  You'll run into Aeris,
 who promptly joins you.  Getting through the next area can be tricky.
 Go up the pile of wood and run across the piece of metal with the holes
 in it.  Then go over to the red piece of metal and run down it to the
 ground level.  Go south through the hole, then run west and north to
 where a plank is.  Walk up it to reach the upper level.  From here, it's
 a simple matter of going down the other pile of wood and exiting to the
 north.

 (D)  Wall Market
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Ether, Phoenix Down x2, Hyper, Potion.

 In the next area, talk to Aeris when she moves away.  Once the two of
 you are done chatting, follow Aeris to the northeast.  Then go north
 to reach Wall Market.
 
 There's a lot to do here.  Don't forget the Weapon Shop, which has a lot
 of good items (be sure to buy some for Tifa, even though she's not in
 your party right now).  If you haven't already gotten a Fire Materia,
 be sure to pick one up.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
             
 Speaking of Tifa, you need to find out what happened to her.  Go to the
 southeast corner of Wall Market.  There is an exit here that leads to
 the Honeybee Inn.  Talk to the man standing in front of the Honeybee Inn
 (the one with silver hair and a red vest).  If you ask about Tifa, he
 tells you to go to Don Corneo's mansion.

 To get to the mansion, return to Wall Market and go all the way north,
 into the upper area of the town.  Keep going, and you'll see a
 building with red banners in the very back.  Go inside and talk to
 the man in front of the gate.  It seems that only women are allowed
 inside, and Aeris hatches a scheme to get Cloud in--by dressing him
 up as a woman.  She's serious, too, which means you better get to
 work.

 At this point in the game, you need to collect a certain number of
 items in order to pass off Cloud as a woman.  What's more, you can
 collect additional items to make Cloud seem more womanly.  How
 feminine Cloud manages to become alters some events later on.  You
 can do the following events in any order (although you can't get the
 wig until you get the dress).  Here's what you need to do:

  - Wall Market is divided into an upper and lower area, so keep that
    in mind as you read.  First, go to the clothing store, it's in the
    northwest corner of the lower area.  Talk to the lady there.  Then,
    go to the upper area and go into the bar (it's the first building
    on your left).  Talk to the man sitting near the door.  Now return
    to the clothing store and talk to the man.  How you answered his
    questions affects what kind of dress he gives you:

     - That feels clean + either answer  = Cotton Dress.
     - That feels soft  + shiny          = Satin Dress.
     - That feels soft  + that shimmers  = Silk Dress.
   
  - Now you need to get a wig.  Go back to the upper area and enter
    the first building on your right.  Talk to the woman and she will
    agree to give you a wig if you can beat one of her trainees in a
    squatting contest.  Choose "got it", then choose to begin the contest
    (although you can train if you want).  To squat, simply press the
    Square button, then the X button, then the Circle button, in that
    order.  Just keep repeating this until time runs out.  The type of
    wig you get depends on how many squats you did compared to your
    challenger:

     - If you did more squats, you get the Blonde Wig.
     - If you did an equal number of squats, you get the Dyed Wig.
     - If you did fewer squats, you get the Wig.

    In rating terms, the Wig is the worst, while the Blonde Wig is
    the best.

 At this point, you now have enough items to get into Don Corneo's
 mansion.  If you want to continue on with the game, go to the clothing
 store and get into your outfit, and skip down a ways.  If you want to
 collect more items for a better "feminine" rating, then keep reading.
                                     
  - Go to the lower area of Wall Market and go to the shop in the
    upper right-hand corner.  If you talk to the man there, he asks
    you to buy an item from the vending machine in the Inn.  Agree
    to help him, then go to the Inn.  It's in the southwest corner
    of town.  In the middle of the night, you'll have the chance to
    buy something from the machine.  Now go back to the shop and
    talk to the man.  He'll give you a reward based on what you
    bought.

     - If you bought the 200 gil item, you get the Diamond Tiara.
     - If you bought the 100 gil item, you get the Ruby Tiara.
     - If you bought the  50 gil item, you get the Glass Tiara.

    In rating terms, the Glass Tiara is the worst, while the Diamond
    Tiara is the best.
          
  - Go to the lower area of Wall Market and enter the building in
    the upper-middle of the screen.  It's a sushi bar.  If you walk
    past the empty seat, you'll have the option to sit down.  Order
    whatever you'd like (it all costs 70 gil), then pick the middle
    option.  You will receive a "Pharmacy Coupon."  Now go to the
    building beneath the sushi bar.  Here, you can exchange the Coupon
    for one of three items.  Once you've done that, go to the restaurant
    where you met the owner of the Clothing Shop.  Go to the restroom in
    the northwest corner and open the door, then talk to the woman in
    there.  Give her whatever medicine you bought, and she'll give you a
    reward in return.

     - If you gave her the Disinfectant, you'll get the Cologne.
     - If you gave her the Deoderant, you'll get the Flower Cologne.
     - If you gave her the Digestive, you'll get the Sexy Cologne.

    In rating terms, the Cologne is the worst, and the Sexy Cologne is
    the best.

  - Go back to the southeast corner of Wall Market, where the entrance
    to the Honeybee Inn is.  If you talk to the man who is milling
    about around here, he'll give you a "Member's Card."  If you talk
    to the man who is barring the entrance, he'll let you inside.

  - Now, go inside and talk to the lady in the middle of the room.  You
    can now go into the upper-left or lower-left doors.  If you go into
    the upper-left door, you'll see an image of Cloud in the left area
    of the room.  Talk to it, and Cloud passes out.  When he comes to,
    quickly talk to the Honeybee girl before she leaves, and she'll give
    you the Lingerie.
               
  - If you go into the lower-left door, you'll have to deal with Mukki
    and his pals.  Afterwards, he'll give you the Bikini briefs.

  - Afterward going into either door, you can go through the north door
    and talk to the lady on the far left to get some makeup put on you.
    After doing that, there's no other items to get here, so you might
    as well leave.

 Now, there's nothing left to do but return to the clothing store and put
 on the items that you've received.  Before you do so, though, you might
 want to take advantage of an easy way to learn your second Limit Breaks:

 Buy two Hypers and use them on both players to put them in the "Fury"
 status.  Then go back to Sector 6 and keep fighting until you encounter
 a Hell House.

 Fight it until it does the "Suicide Drop", revealing the monster inside
 the house.  Now you can simply stand around and wait for it to attack
 you.  Thanks to the "Fury" status, your Limit gauge will max out after
 only one or two hits.  You can keep your life up using "Cure" or other
 restorative items, as well as Aeris' "Healing Wind."

 Now, use your original Limit Break (Braver or Healing Wind), and let
 the Hell House fill up your Limit Break gauge again.  Don't forget
 to heal the Hell House after hitting it with "Braver"--you don't want
 to kill it, after all.  Even if you do end up killing the Hell House,
 you can just find another one and repeat this trick.

 After doing this for a while (8-10 uses should be all you need), beat
 the Hell House and see if you got your second Limit Break or not.  If
 you didn't, just repeat the trick.

 When you're ready to dress up Cloud, return to the clothing store and
 Cloud will put on whatever items you've collected for him so far.
 Then, go north to the upper area of Wall Market, and return to Don
 Corneo's mansion.  After you're let inside, go up the stairs and enter
 the door on the far left.  It leads to a torture chamber, where you can
 find an Ether lying in the left corner of the room.  After talking to
 Tifa and learning why she's here, you'll be told to go to Corneo's room.
 So, go up the stairs (Tifa and Aeris will automatically join when you
 try to leave), and go outside.  Enter the middle door.  If you walk up
 to Corneo, he will then pick which girl he wants as his bride.

 Who gets picked depends on how well Cloud is able to pass himself off
 as a woman.  If you picked up all the good items like the Diamond
 Tiara, Sexy Cologne, Blonde Wig, etc., then Cloud will be picked.
 If you ended up with lesser items (like the Dyed Wig), or if you
 didn't get any of the extra items, then Corneo will pick Tifa or Aeris.

 If Cloud isn't picked, then you'll be handed over to Corneo's henchmen.
 Once you're in their room, make your way to the east and grab the bag
 lying on the floor to get a Phoenix Down.  Now talk to Scotch, who is
 standing at the north end of the room.  Cloud will switch back into his
 normal clothes, and you'll have to fight the Don's men.  After beating
 them, you'll have to fight Scotch and two more of Don Corneo's lackeys.

 When they're dead, you can exit the room through the southwest exit.
 Outside, you'll run into Tifa.  Go into the middle door.  There's now
 an exit in the back of Corneo's room.  Go into it to find Corneo
 hanging out with either Tifa or Aeris.  Once you're in control of
 Cloud again, look behind his bed to find a Hyper.  When you try to
 leave the room, Don Corneo asks you a question.  No matter how you
 answer, you'll end up falling through a trapdoor.

 If Corneo did pick you, then you'll be taken straight to his room.
 Get the Hyper behind his bed, then continue on as you normally would.
 Don't worry about the Phoenix Down, you can pick it up later on.

 Anyway, once you fall through the trapdoor, you'll end up in a sewer.
 Before doing anything else, have Cloud go to the southeast.  There are
 some stairs here that lead up to a higher area.  At the far end of it
 is a Potion.  Go back and talk to your friends...once you've done so,
 a monster will show up.

 Aps' "Tsunami" attacks will damage all characters (including himself).
 However, the reverse version does more damage to you and less damage
 to him than the normal "Tsunami."   Since his attacks will fill up your
 Limit Breaks quickly, simply use Fire on him or attack normally until
 you have a chance to use your Limit Breaks.  With Aeris in your party,
 you can use her "Healing Wind" to easily restore lost life.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (E)  Train Graveyard
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Steal materia, Hi-Potion x3, Echo Screen, Potion x3, Ether x2.

 Items to steal:
  - Striking Staff (from Eligor)

 Go up the ladder that Aeris was lying in front of.  It leads to another
 ladder, so go down that.  To the south is a staircase leading up to
 another ledge, and lying on the ledge is a Steal materia.  Take it,
 then jump down the hole to the northeast.  In the next area, go down
 the stairs to the southeast, then go upstream and climb up the
 embankment where there is no railing.  You can then go over to the
 ladder and climb up.

 You're now in the Train Graveyard.  There are some enemies you'll
 definitely want to take advantage of, such as the rare enemy Eligor.
 You can steal the Striking Staff from him, which is a great weapon for
 Aeris to have.  You can also steal Ethers from the Deenglows (which have
 a resale value of 750 gil).  If you're willing to spend some time here,
 you can also win Graviballs from the Deenglows, which are very useful
 later on (hold onto them for now).

 Anyway, there is a Save Point here that you can use.  North of it is an
 entrance into one of the trains.  Go inside the train and head north,
 then exit out and check the nearby oil drum to find a Hi-Potion.  Go
 back and climb up the ladder next to the Save Point and run across the
 car to find a Hi-Potion.  Keep running onto the next car, then up onto
 the bridge-like iron girder that is hanging over two cars.  Go across it
 to the right.  Leap down onto the right-hand train car and run to the
 south.  There is a potion sitting in front of a light that you can take.
 Now go back to the girder and go to the left, down onto the ground
 floor.  Then go north and examine the oil drum to find an Echo Screen.

 Now go down and to the right.  You can now run south between the two
 trains.  The right-hand train has an entrance on the side, so go inside
 it and run south, then exit out the right side.  You should be near a
 ladder.  Climb up it, go north, then climb down the other ladder.  If
 you keep going north, you'll see an entrance on the side of the right-
 most train.  Enter it and go north.  Then exit out of the left side
 and grab the nearby Potion.  From here, you can go north to reach a new
 area.

 In this area, go north, then west and and south until you reach another
 Potion.  Go back to the north, then west, then south again, to where an
 oil drum is.  Look inside it for an Ether.  Now run back up and head
 north to where three golden trains are.  Enter the lower train.  It will
 move forward, dragging another train car with it.  Now enter the topmost
 train car.  It will move back until it touches a girder.  There is a
 train with a ladder between the two gold trains.  Run up the ladder,
 and get the Hi-Potion from the end of the train.  You can now go back
 and jump onto the uppermost gold train.  Run along it, across the
 girder, and across the other train.  Climb down the train, and you
 will have exited the Graveyard.
                                           
 If you head to the left, you'll return to the Sector 7 Slums.  A battle
 has broken out in front of the support pillar, however.  When you're
 able to control Cloud, you can make use of a Save Point just past the
 gate.  There's also a man in a red vest who will sell you items if you
 talk to him.

 When you're ready, climb up the staircase.  At the top, talk to Barret.
 When you get a message saying that you can go to your menu, that's your
 cue--don't press Circle to close the window, or you can't go to your
 menu.  Just press Triangle.  After you've set up your equipment and
 exited out, Reno will show up.

                Notes:      Summoned by Turks:Reno.

 Reno's attacks are fairly straightforward--except his Pyramid attack.
 When he uses this, one character is paralyzed and can take no action
 until the Pyramid is removed.  What's worse, if all three characters
 are trapped in pyramids, then the game is over.  However, a pyramid
 can be broken just by attacking it, and if you have the All materia
 attached to a attack magic, you can hit both the pyramid and Reno at
 the same time.  When you're not busy breaking Pyramids, just wail away
 at Reno with whatever you've got...he's not that hard, it just takes
 time to kill him.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 After the battle is over, talk to Tifa.  Once Barret is ready to leave,
 talk to him and the three of you will swing to safety.

 Items in this section:
  - Sense materia, Turbo Ether, Ether

 Once you're in control of Cloud, head south, as if you were going back
 to the Sector 5 Slum.  Your teammates will join you.  Now go back to
 the playground area.  There is a Sense materia lying near the gate.
 Your next goal is to go back to the Sector 5 Slum, but if you want to
 save your game before going there, you can always stop by Wall Market.

 When you're done, return to the Sector 5 Slum.  Remember that kid who
 had 5 gil in his dresser?  If you talk to him now, he'll give you a
 Turbo Ether. If you took the gil, then you don't get anything.  Now
 go to Aeris' house.  After Barret goes upstairs, you can go after him
 and talk to him, or you can just try to leave, and Barret will come
 back down and rejoin you.  Either way, once you've left Aeris' house,
 it's time to go to Wall Market.

 Once you reach the market, go back to the weapon shop in the upper
 area.  Talk to the man on the left, and he'll sell you a set of
 Batteries for 300 Gil.  Buy them, then leave.  If you go north, you'll
 see a bunch of kids running off to the east.  You can follow them, or
 you can return to Corneo's mansion in case you missed any items the
 last time around.  You can even free Kotch from the torture chamber,
 if you want :)

 Anyway, if you follow the kids east, you'll reach a wall with a wire
 hanging down the middle of it.  You can climb the wire up to a new
 area.  Here, jump off the wire and go left, down, then to the right
 until you reach a box-shaped opening.  You can put a Battery in here,
 and it will power a nearby propeller.  If you go to the north, you
 can hop up onto the propeller and use it to get onto a curvy piece
 of railroad.  There's another opening here, so put in another battery
 and climb up the bar that raises up.  Climb up the nearby wire until
 you reach the top; you'll now have to jump onto a swinging bar.  Just
 press the Circle button when the bar is coming towards you to grab it.
 If you have trouble with the timing, then wait until the "screech"
 sound ends (when the bar is closest towards you), then jump.

 After making it to the other side, climb up.  In the next area, there
 is a wire that you can climb down to reach another battery opening.
 Do so and put in a battery; you'll get an Ether in return.  Climb
 down and use the bar to jump across again, and go back up.  Continue
 working your way up and you'll eventually reach Shinra Headquarters.

 (G)  Inside Shinra HQ
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Elixir, Elemental materia, Star Pendant, Four Slot, All materia,
    Poison materia, Talisman, Enemy Skill materia, Potion x2,
    Mythril Armlet, Protect Vest, Guard Source, Star Pendant.

 Items to steal:
  - Carbon Bangle (from Moth Slasher), Hardedge (from SOLDIER:3rd)

 Equipped on Red XIII:
  - Mythril Clip, Mythril Armlet, Fire materia, All materia,
    Sense materia.
    
 Once you reach the HQ, there is a Save Point nearby that you'll
 probably want to use.  You have two options when it comes to getting
 into the building.  You can either sneak in quietly, or you can force
 your way in through the front doors.

 Sneaking in has it's advantages.  For one thing, you don't have to fight
 any enemies.  Just go to the opening on the left and follow it back to
 the staircase.  What's more, you can find an Elixir on one of the
 flights of stairs.  However, it takes a LONG time to climb up all the
 stairs, so you may just want to charge on in.

 Barging in gets you to the upper floors a lot faster, even though you
 have to fight quite a few enemies.  Upon entering, you'll be rushed by
 some guards. Afterwards, go to the back of the room.  You can chase the
 staff around the room, if you want :)  However, what you're really back
 here for is to check out the bulletin board to the right of the
 elevators.  One of the notes on the board is another Turtles' Paradise
 flyer.  You could take the nearby elevator, but instead go back and
 climb up either flight of stairs to the second floor.

 Here, you'll see that there is a shop in the northeast corner of the
 room (it's below the neon sign that reads "ACCESSORIES").  There are
 two chests in here, but you can't open them for the time being.  If
 you talk to the woman behind the counter, she'll sell you some items.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Shinra Building Item Shop
    Potion                   50 gil     Item
    Phoenix Down            300 gil     Item
    Antidote                 80 gil     Item
    Eye drop                 50 gil     Item
    Tent                    500 gil     Item
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 After talking to her, the other occupants of the shop will run out.
 This means that you can now watch the television in the left corner
 of the room to see a movie about an automobile manufactured by the
 Shinra.

 Now go back outside.  You could go up the stairs again, but there's
 nothing of interest aside from a little picture viewer that changes
 images every few seconds.  Whether you do or not, you eventually
 need to enter the elevator in the back of the room (you can do this
 on any floor).  Inside, go over to the control panel to the left of
 the door and press the circle button to start up the elevator.
 After a certain point, however, the elevator goes haywire.  To stop
 it, just go over and activate the control panel again.  Each time
 you stop the elevator, enemies rush in and attack.  There's also a
 random chance of a man trying to get on the elevator who freaks out
 when he sees it's occupants. :)

 Whether you came up the stairs or used the elevator, you'll eventually
 end up on the 59th floor.  If you approach the guards in the southeast
 corner of the room, they'll attack you.  After defeating them, you'll
 find a Keycard 60 on the ground.  There are some elevators here, so
 go into them and go up to the 60th floor.  While in the elevator, talk
 to Tifa and Barret to continue.

 On the 60th floor, move away from the elevators to get a better view
 of the room.  Go into the room on the left, and try to exit through
 the door.  Barret will tell you to go ahead.  What you have to do
 now is run between the gold statues without being seen by the guards.
 You can do this simply by standing under a statue.  Once you reach
 the middle area, use the Circle button to call your friends over.

 Getting past the first set of guards is not so hard, but the second
 set move around much faster.  Try to press the Circle button as the
 guards begin moving, so that your character finishes moving before
 the guards stop.  Once all characters are in the righthand room,
 you can go up the stairs to the 61st floor.

 On this floor, talk to all the people.  One of the men who is walking
 around will ask what you're doing in the building.  Reply, "......"
 and he will give you the "Keycard 62."  You can now use the elevator
 on the south wall to go up to the 62nd floor.  If you want to save
 your game, you can always go down to the 1st floor and use the Save
 Point outside the main building.  In fact, I recommend it, because
 a tricky puzzle is coming up on the next floor.

 On the 62nd floor, go into the room on far right.  In here is Domino,
 the mayor of Midgar.  He'll give you his keycard if you can guess
 what his password is.  If you need some advice, you can always talk
 to Hart, the man standing outside Domino's office.

 Figuring out Domino's riddle is a little tricky.  It basically works
 like this:

  - This floor is a library containing various books.  Each room
    contains a certain type of book.  You can tell what type of book
    it is by reading the panel outside each room.
  - For example, the "Urban Dev. Research Library" room contains
    info about the structure and layout of Midgar City.
  - However, there is one misfiled book in each room.  For example,
    you might find a book on weapon development in the "Scientific
    Research Library."
  - When you find a misfiled book, look at the book's title and the
    accompanying number.  Count forward that many numbers and then
    write down the corresponding letters.
  - For example, if the title of a book was:

           7 this document was written by chris macdonald

  - Then you would count forward 7 letters (ignoring spaces).  In
    this case, you'd end up on the letter "C" in "document."
  - Go through each room until you've found four misfiled books and
    figured out their letters.  For instance, let's say you end up
    with these four books:

          6  Reactor Construction Chart
          1  Biological characteristics of the Ancients
          1  Breakdown of SOLDIER members by class
         16  Modern history of Midgar space program vol. 1

  - The letters you end up with are O, B, B, M.  Now take those
    letters and try to rearrange them into a word.  In this case,
    a word you can make from the letters is "BOMB."
  - Now go back and talk to Domino.  He'll give you a list of words
    to choose from.  If your word is on the list, then choose it.
    If not, see if you can rearrange the letters into another word.
    If you can't, then you probably didn't figure out the right
    letter, or else you wrote down the wrong book name.
  - In our example, BOMB is indeed one of the words on Domino's list.
  - He'll now reward you with the "Keycard 65."  If you figure out
    his password on the first try, he'll also give you an Elemental
    materia.

 If you don't get it right on the first try, I recommend that you
 reset the game and try again, because a free Elemental materia is
 too good to pass up.  Remember, Domino's password changes each time
 you play.

 After getting the Keycard, go to floor 64.  The room in the lower left
 contains a Save Point, and you can sleep here for free.  When you're
 done, go into the large southern room where the exercise equipment is.
 In the upper-left corner is a vending machine that will sell you a
 drink for 250 gil.  Put in the money, and when nothing comes out, hit
 the machine.  Nothing will happen, but when you return here much later
 in the game, you will get the drink you paid for.

 Now go into the northern room, where the lockers are.  You can find
 a Phoenix Down in the third row of lockers, and an Ether in the
 second row.  When you're done, go down to the 63rd floor.  This floor
 is one giant puzzle that you can solve to get some free items.

 First off, go into the southeastern room and examine the computer
 terminal.  You will get a message about being able to open doors.
 Now exit the room and go to the northeast corner of the room.  If
 you walk to the east, you'll reach an area with a door to the west
 and a door to the south.  Open the western door and keep going
 forward until you reach another area with two doors; one to the
 west and one to the south.  Open the southern door.  From here, you
 should be able to go west and then south into the room on the far
 left.  In the room is an "A Coupon."

 Now go over to the air duct in the room and pick the top option to
 climb inside it.  Move south, then east, then north to another duct.
 Climb down it to reach another room where the "B Coupon" is.  Get it
 and exit through the south door, then go to the west and open the
 door to the west.  You can now go north into the last room to get the
 "C Coupon."  Go back into the room with the air duct, climb into the
 duct, and go south.  Then exit through the duct opening to the east.
 You'll be back in the room with the computer.  Access it and choose
 the bottom option ("Coupon Change").  You will then receive the Star
 Pendant, Four Slot, and All materia.

 If you messed up on the puzzle, you can always return to the computer
 and choose the first option to reset the doors.  Then, just re-collect
 the Coupons.

 Now, you may want to return to floor 64 and save your game.  This is
 a really good time to make use of that Steal materia of yours.  Use
 the stairs in the far right room to climb up to floor 68.  Here, run
 around in the little room you're in until you get into a fight.  If
 you fight Moth Slashers, you can steal Carbon Bangles from them.
 Since they are weak against Lightning, you can pair the Bolt and All
 materias together so that you can hit all of them.  If you really want
 to take the time (and it will take a while), you could always steal
 five Carbon Bangles, since they'll come in handy later on.

 If you fight SOLDIER:3rds, you can steal the Hardedge from them, which
 is a weapon for Cloud.  They can be tough, so I recommend killing off
 your enemies so that there is only one SOLDIER:3rd left.  That way,
 you don't have to worry about having your whole party put to sleep and
 being electrocuted to death :)  These guys are weak against Fire, so
 use that to get rid of them.

 If you encounter Warning Boards, just run away--they're a waste of time.
 If you lose too much life, you can always return to the 64th floor after
 the battle and heal up.

 Once you've stolen these items, it's time to get back to business.  Go
 up to floor 65.  In the middle of this room is a model of the city of
 Midgar, and in the smaller rooms are treasure chests.  What you have to
 do is open up a certain chest, get the "Midgar Parts" inside of it, and
 then use the parts on the broken sections of the model of Midgar City.
 Each time you do this, another chest will unlock.  You simply keep
 putting in parts until all the chests are open.  The chests can be
 opened in this order:

                1.  West room, lower chest
                2.  Southwest room, upper chest
                3.  Southwest room, lower chest
                4.  West room, upper chest
                5.  Northeast room, only chest
                6.  East room, only chest.

 Once you've put in all the Midgar Parts (except for the Sector 7 part
 of the model), the last chest will open up, which contains the Keycard
 66.  Now, you can go up to floor 66.

 On this floor, you'll see the Shinra executives gather in the center
 room.  Hmm...how to spy on them?  Go into the upper-left room (the
 bathroom), and enter the stall.  Walk south until the screen changes
 to an overhead view.  If you approach the toilet, you'll be given
 three options.  Pick the middle option to climb up into the ventilaton
 shaft.  Now hold down to crawl along the shaft.  You'll be able to
 listen in on the meeting in the main room.

 Now climb back down into the bathroom and leave.  If you try to go
 to the stairs on the right side of the room, you'll see Hojo leaving
 the floor.  Follow him up the stairs.  Since he unlocked the door,
 you can now access the 67th floor.  Follow Hojo to the left side of
 the floor.  After he leaves and you're in control of Cloud again,
 head behind the crates to get out of here (you can press Select to
 bring up the red exit arrow, if necessary).

 When the camera angle changes to an overhead view,  you'll see that
 there is a Save Point to the right, as well as a chest that contains
 the Poison materia.  Now, before continuing on, make sure one person
 has the Star Pendant equipped--you'll find out why this is important
 in just a moment.

 Now go into the elevator to the north.  You'll ride it up to the 68th
 floor.  After freeing Aeris, you'll have to pick someone to take her
 to somewhere safe.  If you pick the top option, Tifa will leave your
 party, while Barret will leave if you pick the bottom option.  Make
 sure that whoever has the Star Pendant stays behind.  Afterwards, you'll
 have a chance to name Red XIII.  Once you name him, you'll have to fight
 a boss.

                HP: 300       AP:  0         Morph:  <nothing>

                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Shinra Bldg. 68f. (part of HO512)

 You'll have to fight both the boss and three of the "opt" enemies.
 Don't bother killing them, as the boss can create more of them using
 "Reanimagic", and this will only serve to heal all of your enemies.
 Don't bother using "Bio" either, since the boss can absorb poison damage
 as HPs.  Instead, use "Fire" or "Ice" on HO512 ("Bolt" is not as
 effective).

 The boss' "Shady Breath" attack will poison the entire party, except
 for the wearer of the Star Pendant.  Using Antidotes on poisoned party
 members is a waste of time, since it uses "Shady Breath" often.

 When you kill the boss, all of the enemies will die.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 After the boss is over, you'll have to break your teammates into two
 separate teams.  To do this, press the X button.  You can't take Cloud
 out of your main party, however.  You can also access the Main Menu by
 pressing the Triangle button.  When you're done and want to continue on
 with the game, exit back to the game and press the Circle button.

 Once you're in control of Cloud, go back inside the tube where the
 boss was and pick up the Enemy Skill materia that he left behind.
 Now go across the walkway so that you're back in an overhead view of
 the floor.  If you go to the southeast, you'll find a raised platform
 with two Potions on it.  Now that you're on the upper level, you can go
 north to talk to the man who was operating the lift controls.  He'll
 give you the "Keycard 68."  Go back down to the lower level and go
 through the door on the east wall to find two more Potions.

 There's nothing else to do here, so go back to the elevator and go
 down to floor 67.  You can always save your game at the nearby Save
 Point before continuing.  Now go back to the right side of the building
 and go down the stairs to floor 66.  Enter the elevator, and you'll
 get caught by the Turks.

 Afterwards, you'll end up in jail.  You can talk to Tifa, or go up
 to your door to check up on any of the other characters.  After checking
 up on everyone, you can approach the door to be given an option to go
 to sleep.  When you wake up, the door will be unlocked.  Go outside and
 examine the guard, then go back in and talk to Tifa.  Then go and
 examine the guard again to get his key.  Now go into Barret's cell and
 talk to him.  Now go and talk to Tifa.

 You'll now be in a party with Tifa and Aeris.  Since you no longer have
 any keycards, you won't be able to go through most of the doors, so
 don't bother trying to go to a lower floor.  Instead, go to the
 southwest area of this floor to meet up with Red XIII.  Follow him up
 to the 68th floor.  Go through the door on the eastern wall and make
 your way northeast to where the stairs are.  Go up to the 69th floor.

 Here, exit the room and go west, out into the area with the twin
 stairwells.  There is a Save Point that you can use.  Go up either
 of the stairs to the 70th floor.  Here, if you approach President
 Shinra, you'll end up running into Palmer.  After he leaves, go
 through the northern door.  After meeting Rufus, the whole gang
 (sans Cloud) will go back down to floor 69.  You'll then be given
 the option to remove Cloud and Tifa's materia (top option), or
 not (bottom option).  I recommend removing the materia, since you'll
 have a chance to give it back to them later, and it makes giving
 them an optimal setup much easier.

 If you're wondering what the point of this is (since you can use the
 Exchange option to do exactly the same thing), well, there was no
 Exchange option in the Japanese version ;)

 Now, you'll be in control of Aeris.  Barret and Red XIII will have had
 their Materia unequipped, so put their Materia back on in whatever way
 you like.  I recommend giving a Magic materia (hopefully you have more
 than one Lightning materia, but Fire or Ice will do) to Aeris and Red
 XIII.  Feel free to use as many Materia as you like; don't worry about
 saving any for Cloud or Tifa.

 Also, since Aeris has such a low defense rating, you may want to put
 Barret or Red XIII first.  When you're ready, go to the east end of the
 floor and go through the south door, then go southwest to reach the
 elevator.  When you go inside and turn it on, you'll fight a boss.

 Hundred Gunner
                LV: 18        XP:  250       Steal:  <can't reach>
                HP: 1600      AP:  25        Morph:  <cannot>
                MP: 0         Gil: 200       Leaves: <nothing>
                No Effect:  Poison, Stop
                Resists:    Gravity
                Weakness:   Lightning
                Ability:    Aux Artillery, Hidden Artillery,
                            Main Artillery, Wave Artillery.
                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Elevator (after escaping from jail)
                Notes:      You can't tell what his individual XP, AP,
                            and Gil amounts are since it and the Heli
                            Gunner are fought during the same battle.
                            The figures listed are for both enemies.

 The biggest problem with this battle is that Aeris and Red XIII can't
 reach the boss, since they don't have a long-range weapon like Barret
 does.  However, you can always have them attack with Lightning while
 Barret does physical attacks.  Also, Red XIII's "Sled Fang" can still
 hit Hundred Gunner.

 As the battle progresses, the boss will change it's array of weapons
 and use different "Artillery" attacks.  Once it's life is low enough,
 the boss reaches it's final stage, and you'll get a message stating
 that it's "Sensor Cannon" is charging.  From that point onward, every
 time the Sensor Cannon is charged, it will use the "Wave Artillery,"
 which hits all members.  So, it's in your best interest to kill the
 boss as quickly as possible.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 After the Hundred Gunner is defeated, you'll have to fight another
 boss.
 
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Heli Gunner
                LV: 19        XP:  250       Steal:  <can't reach>
                HP: 1000      AP:  25        Morph:  <cannot>
                MP: 0         Gil: 200       Leaves: Mythril Armlet
                No Effect:  Poison, Earth, Stop
                Weakness:   Lightning, Wind
                Ability:    AB Cannon (can cause "Sleep"),
                            C Cannon (can cause "Poison")
                            Firing Line, Spinning Bodyblow, Flying Drill
                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Elevator (after escaping from jail)
                Notes:      You can't tell what his individual XP, AP,
                            and Gil amounts are since he only appears
                            after Hundred Gunner.  The figures listed
                            are for both enemies.

 Since your party has already taken some abuse from Hundred Gunner,
 this battle can be difficult.  The "Firing Line" attack can hit all
 of your allies, and it does a good amount of damage, so if you start
 this battle with low HP, try to fill it up as soon as possible.

 If you have the Cover materia equipped, it can cause some problems
 for you.  Since the only way to wake up a sleeping opponent is for
 them to take damage, you don't want to end up defending someone who
 was put to sleep via the AB Cannon, since you'll have to wait until
 they wake up on their own, which takes quite a while (unless, of
 course, you want to attack them yourself).

 After taking enough damage, the boss will start to spin and will start
 using the "Spinning Bodyblow" and "Flying Drill" attacks.  These only
 hit one person, but can inflict a lot of damage.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 After the boss dies, you will be in control of Cloud.  You can remove
 the Materia from other characters with the Square button, access the
 Main Menu with the Triangle button, or press the Start button to fight
 Rufus.  I recommend pressing the Square button to unequip everyone's
 materia so that you can give Cloud an optimal Materia setup.  I
 recommend at least giving him the Restore and Poison materias.  When
 you finish with that, press Start to fight Rufus.

 Rufus
                LV: 21        XP:  310       Steal:  <nothing>
                HP: 500       AP:  42        Morph:  <cannot>
                MP: 0         Gil: 650       Leaves: Protect Vest
                No Effect:  Gravity
                Ability:    Shotgun
                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Shinra Bldg. 70f.
                Notes:      You can't tell what his individual XP, AP,
                            and Gil amounts are since he only appears
                            with Dark Nation.  The figures listed are
                            for both enemies.

 Dark Nation
                LV: 18        XP:  310       Steal:  <nothing>
                HP: 140       AP:  42        Morph:  <cannot>
                MP: 80        Gil: 650       Leaves: Guard Source
                No Effect:  Confuse
                Ability:    Barrier, MBarrier, Bolt
                Manipulate: Bite
                Location:   Shinra Bldg. 70f.
                Notes:      You can't tell what his individual XP, AP,
                            and Gil amounts are since he only appears
                            with Rufus.  The figures listed are for both
                            enemies.

 The battle always begins with Dark Nation casting "Barrier" on Rufus.
 Ignore Rufus for now and concentrate on killing Dark Nation before it
 uses MBarrier on Rufus as well.  Once it's dead, use Magic materia
 (Bio works well) to damage Rufus, since the "Barrier" cast on him
 reduces the damage of your physical attacks.  Rufus' shotgun does a
 fair amount of damage, so keep Cloud's HPs up using the "Cure" spell
 or Hi-Potions (Rufus' Shotgun does more damage than a Potion, so
 don't bother using those).
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 After the battle ends, go back inside and go down to the 69th floor.
 Use the Save Point, if you want.  Tifa will be waiting for you, so talk
 to her.  The game then switches over to Aeris' party.  When you reach
 the ground floor of the building, head towards the exit.

 After Tifa shows up, you'll be able to play as Cloud riding on a
 motorcycle.  A screen will appear that explains the controls.  Use
 the X button to change your party lineup, or the Triangle button to
 go to the Main Menu.

 The first thing you want to do is decide who will be in your party.
 Then go to the Main Menu and pick the "Order" option.  Put everyone
 into the back row.  Be sure to give "Cure" + "All" to one character,
 and give "Lightning" to as many members as possible.

 When you're ready to start the bike sequence, press Start.  What
 you have to do is protect the car your friends are riding in. Use the
 control pad to move around, and the Square and Circle buttons to swing
 your sword to the left or right, respectively.

 After you reach the end of the road, you'll have to fight a boss.
 
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Motor Ball
                LV: 19        XP:  440       Steal:  <nothing>
                HP: 2600      AP:  45        Morph:  <cannot>
                MP: 120       Gil: 350       Leaves: Star Pendant
                No Effect:  Poison, Stop
                Resists:    Fire
                Weakness:   Lightning
                Ability:    [Ramming Attack] <hits all>, Arm Attack,
                            Twin Burner, Rolling Fire
                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Midgar Highway (outside Shinra HQ)

 As the battle starts, press L1+R1 briefly.  This will make your party
 face forward.  Why is this important?  Well, the boss gets to start
 off the battle with a free attack from the behind, and this way, your
 characters take less damage.  Furthermore, since you are getting
 attacked from the behind, your characters will all be in the back row.
 This is why I suggested putting them in the back row before the battle,
 since they'll end up being in front, where you want them to be.

 How much life your party has depends on how well you did during the
 car chase event.  If a character took a lot of damage back then, it
 will affect their starting HP levels now.

 At first glance, this boss may not seem all that difficult, but it
 has a nasty "Rolling Fire" attack which hits all members for a great
 deal of damage (250 HP or higher).  If more than one person has a
 Lightning Materia, you can make short work of the boss before it
 even uses this attack, but if not, you'll want to keep your HPs high,
 especially when the Motor Ball is in its' "robot" formation, as this
 is when it uses the Rolling Fire.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 After your party reaches the outskirts of Midgar, just try to run off
 the screen, and you'll get an option to stay (the top option) or leave
 (the bottom option).  If you choose to leave, you'll have to create a
 new party.  Once you've done that, you can leave and explore the
 outside world.  Note that who you put in your party affects your
 teammate's responses (such as taking all guys or all girls with you).


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (H)  Flashback
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items to steal:
  - Atomic Scissors (from Sweeper Custom).

 Enemy Skills in this section:
  - Matra Magic (from Sweeper Custom).

 Now you're out in the World Map.  You can use the L2 and R2 buttons
 to toggle between a forward or horizontal view, and you can hold down
 L1 or R1 to rotate your view to the left or right, respectively.  If
 you hold either button while walking, Cloud will move in a circle :)

 You also toggle the map using the Select button to make it appear in
 the corner, over the whole screen, or to make it disappear.  Also keep
 in mind that in the World Map, you can save your game whenever you want.

 Before you run off, you may want to run around on the barren patches
 of land until you encounter a Sweeper Custom (the mechanical enemy with
 a big body and little feet).  You can only find them in barren areas--
 not along the shore or where the ground is grassy, etc.

 If you encounter one, you can steal the Atomic Scissors for Barret
 (although this is close-range weapon, meaning that you'll need to put
 him in the front row to do full damage).  If you have the "Enemy Skill"
 materia equipped, you can also learn the skill "Matra Magic" from the
 Sweeper Customs.

 Now it's off to Kalm Town.  It's just northwest of Midgar, so it's not
 too hard to spot (I suggest using the "front" view so that you can see
 it from far away).  You might want to save your game before entering
 the town, a rather lengthy flashback scene is coming up ;)  You may
 think that you can just skip this event, but if you go ahead to the
 Mythril Mine, your party members will insist that you return to Kalm,
 so there's really no way around it.

 Inside the town, go into the Inn and go up the stairs.  The rest of
 the gang will be assembled here.  Once you approach them, Cloud will
 begin a drawn-out narrative of his past.

 Eventually, Cloud will get into a fight with a Dragon.  There's
 nothing to worry about, since this is just a chance to show off
 how insanely powerful Sephiroth is.  Once you arrive at Nibelheim
 and are playing as Cloud, run past Sephiroth and into town.  After
 Sephiroth goes into the inn, you can explore the area, if you want.
 If you go to the Main Menu, you'll see that Cloud has a different
 portrait, too (since the flashback takes place 5 years ago).

 You can also go into Tifa's house (it's the large building in the
 southeast corner of town) and look through her dresser, read a letter
 lying on her desk, or play on her piano.  If you choose to play her
 piano and pick the third option ("Just a little"), then Cloud will
 read the sheet music and play the following tune:

                "Do Re Mi Ti La Do Re Mi So Fa Do Re Do."

 That tune will be important later on.  If you want to try playing it for
 yourself, here's how.  This is the notation I'll be using:

        S = Square   T = Triangle    O = Circle      X = Cross

 You would then play the song by inputting the following commands:
                                     
                X, S, T, L1+T, L1+S, X, S, T, L1+X, O, X, S, X

 If you experiment with the buttons, you'll see that there are other
 ways of playing the same song.  This is just the method that I like
 to use.

 When you're done looking around, go to the Inn and go upstairs.
 Sephiroth is here, so talk to him.  Then talk to him again and
 choose the bottom option ("Yeah, let's get some sleep.")  In the
 morning, you'll meet the rest of the group near the outskirts of
 town.  Talk to Sephiroth, and Tifa will show up.  Now you'll skip
 ahead to the end of a bridge.  Sephiroth is now in your party (you
 can check out his stats if you want).  Anyway, run up the bridge,
 talk to Tifa, then continue up the bridge.

 Once you're in control of Cloud again, go northeast and go into the
 cave entrance.  Inside, go northeast again and exit through the hole
 in the north wall.

 When you arrive at the Nibelheim reactor, go up the stairs and go
 inside.  Once you're in, go north and then west along the beam to
 a chain hanging on the west wall.  You can climb down it by jumping
 from the plank sticking out to the west.  On the lower level, run
 east and go through the door near the gears.  Here, go up to where
 Sephiroth is and talk to him.  Do as he says and close the valve
 by the container on the left side of the lowest level.  Then look
 through the window of the pod by Sephiroth.

 Now the flashback will be interrupted, and you'll be given the option
 to take a break and save your game (pick the top choice), or continue
 on with the flashback (pick the bottom choice).

 When you're done, Cloud's narrative will continue.  Inside the Shinra
 mansion, go up both sets of stairs, and head east.  In the next area,
 go into the south room (where the guard is), and then east into the
 next room.  There is a curved section of the wall that you can push
 against to reveal a hidden passage.  At the bottom, go south in the
 cavernous area and then go east when the view changes.  You'll run into
 Sephiroth.  Go north and talk to him.  There's nothing else to do, so
 try to leave the mansion and you'll learn more about Sephiroth.

 The next morning, return to the underground library.  Go into the
 northern room and talk to Sephiroth.  Then exit the library after
 he leaves.  The town will be on fire.  Do as Zangan says and go
 into the nearby house.  Afterwards, you'll end up at the reactor
 again.  Go to the area where the pods were.  Help Tifa move out
 of the way, then go up the stairs and into the inner room.

 Okay, now the flashback is finally over.  Go to the ground floor of the
 inn and approach Aeris; she'll give you a PHS device.  It lets you trade
 members between your active and inactive party anytime you're on the
 World Map, or at a Save Point.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (I)  Mythril Mine
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Megalixir, Ether x3, Guard Source, Peacemaker, Choco/Mog materia,
    Tent, Long Range materia, Elixir, Hi-Potion.

 Items to steal:
  - Grand Glove (from Madouge).

 Enemy Skills in this section:
  - Level 4 Suicide (from Mu), Chocobuckle (from Chocobo),
    Beta (from Midgar Zolom), Flamethrower (from Ark Dragon).

 Now that the flashback is over, you'll probably want to look around
 Kalm Town.  If you go back to the second floor of the inn, you'll see
 a cabinet to the west of the stairs.  If you examine it, you'll see a
 green bottle that you can't reach.  However, if you examine the cabinet
 five times in all, Cloud will knock the bottle down, so that you can
 take it.  It turns out to be a Megalixir.

 If you go into the house to the northeast of the inn, you can find an
 Ether in the closet beneath the stairs.  In the house to the east of it,
 there is a locked chest on the second floor.  Even though this game is
 pretty old by now, people still haven't found a way to open the chest,
 and I've never figured out how to, either.  There are a lot of silly
 rumors about how to open it, but obviously none of them work.  It could
 be there just to pique your curiosity, who knows?

 Anyway, if you look in the dresser to the left of the two beds, you'll
 find another Ether.  In the house east of that one, you can find a
 Guard Source in a cabinet on the second floor.  If you go back down
 the stairs and go to the west end of the house, there is a spiral
 staircase that leads up to a room with a chest.  It contains the
 Peacemaker, a weapon that nobody can use right now.  If you want, you
 can also look through the window on the southeast wall for a view
 of the city.

 If you leave the house and go to the far east, there is another home
 you can go into.  If you open the door beneath the stairs, you can
 get another Ether.  Go outside and go up the stairs to reach a
 series of shops.

    Mythril Armlet          350 gil     Armor
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 If you stole items like the Striking Staff, Hardedge, Carbon Bangles,
 and Atomic Scissors in previous areas, then the Weapon Shop doesn't
 offer anything that you really need.  Don't bother getting the Mythril
 Claw for Tifa, as you can get a better weapon for her in just a bit.

 If you have the money, buying three Steal materias can be very useful,
 since you can attempt to steal items three times a round during battles.
 Since it's good to start building AP as soon as possible, pick up the
 Earth and Heal materia as well.  If you don't have a few spare Tents,
 you should buy a few of them as well.  However, you want to make sure
 you'll have at least 3500 gil in reserve, since you'll be putting that
 money to good use shortly.

 Now leave the town.  If you look to the southeast, you should see a
 valley that you can follow.  Since enemies often appear in groups on
 the World Map, you may want to give each party member an All materia
 linked to some kind of attack magic (Fire, Bio, etc.)  That way, you
 can dispose of multiple enemies quickly.

 Eventually, the valley opens up into a flat, grassy area with a farm
 sitting in the midst of a field, and a large marsh extending out to a
 range of mountains.  Go to the farm.  Walk up to the fence and use the
 Circle button to talk to the Chocobo.  If you choose the top option
 ("Wark"), then the Chocobos will dance for you.  When they finish,
 you'll get the Choco/Mog materia.  It's a good idea to keep this
 paired with the "Elemental" materia on someone's weapon.  That way,
 each attack will do double damage against an enemy who is weak
 against Wind.  And as it happens, most all bird-like and floating/
 flying creatures are weak against Wind (and you will encounter
 quite a few flying monsters in the areas to come).

 Now go past the fence and enter the house on the left.  Here, you
 can talk to Choco Bill to learn about Midgar Zolom.  You can also
 stay in his bedroom for 100 gil a night.  Sleeping there is also a
 cheap way to lift the "Sadness" status that Elfadunks can cause,
 instead of using up your Hypers.

 Exit the house and run east behind the Chocobo pen to the large barn.
 Inside, talk to Choco Billy and ask for a Chocobo.  Then choose the
 bottom option ("Not interested").  Billy will sell you a Chocobo Lure
 materia for 2000 gil.  He'll also sell you "Greens" which can be used
 as restorative items (or you can feed them to Chocobos).  You'll want
 to buy at least one Mimett Greens for now.

 Make sure that you don't sell or throw away your Chocobo Lure materia,
 as there are only two in the whole game.  If you lose both of them,
 then you're out of luck.

    Gysahl Greens           100 gil     Item
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
                 
 Leave the farm.  Before you go about catching Chocobos, you should save
 your game and get some Enemy Skills first.  Start by running around
 until you encounter Mus (the squirrel-like enemies).  If you get their
 life low enough, they may use their "Level 4 Suicide" Enemy Skill on
 you.

 Next, you need to equip the Chocobo Lure.  Run around in the light
 colored grassy area surrounding the farm, where the Chocobo tracks
 are.  Keep doing this until you get into a battle with a Chocobo
 whose level is a multiple of 4.  Instead of wasting time using "Sense"
 on your enemies, just look for a Chocobo who is accompanied by two
 Elfadunks or Levrikons.  That type of formation means that the Chocobo
 is Level 16.  So, use "Mimett Greens" on the Chocobo, then use your
 "L4 Suicide" ability.  The Chocobo will counter with the Enemy Skill
 "Chocobuckle."

 The final Enemy Skill you can learn in this area is from Midgar Zolom,
 a gigantic serpent whose shadow you can see circling about in the
 marsh near the Chocobo Farm.  Despite it's size, there are two very
 easy ways to kill it.  If you want to try fighting it, save your game
 first, then wade into the marsh, and it will track you down.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Midgar Zolom
                LV: 26        XP:  250       Steal:  <nothing>
                HP: 4000      AP:  25        Morph:  X-Potion
                MP: 348       Gil: 400       Leaves: <nothing>
                No Effect:  Paralysis, Stop
                Ability:    [Bite], [Tail Swipe], Beta
                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   In the swamp near the Chocobo Farm
                Notes:      A character hit from the Tail Swipe is
                            ejected from the battle and cannot rejoin
                            the party until the battle is over.

 The flat-out easiest way to beat Midgar Zolom is with Graviballs, which
 were dropped by the Deenglows in the Train Graveyard.  You can use them
 to knock Zolom down to half life or less in only one round.

 However, you still have to survive the "Beta" skill, which Zolom uses
 when it's life gets low.  To do this, pair the Elemental + Fire materia
 on someone's armor (preferably, the person with the highest HP).  This
 way, they will take only half damage from "Beta," which is a fire-based
 skill.

 If you don't have any Graviballs, then try this strategy; put all your
 characters in the back row, to raise their defense.  Then use the
 Tranquilizer item on each member to give them the "Sadness" status.
 This is important because you take half damage from physical attacks
 during "Sadness."  You definitely don't want anyone to have the "Fury"
 status, since they'll take double damage from physical attacks.

 Now, make sure the person with Fire + Elemental has no extra materia
 equipped aside from Enemy Skill.  This way, you'll have more HP.
 Give a Poison materia to your other characters (or, you can use
 Earth, although Poison is preferred).  Also give someone Restore + All
 or Restore.

 In battle, cast Bio, Earth, and Matra Magic (or Fire, if you don't have
 that Enemy Skill) repeatedly.  With any luck, Bio will also poison
 Midgar Zolom, draining a healthy chunk of it's life each round.  Since
 it's bite attack now does so little damage, the only thing you really
 have to worry about the monster rears up, since it can use his Tail
 Swipe to reduce your party to two people (or less) for the remainder of
 the battle.  Make sure the person with Fire + Elemental has maximum HP
 once Zolom has lost enough life, as it uses Beta when it's HP drops
 below a certain point.

 Once it casts Beta, use Phoenix Downs to revive your other members,
 and heal them as quickly as possible.  Then just continue casting
 attack spells until Midgar Zolom dies.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 For those who are wondering, "Midgar Zolom" is another mistranslation.
 It's supposed to be "Midgardswarm," a great serpent from Norse legend
 that circled the entire world of Midgard.  Just a bit of trivia for ya.

 If you don't want to fight Midgar Zolom right now, that's fine--you
 can always come back when you have better magic/equipment/etc. and get
 "Beta" then.  It's just that Beta is pretty handy to have.

 Now that you've got your Enemy Skills, it's time to continue on with
 the game.  You could use a Chocobo to get across the marsh (since
 they are faster and you have a better chance of staying ahead of
 Midgar Zolom).  Another, slower method, is to walk across the marsh
 and save your game whenever Midgar Zolom gets close.  Every time you
 load your save, Zolom's position resets, so you can keep walking and
 saving until you reach the Mythril Mine.  It's a lot faster with
 a Chocobo, though ;)

 To catch a Chocobo, go to an area with Chocobo tracks and run around
 until you get into a battle (actually, in this area, you can meet
 Chocobos anywhere on the bright green part of the field).  You won't
 meet them if your Chocobo Lure isn't equipped, though.  You then have
 to kill off the other enemies that accompany the Chocobo before it
 runs away.  Obviously, you don't want to hit the Chocobo, because it
 will run away as well.

 It's possible to catch a Chocobo without using Greens, but you have
 to kill off the other enemies very quickly.  It's far easier to just
 buy some Greens from Choco Billy (inexpensive ones will do), then
 use them on the Chocobo during battle.  Each time you use the Greens,
 the Chocobo will spend the round eating them, so you don't have to
 worry about him running away--at least until the next round.

 Once you have a Chocobo, you can run across the marsh.  Be careful
 to avoid Midgar Zolom, as you'll still have to fight it if it runs
 into you.  On the other side of the marsh is an entrance to the
 Mythril Mine.  When you arrive here, you'll come upon an impaled
 Midgar Zolom.  Just head south to leave the dead creature behind
 and return to the World Map, then enter the mine.

 Inside, go to the east.  In this area, you can get a Tent from the chest
 at the top of of the stone steps, and you can climb up a vine hanging
 from the west wall to reach a Long Range materia.  You can also learn
 the Enemy Skill "Flamethrower" from the Ark Dragons (flying yellow
 dragons) that are found in this area.  Strangely enough, they only seem
 to show up in the far eastern, far upper-eastern, or far western
 sections of the mine.

 Now return to the area where the entrance was and head south.  When the
 passage splits, go to the east to find a chest containing a Mind Source.
 Then take the other path that goes west, and follow it up into the next
 area.

 Here, you'll meet with the Turks.  After they leave, go north.  You'll
 find a chest containing an Elixir, and northeast of it is a Hi-Potion.
 To exit the mine, go back to where you met the Turks, then climb up
 the vine to the west and go through the opening to get outside.

 However, if you haven't stolen the "Grand Glove" from a Madouge yet
 (the enemy with a ball and chain), then hang around the mine long enough
 to do that before leaving.

 (J)  Fort Condor and Yuffie
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Magic Comb.

 Equipped on Yuffie:
  - 4-point Shuriken, Carbon Bangle, Throw materia.

 You're now in the Junon Area.  You should see a tower with a golden
 bird on top of it nearby.  This is Fort Condor.  Going here is totally
 optional, but if you want to mess around in there, here's what to do.

 If you approach the tower, you'll find a man standing around at the
 base.  Talk to him and choose the bottom option to get him out of the
 way.  You can now enter the tower.  Climb up to the first floor and talk
 to the man sitting at a table to the east.  Pick the first option (I
 guess so), then agree to help the man (the top option again).  Now that
 you've agreed to help, you can sleep in the basement room to the far
 east, and you can buy items from the shopkeepers on the upper level.

 Now go up to the top level of the tower, where a man is looking out of
 a window.  He'll tell you how the people of the Fort need to hire an
 army to stop the Shinra.  You can even help out by leading the army
 yourself.

 How to play "Fort Condor Battle"

 Basic Gameplay
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The "battle game" is a simple war simulation game.  The premise is
 pretty straightforward; you want to prevent the enemy from reaching
 the top of the fort where the shed is.  You can deploy soldiers and
 artillery to attack the oncoming enemy, and once you kill enough
 enemies, the enemy commander will appear.  Kill it to win the battle.

 The main problem with playing the "battle game" is that it costs some
 Gil each time you place a new ally on the battlefield.  If you win the
 war, you are reimbursed for each surviving ally, but not for those who
 died.  Therefore, if you're low on money, you have to work on placing
 allies effectively, instead of just throwing as many of them at the
 enemy as you can afford.  Not there's anything wrong with that type
 of strategy ;)


 Enemies and Allies
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Let's look at the enemy troops.  There are four types:

 Wyverns        These enemies move quickly.  Since they can fly,
                they cannot be hit by the "Stoner" or "Tristoner."
 Beasts         These enemies move slowly, but have a high attack power.
 Barbarians     Barbarians can attack enemies from afar.
 Commanders     The boss--has lots of life and a high attack power.

 Now let's look at the allied troops.  There are two types of troops;
 mobile and immobile.

 Allies (Mobile)

 Fighters     Your average ally.  Costs 400 gil.
 Attackers    They can move quickly, and are good against Beasts,
              but not Wyverns.  Costs 420 gil.
 Defenders    They have lots of life, but move slowly.  They are
              good against Barbarians, but not Wyverns.  Costs 440 gil.
 Shooters     Can attack from afar, but don't have much life.  They
              are good against Wyverns, but not Beasts.  Costs 520 gil.
 Repairers    Can repair/heal other allies, but have low attack power.
              Costs 480 gil.
 Workers      Can plant mines, but have low attack power.  Costs 400 gil.

 You'll notice that some allies are better suited to fighting certain
 types of enemies.  In battle, try to arrange it so that your ally
 fights only those enemies that it has an advantage against.
                         
 Allies (Immobile)

 Stoners      Can fire boulders, which can hit multiple enemies.
              Costs 480 gil.
 Catapults    Like the Stoners, but they can hit flying enemies, too.
              Costs 480 gil.

 There are also "Tri-Stoners" and "Fire Catapults", which are stronger
 versions of the above two allies.  However, you can't use them just
 yet.


 Basic Controls
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Before the war begins, you will have a chance to place your troops.
 To do this, press the Circle button to bring up your roster of allies.
 Pick an ally, then use the cursor to place them on the map.  You'll
 notice that some areas have an "X" over them; this means you can't
 place anyone there.  As your troops spread out over the map, you'll
 find that you can place them closer and closer to the enemy.
 Conversely, if the enemy has made a lot of headway, you'll have a
 reduced amount of space in which to place an ally.

 Placing immobile allies works a little differently, since after you
 place them, you have to select their "target area."  This is the
 area where they will drop or launch boulders at.

 After setting up your troops, press the X button.  Then pick the top
 option ("Yes") to begin the war.  Your troops will stay where you have
 placed them, and immobile allies will repeatedly drop or hurl boulders.

 You can take control of an ally by highlighting it with the cursor
 and pressing the Circle button.  Mobile allies can be asked to move,
 wait in place, or attack a nearby enemy.  Immobile allies can have
 their target area changed, or they can be removed from battle.

 If something important happens, a message will appear, such as "You
 have encountered an enemy," or "The target has been destroyed."  If
 you want to see what happened for yourself, press the Circle button.
 If you're busy with something else, press the X button to cancel
 the message.

 Finally, you can use the L1/L2 button to increase the speed of the war
 simulation, or the R1/R2 button to decrease it.  You can also press the
 Select button for a brief overview of the controls.


 If you win....
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 If you manage to destroy all the enemy troops, you will be reimbursed
 for any surviving allies.  What's more, you will recieve a prize.  What
 you get depends on how many battles you've won:

   1st battle won               Magic Comb
   2nd battle won               Peace Ring
   3rd battle won               Tincture        (actually 3 Ethers)
   4th battle won               Megalixir
   5th battle won               Super Ball      (actually Superball)
   6th battle won               3 Turbo Ethers
   7th battle won               <nothing>       (actually 5 X-Potions)
   Huge Materia battle won      <nothing>

 Here is a list of times when the Shinra will attack the fort.  As
 you can see, they seem to pick the most inopportune moments:

   1.  After getting through the Mythril Mines
   2.  The morning after defeating Bottomswell
   3.  ?
   4.  After getting the Buggy
   5.  ?
   6.  After getting the Tiny Bronco
   7.  ?
   8.  After completing the Temple of the Ancients
   9.  The very start of Disc 2 (backtrack to Bone Village and take
       the Tiny Bronco back to the fort).
  10.  ?
  11.  ?
  12.  ?
  13.  ?
  14.  ?
  15.  After getting the Highwind.
  16.  After finding Cloud at Mideel (Huge Materia battle).

 The prize you get depends on how many battles you've won, not which
 battle you fight.  So, if you don't bother fighting the Shinra until
 you've gotten the buggy, you'll still get the Magic Comb if you win,
 since it's the first battle you've actually won.

 I should mention that there is a far superior guide to the Fort
 Condor battles written by Lord_Epyon.  It's available at GameFAQs
 <http://www.gamefaqs.com>.  Check it out if you're looking for
 more detailed info.
         
 The Shinra will attack Fort Condor periodically, so it's a good idea
 to return there every so often.  I don't think it's possible to attend
 all the battles, though (for example, after you leave the Icicle Inn,
 the way back is blocked by Shinra guards.  Yet they get attacked five
 times before it's even possible for you to get back there).


 If the enemy wins....
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 If the enemy reaches the shed, you'll have to fight a "CMD. Grand Horn"
 enemy using your current party.  If you defeat it, then you will have
 won the war, but you recieve no prizes.  The enemy's level depends on
 how many battles you've won, not which battle you're on (see the info.
 on prizes above for more information).

 Furthermore, it seems as if the CMD. Grand Horn only goes up in level
 if you fought it previously.  In other words, if you fight the first
 war and win it (accquiring the Magic Comb), then lose during the second
 battle, you'll still fight a low-level CMD. Grand Horn since it's the
 first time you fought him.

 I know it sounds confusing, I have trouble understanding it myself :)
 If you can actually figure out how the level of the Grand Horn is
 determined, I'd love to hear from you.

 Anyway, if you lose the battle with CMD. Grand Horn, then the game
 continues on (the game doesn't actually end if you die, unlike most
 other battles).  I don't know what effects this has in the long run.


 Miscellaneous
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 You can also choose to donate money to the people of Fort Condor, and
 to let them handle the war instead of having you direct the troops
 personally.  I have no idea what the point of doing this is, as it
 only serves to waste your money and you get nothing in return.  If
 anyone knows the advantage to donating money or letting them handle
 the war themselves, I'd love to know.  I'd assume that without any
 financial support from you, the battles that you can't attend would
 be lost by the Fort inhabitants, but I don't really know.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
                     
 Once the battle is over, there's not a lot else to do at the Fort.
 However, if you return here periodically, you can fight more battles,
 and you will start earning rewards...just something to keep in mind.
 For now, though, you might as well leave.

 Before continuing on, though, it should be mentioned that the Mythril
 Mine / Junon Area is one of the few places in the game where you can
 earn a lot of AP easily.  Since you tend to meet enemies in groups (such
 as the Capparwires in the Junon Area or the Castanets in the mine), you
 can easily wipe them out by using attack spells + All.  This is also a
 good way to earn kills for your Limit Breaks, since one person can can
 kill 4-5 enemies at once using spells.  When you run low on HP or MP,
 you can go sleep at Fort Condor for free, then go right back to monster
 hunting.
  
 Anyway, while exploring the Junon Area, you may run into a certain enemy
 in the forests called "Mystery Ninja."  The ninja's real name is Yuffie,
 and you can get her to join you if you defeat her in battle.  Doing this
 is not too hard, because although her level goes up as yours does, she's
 still pretty weak.
 
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Mystery Ninja
                LV: ??        XP:  ???       Steal:  <nothing>
                HP: ???       AP:  ??        Morph:  <cannot>
                MP: ???       Gil: ???       Leaves: <nothing>
                Ability:    [Attack], [Fire Attack] (hits all),
                            [Dragon Scales] (hits all)
                            [Molotov] (hits all)
                            [Impaler] (causes "Frog"),
                            [Spider Web] (causes "Slow")
                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Junon Area / Gongaga Area / Nibelheim Area /
                            Rocket Launch Pad Area / Woodlands Area /
                            Mideel Area
                Notes:      Only found in forests.
                Notes:      Her level increases in accordance to
                            your party's levels.  This means that
                            her HP/MP/XP/AP/Gil amounts will vary.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 The only real reason to not get Yuffie at this point is because she
 becomes another factor in the "date" sequence that's coming up (refer
 to Terence Furguson's "Dating Guide" at www.GameFAQs.com for more
 information on this event).  You might be thinking that, since her
 level goes up as yours does, you could wait until you're at a high
 level (and therefore collect large amounts of XP/AP/Gil from her),
 but even by the time you reach Disc 3, she'll still be giving you
 low amounts of points for being killed (I found this out the hard
 way).
 
 If you don't want to get Yuffie right now, don't worry about having to
 come all the way back to Junon.  You can find her in the forests of
 the Gongaga, Nibel, Rocket Launch Pad, and Woodlands areas as well.

 Anyway, when you defeat her, the scene will switch to a grassy plain
 containing a Save Point.  There are a number of ways in which Yuffie can
 escape and steal a variable amount of your gil in the process.  One of
 those ways is to attempt to use the Save Point (simply stepping on it
 and going to the Main Menu is enough).  Another way is to pick the wrong
 reply when talking to her.

 So, to get Yuffie in your party, start by going up and talking to her.
 As you chat, choose the following replies:

 If Cloud is leading the party:

                - 2nd choice ("Not interested")

                (Go up and talk to her again)

                - 1st choice ("......petrified")
                - 2nd choice ("Wait a second!")
                - 2nd choice ("......That's right")
                - 2nd choice ("......Let's hurry on")

 If Tifa is leading the party:

                - 2nd choice ("Don't fight")

                (Go up and talk to her again)

                - 1st choice ("......petrified")
                - 2nd choice ("Wait a second!")
                - 2nd choice ("......That's right")
                - 2nd choice ("Come on, let's hurry")

 If Cid is leading the party:

                - 2nd choice ("Forget it!")

                (Go up and talk to her again)

                - 1st choice ("Something like that")
                - 2nd choice ("......Hold on!")
                - 2nd choice ("......That's right")
                - 2nd choice ("Come on, or we'll leave you!")

 Now Yuffie will become a selectable character.  You can use the PHS
 device (go to your Main Menu to use it) to swap her with a current
 member of your party, if you wish.  Since all of Yuffie's weapons
 are long-ranged, she can attack from the back row with no penalties.
 What's more, she also comes equipped with a Throw materia, which you
 cannot normally obtain until much later in the game.

 Whether or not you get Yuffie to join you, you can always steal a
 Boomerang for her from the Formula enemies found in the Junon Area
 (they're pink birds that hang in mid-air).  However, you'll be getting
 a better item for her shortly, so it doesn't really matter.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (K)  Junon Town
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Power Wrist, Shiva materia, Enemy Skill materia, 1/35 soldier x2,
    Mind Source, Luck Source, Power Source, Guard Source, Speed Source.

 You can also earn one prize from each list:
  - Grenade, Potion x6, Ether x6, 5000 gil.
  - Silver Glasses, HP Plus materia, Force Stealer.

 Your next goal is to get to the city of Junon, which lies on the coast
 northwest of Fort Condor (you can press Select repeatedly to enlarge
 the map and get a better idea of where you need to go).  You'll know
 when you see it, since it's built into the side of a cliff and has a
 large cannon protruding from it out into the ocean.

 When you enter Junon, you'll actually arrive at a town built underneath
 it.  There's not much here to see aside from a weapon shop.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Under Junon Weapon Shop
    Mythril Armlet          300 gil     Armor
    Potion                   50 gil     Item

    Tent                    500 gil     Item
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 When you're done looking around town, head southwest.  There are a set
 of stairs behind the house near the town entrance.  Go down them to
 reach the shore.  Here, you'll have to fight a boss, Bottomswell.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Bottomswell
                LV: 23        XP:  550       Steal:  <nothing>
                HP: 2500      AP:  52        Morph:  <cannot>

                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Dolphin Offing (under Junon)

 Waterpolo  
                LV: 4         XP:  0         Steal:  <nothing>
                HP: 40        AP:  0         Morph:  <cannot>
                MP: 0         Gil: 0         Leaves: <nothing>
                No Effect:  Physical attacks, Poison, Sleep, Paralysis,
                            Darkness, Regen, Berserk, Invincibility
                Ability:    None.
                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Dolphin Offing (under Junon)
                Notes:      Created by Bottomswell.

 If you have the enemy skill "Beta", then you can kill Bottomswell
 in no time flat, since it will do around 800-1000 points of damage
 per use.  Otherwise, things get a little tricky.

 The trouble with fighting Bottomswell is that it is a flying enemy, so
 your attacks won't reach it.  One way around this is to give someone
 the Long Range materia, since it not only lets you attack from the
 back row with no penalties, but it lets you hit enemies that are
 beyond your reach.  I suggest that whoever has the Long Range materia
 also has Elemental paired with Choco/Mog on their weapon.  Since
 Choco/Mog does Wind damage and Bottomswell is weak against wind, that
 person's attacks will inflict double damage.

 Even if your other characters have long-range weapons (like Yuffie's
 4-point Shuriken), you're better off using magic.  If you've managed
 to learn Bolt2, Ice2, etc., you can make short work of the boss.
 Otherwise, I recommend using "Bio" or the "Flamethrower" enemy skill
 ("Bio" is preferred, since it can also poison it's target).

 Bottomswell's method of attack depends on it's "flight pattern."  At
 first, it will only use physical attacks and it's Tail Attack.  Once
 it changes it's pattern, it will start using Moonstrike repeatedly.
 After changing it's pattern again, it will begin using it's "Waterpolo"
 and "Big Wave" attacks.

 The "Waterpolo" attack will create a bubble around one of your party
 members.  Whoever is trapped inside the bubble will lose HP at a rapid
 rate and can take no action until the bubble is destroyed.  However, the
 only way to do this is with magic, since Waterpolo takes no damage from
 physical attacks.  Just make sure that you specifically target the
 Waterpolo and not the trapped character ;)  If you have an attack magic
 paired with All, then you can hit the boss and Waterpolo at the same
 time (or you can do this using Matra Magic or Beta).

 As for the "Big Wave" attack, this can hit all members.  It doesn't do
 much damage, but he will always use this just before dying, so be sure
 that your HPs aren't too low before you deliver the killing blow.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 After the boss is destroyed, you have to resuscitate Priscilla via CPR.
 To do this, simply press the Square button, wait until the red marker
 is at the highest part of the "lung meter", then press Square.  An easy
 way to determine this is to just count up each time the meter rises,
 until it's risen ten times.  You can revive the girl in about five deep
 breaths.  There's no way for you to fail at this event, you just have to
 keep doing it until she revives.

 Back in Junon, go to the house near the entrance and talk to the old
 lady standing out front.  She'll let you stay the night at her house.
 Since there's nothing else to do, you might as well stay (pick the
 bottom option).  If you want to do something else and sleep later,
 just return to the house and pick the top option to go to sleep.

 The next morning, you can always leave the town and go back to Fort
 Condor for another war scenario.  Yes, this means you have to go back
 with only Cloud in your party ;)

 Then, go back to Junon and go to Priscilla's house (it's the one with
 the staircase in front of it).  She will give you the "Shiva" materia.
 Now go back down to the beach and talk to the girl again.  She'll tell
 you how to use her pet dolphin to reach a tower that's out in the middle
 of the water.  Pick the middle option ("Sure"), to regain control of
 Cloud.

 The risky part of getting onto the tower is that you will get fried
 if you touch the electricity coming off of the tower.  However,
 there is a ridiculously easy way to land on the tower perfectly.
 From where you are, don't move, and press the Square button.  The
 dolphin will deposit you near the bttom of the screen.  Now press
 the Square button again, and you will land on top of a beam sticking
 out of the tower.  Now just head to the west and climb up the tower.

 When you're in control of Cloud again, run south (towards the screen)
 until the perspective changes.  Now go over to the large platform
 sticking out of the ground and approach the yellow dais near the
 southeast end of the platform.  Press the Circle button to make the
 platform descend.  To exit this area, go south to where there is
 an overhanging section of roof and run underneath it.

 Inside, a Shinra officer will mistake you for a new recruit.  Do as
 he says and go into the room to the northwest.  Go to the locker
 in the southwest corner and choose the second option to change into
 a Shinra uniform.  Once you've changed, the officer and some fellow
 soldiers will show you how to salute.  Once they leave, you may
 want to go to the south first, to find a Save Point.  This way, if
 you mess up in the parade, you can just do a soft reset and try
 again.  Now go through the exit to the west to go outside.  Follow
 your teammates over to the alley, then talk to the commander.  The
 other soldiers will run into the alley, so follow after them.

 In this next scene, you have to sneak your way into the ranks of the
 parade.  How well you pull this off will affect the "ratings" meter
 shown at the bottom of the screen.  To do this, wait until the commander
 tells you to go, then run to the left behind the other troops.  Walk
 south and then north so that you're in step with the two soldiers in the
 last row (be sure to let go of the X button so that you'll march with
 them instead of running).  Now just press the Circle button in time with
 them to move your gun.

 Depending on how well you managed to march, you will be given a reward
 (ratings provided by Ignacio DeLucas):

                01% - 21%               Grenade
                22% - 39%               Potion x6
                40% - 50%               Ether x6
                51% - 99%               5000 gil

 In the next area, you're ordered to stand still while Rufus is talking
 to Heidegger.  Of course, you can use the control pad to move around and
 irritate the hell out of the commander :)  After the soldiers leave, you
 can answer the commander any way you like, he'll still stick you with
 more guard duty.  After he and his men show you how to do the sendoff
 ceremony, you'll be free to explore the city.

 Start by saving your game again, since there's another chance coming
 up to earn some good items, and you'll want to be able to reset and try
 again if you mess up.

 There are about a billion shops in the city, so hopefully you've got
 some Gil saved up.  The shops are listed in order going from east to
 west.  Some of them are hard to find--you can always press the Select
 button to see all of the possible exits in an area.

 If you've taken the time to steal weapons from your enemies in previous
 areas, you'll see that the items you've been using for the last couple
 of hours only become available for purchase now.  Aren't you glad you
 took the time to rob your opponents blind? ;)

 Be sure to go into the third door from the right (the one with a "27"
 written on the nearby wall).  If you go into the room and talk to the
 soldier standing to the east, he'll move out of the way, and you can
 go into the "Respectable Inn."  There is another "Enemy Skill" materia
 in the southeast corner of the Inn, and you can talk to the people
 there to learn about the gameplay basics (yes, the flickering people
 are the ghosts of the people from Sector 7).

 Then, go back out into the main room and go up the stairs.  On the 2nd
 floor, you can find a "1/35 soldier", "Mind Source", and "Luck Source"
 in the two rooms on this floor.  On the top floor, you can find both
 a "Power Source" and a "Guard Source" that are just lying around.

 If you keep heading west along the main road, you'll reach the lift
 that Rufus and Heidegger took.  Past it is a tunnel, and then there
 is another lift.  Beyond it is the other half of the city.

 If you go into the second door from the right (the one with a "59"
 painted nearby the entrance), you'll find yourself at an inn.  You
 can spend the night here, and there is a Save Point.  On the second
 floor is another Materia shop, and above it is an Accessory shop.

 Go into the entrance to the west of the inn.  There's a little bug in
 this section--you can talk to any part of the north wall to converse
 with the guard.  You can also find a "Speed Source" in the alcove south
 of the bunks.  On the top floor, you can find another "1/35 soldier."

 Finally, the last entrance leads to a weapon shop.

 In the next area, you'll have to give Rufus a sendoff ceremony.  It's
 pretty straightforward--just press the buttons in the proper sequence.
 Since the order changes every time you play, I can't help you with this;
 you'll just have to practice.  Cloud will get a reward depending on how
 high the president's "mood gauge" gets while Cloud is performing:

         000 - 050 points               Silver Glasses
         060 - 090 points               HP Plus materia
         100 - 200 points               Force Stealer

 You'll have to decide which one you want more, the HP Plus materia or
 the Force Stealer.  You can buy the Force Stealer in just a little
 while (and for only 2200 gil), while the opportunity to buy an HP Plus
 materia doesn't come up for a long time (and they're 8000 gil a piece).
 I'd go for the HP Plus materia, myself.  Remember, you earn 10 points
 for each successful move and 30 points for the finishing pose.

 After the sendoff, you can use the controller and buttons to make Cloud
 act goofy while the others are talking :)  Once the other men leave,
 you can run onto the ship before it leaves.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (L)  Cargo Ship
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - All materia, Wind Slash, White Cape, Ifrit materia.

 Items to steal:
  - Shinra Beta (from Marine)

 You'll start off in the hull of the cargo ship.  To the southwest is
 a chest containing an Ether, and to the northwest is an All materia.
 However, if you got Yuffie to join your party, she'll be in the way
 of the materia.  Don't worry, you can get it later.

 What you need to do now is talk to all of your teammates (you don't
 have to talk to Yuffie, though).  However, they are disguised as Shinra
 soldiers, so you'll have to talk to them to find out who is on your side
 and who is just a soldier.  Some, like Red XIII, are painfully obvious.
 After talking to Aeris, take the stairs up to the top deck.

 Here, there is an officer you can talk to.  If you pick the second
 option ("Something's missing") he'll sell you some items.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Cargo Boat Item Shop
    Potion                   50 gil     Item
    Phoenix Down            300 gil     Item
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 If you pick the first option ("I'm tired...") then he will sell you
 a drink for 250 gil that refills your HP and MP to max (it's supposed
 to be "Invincible Alpha", by the way, not "Invisible Alpha.")

 Once you've talked to all of your teammates up here (exluding Barret),
 go back down and talk to Aeris again.  She'll ask where Barret has
 gotten to.  If you go back up to the deck and go to the southwest area
 (near the ladder that leads to the Save Point), you'll see that the
 soldier who was here has left, which means you can head west to reach
 the front end of the boat.  Here, talk to Barret twice.  Now return to
 the main deck.  After your party decides to go snooping around, you'll
 get to assemble a party.

 Once you've done that, go back down to the hull.  If you couldn't get
 the All materia earlier, now's the time to grab it.  You can also
 steal the "Shinra Beta" bracelet from the Marine enemies (they look
 like common soldiers).
                         
 Since the ship's crew is dead, you can go through the door on the north
 wall to reach the engine room.  Here, go up the ladder to your left and
 follow the walkway until you reach a chest containing the Wind Slash,
 a weapon for Yuffie.

 Now, go back down and approach the commander standing near the engine.
 You will then have to fight a boss.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Jenova*BIRTH
                LV: 25        XP:  680       Steal:  <nothing>
                HP: 4000      AP:  64        Morph:  <cannot>
                MP: 110       Gil: 800       Leaves: White Cape
                No Effect:  *Gravity, Poison, Sleep, Paralysis, Stop*
                Ability:    [Laser], Stop, W-Laser, Tail Laser <hits all>
                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Cargo Ship

 If you have "Beta", you can do around 900+ damage on her each round, but
 if not, hopefully you've learned second-level attack spells by now (like
 Fire2 or Bolt2).  If you have, you can kill her in just a few rounds.

 Unfortunately, Jenova doesn't have any real weaknesses, so if you don't
 have any of the above abilities, you might as well just use your Summon
 materia on her and then rely on physical attacks for the remainder of
 the battle, using your Limit Breaks whenever possible.  Jenova can do
 a lot of damage with her W-Laser and Tail Laser attacks, so don't let
 anyone's HP get too low.  There's not much you can do about her "Stop"
 attack, but the affected character will eventually snap out of it, so
 don't worry.

 Aeris is a good character to have for this battle (especially if your
 levels are low), since you can use "Healing Wind" often, due to the
 high amount of damage Jenova's laser attacks inflict.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 
 After the battle is over, be sure to pick up the Ifrit materia before
 leaving the boat.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (M)  Mt. Corel
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Fire Ring, Power Source, Motor Drive, Wizard Staff, W Machine Gun,
    Star Pendant, Turbo Ether, Transform materia, Phoenix Down x10,
    Mind Source, Power Source, Tent.

 Items to steal:
  - Diamond Pin (from Bagnadrana)

 After you leave the harbor, Rufus and Heidegger will show up.  Once
 Rufus leaves, you'll be in control of Cloud.  If you go through the door
 at the east end of the bridge, you'll find yourself in the Shinra Villa.
 There is a man here who will sell you the villa for 300,000 gil, which
 of course you don't have at such an early point in the game.  However,
 once you do get enough money, you can always come back here and buy the
 villa.
 
 If you head to the back of the villa and go down the stairs, you'll find
 a basement containing several items.  There is a chest near the stairs
 containing a Fire Ring, and a Power Source can be found in the southeast
 corner of the room.  Nearly obscured by the room's light source is a bag
 containing the Motor Drive (a weapon for Tifa).  If you look carefully,
 you can see it lying near the pile of crates to the left of the stairs.

 If you go down the stairs and to the east, you'll find an entrance
 to a bar.  There is a man hanging around in the southwest corner of
 the bar who will sell you items.
 
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Costa del Sol Weapon Shop
    Platinum Bangle        1800 gil     Armor
    Carbon Bangle           800 gil     Armor
    Four Slots             1300 gil     Armor
    Molotov                 400 gil     Item
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 I suggest you pass on the Platinum Bangle, because although it has a
 double growth rate, you can only hold two materia in it, and it has a
 really poor defense rating.
 
 Outside of the bar and to the east are two kids playing with a ball.  If
 you look to the left of them, you'll see an entrance in the side of the
 wall (use the Select button if you can't see it).  In here is Johnny,
 Tifa's old flame, who you may have met briefly back in Sector 7.

 If you go back outside and talk to the man to the right of the yellow
 truck (he's standing behind a counter), he will sell you some items.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Costa del Sol Materia Shop
    Heal                   1500 gil     Magic materia
    Revive                 3000 gil     Magic materia
    Restore                 750 gil     Magic materia

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 To the east of him is an Inn where you can stay for 200 gil a night.
 East of the inn is a man standing under an orange awning who will also
 sell you stuff.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Costa del Sol Item Shop
    Potion                   50 gil     Item
    Hi-Potion               300 gil     Item
    Phoenix Down            300 gil     Item
    Soft                    150 gil     Item
    Antidote                 80 gil     Item
    Eye drop                 50 gil     Item
    Hyper                   100 gil     Item
    Tranquilizer            100 gil     Item
    Tent                    500 gil     Item
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 If you go down the steps near the inn, you'll arrive at the beach.  If
 you spent the night in the Inn before coming here, there will be no one
 of importance here.  However, if you've just arrived and you go to the
 beach, you'll run into Hojo.  After talking to him, your friends will
 split up, and you can find them at various places in the town, depending
 on who is in your current party at the time.  You can find Aeris and
 Barret in the Inn, while Yuffie will be working part time for Butch
 (the man who sells materia to the west of the Inn).  Tifa can be found
 in Johnny's house, while Red XIII will be playing ball with the kids
 outside.

 When you're ready to go, leave Costa del Sol.  If you head down the
 peninsula towards the mountains, you'll see a mountain path that you
 can follow.  Eventually, it leads to an opening in the side of a
 mountain, Mt. Corel.

 When you reach Mt. Corel, start climbing up.  There is a man here who
 you can talk to.  Past him, you can walk forward into the sunlight to
 reach the next area.  Here, just keep climbing up, and follow the
 path as it turns northwest.

 You'll end up at the Corel reactor.  There's not much to do here for
 the time being, so make your way south.  In the next area, just run
 along the tracks--there's nothing of interest here.

 Now you'll arrive at a curving section of railroad.  There's a Save
 Point here that you can use.  Take the upper route--soon a piece of
 the track will give way, and you'll be instructed to press the Circle
 button to jump.  However, don't do a thing and let Cloud fall.  Now,
 by holding left or right while rapidly tapping the Circle button,
 you can make Cloud fall to the left or right.  If you fall to the
 left, you will find a Wizard Staff while climbing back up to the
 tracks, and if you fall to the left, you will find a Star Pendant.

 Back atop the track, keep following the upper path until you reach a
 chest.  Inside it is a W Machine Gun.  Now go back and take the
 lower path.  When instructed to jump, let yourself fall, and move
 Cloud in the opposite direction to pick up whichever treasure you
 missed last time.  Continue on until you have a chance to take the
 top path, and run west along it to pick up a Turbo Ether.  There is
 another weak piece of track here, but if you already got both items,
 you might as well just press the Circle button to jump.  Just past
 it is the Transform materia.

 Head back east along the track, and take the upper route.  In the
 next area, you'll see that a bridge on the lower path has been raised.
 To lower it, follow the track until you come across a small shack.
 Go inside it and choose the top option to lower the bridge.

 Just past the shack, where the track curves, you can climb up the side
 of the mountain wall.  Up here, you'll find a nest with some baby chicks
 in it, as well as some treasure.  You can pick the bottom option to
 leave the treasure where it is, or the top option to try and take it.
 In order to this, though, you have to fight a single Cokatolis.  Once
 it's defeated, you'll get 10 Phoenix Downs. Keep in mind, though, if you
 choose not to take the treasure, you can't go back and get it later on.

 Since the upper track ends in a dead end, you have no choice but to go
 back the way you came and take the lower path.  Follow it across the
 bridge until the track splits, and then follow the western path as it
 curves back in on itself.  If you follow it north, the path will then
 curve eastward, and you'll find yourself inside a cave.  Here, you can
 find a Mind Source, a Power Source, and a chest containing a Tent.

 Now go back to where the track split.  If you haven't yet encountered
 a Bagnadrana (the dumpy-looking monster with armored plates and a
 tail), you may want to run around until you do, since you can steal
 a Diamond Pin from it.

 When you're ready to go, take the other path to the east.  You'll arrive
 at a suspension bridge.  If your party is low on HPs, you may want to
 refill them here, since there is a very high rate of getting "Side
 Attacked" by Cokatolis enemies in this area.  Once you cross the bridge,
 you'll arrive at the town of North Corel.

 There's not much to do here, although there are some people who will
 sell you items, and you can sleep for 50 gil a night in the building
 atopt the eastern hill.

 If you want to save your game before continuing, exit North Corel by
 going to the southeast.  This will take you to the World Map.  After
 saving your game, go back into town and head to the west to reach the
 Golden Saucer ropeway station.

 Here, Barret will talk about his past for a while.  When he's done, you
 can ride the trolley up to the Gold Saucer.

 (N)  Corel Prison
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Silver Armlet, Ramuh materia.
 
 Items to steal:
  - Platinum Bangle (from Death Claw)

 Enemy Skills in this section:
  - Matra Magic (from Bullmotor), Laser (from Death Claw),
    Aqualung (from Harpy).

 Equipped on Cait Sith:
  - Yellow M-Phone, Silver Armlet, Manipulate materia, Transform materia.
  
 Once you arrive at the Gold Saucer, you'll notice a Save Point in the
 background.  However, it costs 5 GP to use it.  Here in the Gold Saucer,
 you can collect a special type of currency called GP (gold pieces), that
 can be used to buy things, etc.  Just something to keep in mind as you
 look around the Saucer.

 Before you can enter, you'll have to buy a pass.  Although you can get
 a one-time-only pass for 3000 gil, I recommend buying the lifetime pass,
 if you can afford it.  You'll be coming back here frequently, so it's
 worth the 30,000 gil price tag, if you can spare the money.

 Inside the Saucer, you can choose to take someone with you.  If you try
 to leave without taking anyone, Aeris will insist on coming with you.
 Feel free to look around the Saucer, if you like.  One place you'll want
 to stop by is the Ghost Square.  Go into the hotel and read the sign
 that says "Shop" next to the entrance on the west wall.  It's actually
 the third "Turtle's Paradise" flyer.

 The entrance, by the way, leads to a shop, where you can buy the
 following items:

 Eventually, you'll have to end up going to the Wonder Square.  Here,
 you'll run into a talking cat named Cait Sith who will join your party.
 He has a very useful "Manipulate" materia on him.  Not only can you use
 it to control certain enemies, but you can make them use Enemy Skills
 on you (some skills can only be learned in this way).  You can also
 manipulate an enemy and have your allies "Steal" from it repeatedly
 until they get something, while the enemy sits there, helpless.

 Anyway, you can earn GP at the Wonder Square by playing the various
 games there.  One way to get an easy 30 GP is to play the "Mog House"
 game in the back room.  To play, just keep feeding nuts to Mog until
 he gives a happy squeak, then wait for him to try to fly.  The first
 time you beat the game, the man standing behind you will give you 30 GP.
 Unfortunately, this only happens the first time you play "Mog House"
 so don't bother with it afterwards.

 There is also a "Wonder Catcher" game that can net you various prizes,
 such as the following:

         <nothing>, 1gp, 3gp, Potion, Phoenix down, Elixir

 The lady near the Wonder Square entrance will also trade you items for
 GP:

                Potion            1 gp
                Ether            20 gp
                X-Potion         80 gp
                Turbo Ether     100 gp
                Gold Ticket     300 gp
                ???????????     500 gp  (actually "Carob Nut")

 When you're done looking around the Gold Saucer, go to the Battle
 Square.  Cloud will run into the main room, and you will end up being
 caught by the owner of the Gold Saucer, Dio.  He wastes no time in
 tossing your party down into the Corel Prison.
 
 Once you're in control of Cloud, go south past the gate.  There is
 a Save Point to the south that you can use, and further southeast
 is a house that you can enter.  Barret will show up and do a little
 talking.  When he's done, you'll have to rearrange your party.  Now
 go outside and go to the southeast.

 There's a pub here, and the owner will sell you items if you talk
 to him.

 If you go back north around the pipe and head southwest, you'll find a
 big rig.  You can even sleep in the front end of it, if you like.

 There's nothing else to do but go all the way back north to where the
 fence was.  Once you reach it, walk to the west to return to the first
 area.  Here, there is a ladder to the northeast that you can climb
 down to reach the "basement" area.  There's nothing of note here,
 although you get "Side Attacked" by the 2-Faced enemies frequently
 in this area.  In the Japanese version of FF7, you could also meet an
 enemy called "Test Zero" here, that gave you tons of AP, and would talk
 to you if you attacked it.  It's not here anymore, though :(

 Anyway, if you go north, you'll find that the man guarding the gate is
 dead.  Go north from here to reach an area with a fence and a large
 crevice.  If you run around here, you can encounter the Bullmotors
 (purple motorcycle-like foes), who you can learn "Matra Magic" from.
 There are also Death Claws (claw-like enemies), who you can learn
 the "Laser" enemy skill from, and you can steal "Platinum Bangles"
 from them.  To make your job easier, you can always "Manipulate"
 either enemy using the Manipulate materia that Cait Sith had equipped.

 If you're willing to spend some time, you can always run to the north
 to reach the Corel Desert.  Here, you can encounter the "Cactuar"
 enemy, who will give you a whopping 10,000 gil when defeated.  They
 have a high evade rate and are immune to most magic, but you can use
 "L4 Suicide" on them, then attack repeatedly in the hope that someone
 hits.  Since they will have almost no life left, one good hit should
 do it.  There are also "Land Worm" enemies out here, but you can just
 manipulate them and kill them off with magic, so they pose no real
 threat.

 If you try to return to the Corel Prison, you'll find that the desert
 repeats itself endlessly.  Just run back and forth between two screens
 (i.e., run east until the screen changes, then run back west, then
 repeat).  Eventually, you'll come across a carriage that will offer
 to take you out of the desert (pick the top option to hop on).

 When you're ready to leave the Corel Prison (and you won't be able to
 come back, so make sure you've done everything that you want to in
 here beforehand), go back to the area with the crevice and the fence.
 Go through the opening in the fence (so that you above the crevice),
 and head east. You'll reach an old autoyard.  Work your way north,
 and you'll run into a boss who Barret will have to fight alone.
 
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Dyne
                LV: 23        XP:  600       Steal:  <nothing>
                HP: 1200      AP:  55        Morph:  <cannot>
                MP: 20        Gil: 750       Leaves: Silver Armlet

                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Corel Desert

 If Barret has the W Machine Gun, you might as well put him in the
 back row to increase his defense power (or if he still has the Atomic
 Scissors, equip the Long Range materia).  Dyne doesn't have a lot of
 life, so as long as you have "Cure" or "Cure2" handy, you can just
 plug away at him and heal when necessary until he's dead.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 After the battle, Cloud will have to participate in the Chocobo races.
 Once you reach the lobby and meet Joe (who is alternately referred to
 as "Teioh" elsewhere in the game), look for the "Ramuh" materia lying
 near an alcove on the north wall, near the "Chocobo Racing" poster.
 If you don't get this materia now, you'll never be able to get it
 again, so don't miss it.  When Ester shows up, talk to her, and pick
 the bottom option to start the race.

 There are two ways to control your Chocobo; via Manual or Automatic
 control.  In "Automatic" mode, the Chocobo races itself, and you don't
 have to do anything.  In "Manual" mode, you control the Chocobo.  Here
 are the basic controls:

        Square button   Makes your Chocobo run faster
        X button        Makes your Chocobo slow down
        Circle button   Makes your Chocobo dash
        Select button   Switches between Manual and Automatic mode.
        Start button    Once the 1st and 2nd place winners have come
                        in, you can press Start to end the race early
                        (instead of waiting for it to end).

 While racing, there is a red gauge on the left side of the screen.
 This is the Chocobo's "Stamina meter", and it gradually drains as
 your Chocobo runs (the faster your speed, the faster it drains).
 If you hold down the Circle button to dash, then it drains at a much
 faster rate.  When the gauge is empty, you can't dash, and your top
 speed is reduced.

 However, there is a trick to refill your Stamina Gauge; simply hold
 down R1 + R2 while racing.  This causes the gauge to refill slightly
 when not draining, and when it does drain, it does so at a slower
 rate than normal.

 If you lose the Chocobo race, you'll just have to keep racing until you
 win.  Once you do, you'll have to choose who you want in your party.
 Afterwards, you'll find yourself outside in the Buggy.

 Moving around in the buggy is not that different from walking; you can
 still be attacked by monsters, save your game, etc.  However, the buggy
 can move around in the desert around the Gold Saucer, and it can cross
 shallow rivers (areas where the water is a lighter color).

 Once you're outside, you may want to save your game.  Then, pilot the
 buggy around in the desert until you encounter the "Harpy" enemy.  You
 can learn the Enemy Skill "Aqualung" from it.  Note that you can always
 drive the Buggy into the house below the Gold Saucer to return to the
 Corel Desert.  This is really only useful if you want to fight Cactuars
 for money, since you can't go to the Corel Prison or Dyne's house from
 the desert.  If you get lost in the desert, just keep switching between
 screens by running left and right over and over until the carriage shows
 up (it won't show up if you're running vertically).  Alternately, if you
 find yourself back in the area with the crevice cutting across it, you
 can exit to the east to return to the World Map.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (O)  Gold Saucer / The Sleeping Man
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items to get from the Speed Square:
  - Umbrella,

 Items to get from the Wonder Square:
  - Speed Source.

 Items to get from the Battle Square:
  - Sprint Shoes.

 Items in this section:
  - Bolt and/or Ice Ring, Mythril (a Key Item)

 Enemy Skills in this section:
  - Big Guard (from Beach Plug), White Wind (from Zemzelett).
        
 If you want to go back to the Golden Saucer, you can just drive back to
 North Corel and take the trolley.  That's what we're going to do, as
 you can pick up some good items there.  Returning to the Gold Saucer
 right now is optional, however.  In fact, so is this whole section.  If
 you want to get on with the game, skip to Section P.  Otherwise, keep
 reading.

 Since it costs GP to use most of the Gold Saucer's attractions, you
 need to earn a lot of GP fairly quickly.  There are several ways to
 earn GP, some easier than others.  The first one depends on blind luck.
 Every time you go to the Gold Saucer, there is a random chance that a
 man will be standing by the tiny house near the back of the screen at
 the Gold Saucer entrance.  If you go back to him and talk to him, he
 will sell you 1 GP for 100 gil, and will sell you up to 100 GP at a
 time.  However, the chance of him appearing is very low.

 A much easier way to earn money is to play the G-Bike Game at the Wonder
 Square (it's on the 2nd floor).  It only costs 200 gil to play, and you
 will earn 10 GP if you manage to score 10,000 points or higher.  Here
 are some pointers:

  - You can swing your sword to the left by pressing Square, and to the
    right by pressing Circle.
  - Don't forget that it takes Cloud a second to swing after you press
    the button.  You can still move during this time, allowing you to
    reposition yourself while attacking, in case your target moves away.
  - Use your sword on the yellow bikes.  They're slower and are easier
    to hit.
  - Ram into the red bikes to destroy them.  You can demolish them in
    four hits (they will flash white when hit).
  - An easy way to do this is to trap them against the guard rails on
    either side of the road.  Don't bother using your sword on them, as
    they are too fast to be hit.
  - Your main goal should be to protect the truck from getting hit, as
    this will lower your score.  Try to stay near it whenever possible.
    However, if there is only one bike on screen, feel free to leave
    the truck momentarily to destroy the bike.

 Once you get the hang of it, you can earn over 10,000 points with each
 play without much difficulty.  The best part is, you win a free Speed
 Source the first time you earn 10,000 points or more.  And you can
 still earn 2 GP if you 5000 points or above.

 Another option is to play the "Basketball Game" on the 1st floor of
 the Wonder Square.  You have to hold the Circle button down for a
 moment, then release it.  If you don't hold it long enough (or hold
 it for too long), Cloud will miss.  Otherwise, he earns 1 GP with
 each successful shot, and you can keep shooting until you mess up.
 Everyone has their own little trick for timing the shot--mine is to
 say "Final Fantasy VII" under my breath, then release the button.
 It seems to work well, for some reason :)

 In any case, once you have enough GP, it's time to spend it (after
 returning to Corel and saving your game, of course).  Don't bother with
 the Wonder Square prizes.  Instead, go to the Speed Square.  For 10 GP,
 you can ride on a roller coaster and shoot at targets using the Circle
 button.  One big tip is to tap the Circle button rapidly instead of
 holding it, so that your laser's strength does not diminish.

 You can win a great weapon for Aeris here, so do give it a try.  I've
 written down a brief description of the course, so that you'll know
 where to shoot.  Feel free to pause the game frequently to refer to
 the list as you play:

  - When the track curves right, ghosts will appear on the right side
    of the screen.  Follow one to the left side of the screen, then hit
    a ghost that shows up on the left side once the track goes up.  Then
    aim back in the lower right corner to nab a few more ghosts.
  - There are more ghosts at the top of the hill, and until you approach
    the cave.
  - You can shoot the cacti in the cave before you actually enter it.
  - Inside the cave, you can shoot at the planes and cacti.
  - Watch for a falling rock on the right side of the screen that has
    a shootable cacti atop it.
  - As you come out of the cave, keep firing in the far east corner.
    There is a large rock you can hit for 200 points that is just
    offscreen.
  - Afterwards, there are more planes to shoot at.  When you approach the
    lake, a yellow fish will leap out.
  - A riverboat will show up, that scrolls to the left as the track
    turns right.  You can shoot at it's red paddle to earn an increasing
    amount of points.  Follow the paddle to the lower left corner of the
    screen and keep firing, even after the boat goes offscreen.  Do this
    until your score stops going up.
  - As the track curves up towards the upper right, two more fish jump
    out, then stars slowly descend from the sky.  Shoot as many as you
    can.
  - Inside the ice cave, you can shoot at the stalagtites as well as
    the moving ice sparkles.
  - Outside, many balloons will come up from the lower portion of the
    screen, then from the lower right corner.  There is also a bunny
    balloon that shows up near the end worth more points.
  - Then UFOs appear, as well as missiles.  The missiles are easier
    targets as they don't move erratically.  Stay in the lower right
    corner at first, then move towardss the middle of the screen to
    bag the most targets.
  - In the lava cave, shoot the red balls that arc into the air.  As
    you arrive, aim in the upper left corner, so that when the track
    swings you back to the left, you'll hit the falling ball seen
    earlier.
  - On the way up, shoot at the helicopters.
  - At the top, you'll fight a big UFO.  You can hit it even when it
    moves out of sight.  Don't forget to tap the button rapidly instead
    of holding it so that your laser power doesn't decrease.
  - Once it is destroyed, you'll go back down.  A few planes and a
    helicopter show up once the track levels out.
  - When lights appear on either side of the track, one of them on
    the left side can be shot out halfway through.  Aim at the source
    of the light beams to hit it.
  - Alternately, there is a light near the end of the track on the
    right side that you can hit, instead.

 If you earn 5000 points or more, you'll get the Umbrella for Aeris.
 Afterwards, you'll just win a bunch of useless prizes no matter what
 score you get (such as the 1/35 soldier, Masamune Blade, and Super
 Sweeper).  These have no purpose, so don't bother with them.

 Next up is a visit to the Battle Square.  Talk to the lady to the left
 of the stairs and choose the first option ("That's the idea").  Now go
 inside.  This is the Battle Square.  Here's how it works:

 For 10 GP, you can pick one character and have them fight eight sets
 of enemies in one consecutive battle.  However, there is a catch.
 After each battle, a roulette-like device starts spinning, and you
 must press Circle to make it stop.  When it stops, you will be
 afflicted with a certain condition.  The conditions last for the
 remainder of the battle and are as follows:

   Sword                Weapon is unequipped.
   Bracelet             Armor is unequipped.
   Ring                 Accessory is unequipped.
   Item Bag             Item command is disabled.
   Green Materia        Magic materia are disabled.
   Yellow Materia       Command materia are disabled.
   Purple Materia       Independent materia are disabled.
   Blue Materia         Support materia are disabled.
   Red Materia          Summon materia are disabled.
   Five Materia         All materia are disabled.
   Leather Boot         Speed is cut in half.
   Stopwatch            Total game time x30 = damage inflicted on you.
   Blue Cure            Restores HP
   HP Sign              Max HP is halved.
   MP Sign              Max MP is halved.
   HP/MP Sign           Max HP/MP is halved.
   MP Zero              Current MP drops to zero.
   Small Lv Down        EXP Level goes down by 5.
   Big Lv Down          EXP Level goes down by 10.
   Poison Bubbles       Afflicted with "Poison" ailment.
   Mini-Cloud           Afflicted with "Mini" ailment.
   Lucky 7              No handicap.
   Frog                 Afflicted with "Frog" ailment.

 Keep in mind that if you are protected from status ailments (such
 as having a Ribbon equipped), nothing will happen if you get the
 Frog, Mini, or Poison conditions.

 If you win all eight battles, you will earn Battle Points (BP).  BP can
 then be exchanged for prizes by examining the vending machines in the
 lower left and right corners of the screen.  You cannot save your BP as
 you can GP; it will reset to zero once you leave the Battle Square room.
 You will earn zero BP if you are killed in battle, or if you run away.
 Keep in mind that any damage you take in the Battle Square is "faked"
 and won't affect you in reality.  The same applies to using your Limit
 Breaks--the meter will return to whatever level it was prior to you
 beginning a fight.

 Note that you cannot earn EXP, AP, or Gil from the monsters you fight
 in the Battle Arena.  What's more, you cannot learn Enemy Skills from
 them.  However, you can Steal from them and Morph them into items.

 For right now, we don't need to worry about earning BP, since we're
 not after any of the prizes (and they aren't that good at this time
 anyway, unless you want to pick up a Enemy Lure, Pre-Emptive, or
 Speed Plus materia).  All we want to do is win eight battles in a row.
 I recommend picking a character with a high level.  If you don't have
 the Long Range materia, then pick someone with a long range weapon,
 like Barret or Yuffie, and put them in the back row.  Then give that
 character an Enemy Skills materia, a Restore materia, and the Silver
 Armlet.  It may help to equip them with the Fire Ring or Star Pendant.

 To get through battle, concentrate on keeping your life up and killing
 off enemies as quickly as possible.  Use cheap Enemy Skills like Matra
 Magic to kill off groups of enemies.  If you watch the roulette that
 spins between rounds, you can actually time it to get the desired
 condition to show up.  This is useful when you want to pick the least
 detrimental condition to afflict your character with.

 Once you've won eight battles, spend any BP you might have earned,
 then go back outside and talk to the lady at the base of the stairs.
 She's so impressed with your fighting skills that she'll give you a
 free set of Sprint Shoes.

 There's not much left to do here aside from visiting the Ghost Hotel
 in the Ghost Square.  If you read the "Shop" sign to the left of the
 item shop entrance, you will find a Turtle's Paradise flyer posted
 there, if you haven't read it already.  In the Hotel Shop, you can buy
 the following items:

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 Your next goal is to head onto Gongaga, but we're going to take a little
 detour first.  Feel free to skip to Section (P) if you want to get on
 with the game.

 From the Golden Saucer, head north.  You should see a river with a
 shallow area that you can ford across.  Keep heading north until you
 reach Costa del Sol.  If you go down to the coast and run around on the
 beaches, you'll run into the "Beach Plug" enemy.  You can then use the
 Manipulate materia to control them and make them cast "Big Guard" on
 your characters.  This is an incredibly useful skill to learn, since
 it casts Haste, Barrier, and MBarrier on your entire party.  Although
 both barriers wear off faster than casting "Barrier" or "MBarrier",
 the Haste effect remains for the rest of the battle (or until you
 are killed).

 Once you've gotten that Enemy Skill, it's time to take the buggy back to
 Junon.  Get in the buggy and drive it _into_ Costa del Sol.  Once you're
 in control of Cloud, go up the stairs and go across the bridge to return
 to the harbor.  Talk to the sailor near the boat, and pay him 100 gil
 (choose the top option).  Then run onto the boat.  It will go back
 across the sea to Junon.

 Now, you could exit Junon manually, but if you go out to where the
 shops are, there will be a sailor standing in the middle of the road.
 Talk to him and pick the top option, and a helicopter will come down.
 You can then ask the helicopter to deposit you on the other side of
 Junon (the top option), or to take you outside of Junon (the bottom
 option).

 If you decide to leave Junon on foot, go back to the L-shaped chamber
 at the far east end of town, and go through the opening to the
 southeast.  This will take you to an elevator you can operate to take
 you down to the town below Junon.  Once you get back onto the World
 Map, you'll find that your Buggy has come with you.

 Since you now have the Manipulate materia, you can learn another
 Enemy Skill in this area.  Just find a Zemzelett (the large green
 and white enemy).  You can control it and make it use the "White
 Wind" skill on you.  

 You can also return to Fort Condor and help them fight another war.
 When I came back here, I was told that the Shinra had invaded once
 while I was away, but in all of my earlier saves, it was impossible
 to return to the Fort, since the cargo ship in Costal del Sol was
 "under Heidegger's orders" to remain in port.  Does anyone know how
 to get back to the fort in time for the third battle?

 Now that you have the buggy, look for a river that lies to the east
 of Junon, behind a mountain range.  There is a shallow area you can
 go across.  If you go northeast, you should find a cave in the side
 of the mountains.  Inside is a sleeping man who will tell you how
 many battles you've been in so far.  What's more, he will give you
 a reward depending on how many battles you've fought (not how many
 you've won, just how many you were actually in):

   - If the last two digits of your battle count are even (such as
     88, 244, etc.) he will give you a Bolt Ring or Ice Ring.

   - If the last two digits of your battle count are odd (such as
     99, 255, 477, 799, etc.) he'll give you a piece of Mythril.

 Sometimes, the man will also tell you how many times you escaped from
 a battle.  I've never gotten a reward for having a particular "escape"
 count, though, and the number of escapes doesn't seem to effect the
 chance of him giving you a particular type of ring, etc.

 If you already have a piece of Mythril and try to get another piece,
 nothing will happen.  However, if you get rid of your Mythril (by
 selling it to the weaponsmith near Gongaga after getting the Tiny
 Bronco), you can always come back and get another piece.

 However, you can get as many Bolt or Ice Rings as you want.  If you find
 that you don't have the right amount of wins by the time you get here,
 you can always just fight until your numbers match up.  However,
 sometimes he will not give you a ring even if you have the appropriate
 number (for example, I talked to him after getting 288 / 466 / 488 /
 766 / 788 / 800 / 888 wins and received nothing).
                 
 Once you get a piece of Mythril, there's not much to do here.  If you
 missed some Enemy Skills the first time around (such as getting Beta
 from Midgar Zolom), or want to put them on that second Enemy Skill
 materia you got in Junon, you can always do that now.  Otherwise, you
 might as well return to the western continent.  To do so, drive the
 buggy into Junon.  While you could go all the way through Junon to the
 docks, a much faster way to get onto the cargo ship is to go to the
 beach where you met Priscilla and the dolphin.  If you go up to the
 shore and press Square, you'll summon the dolphin, and can ride it
 directly to the cargo ship.

 Once you arrive in Costa del Sol, pilot the buggy back to the Gold
 Saucer (head south) to continue the game.

 (P)  Gongaga Town
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Fairy Tale, X-Potion x2, Titan materia, Deathblow materia,
    White M-Phone.

 Enemy Skills in this section:
  - Frog Song (from Touch Me).

 From the Gold Saucer, drive the buggy south.  Right where the desert
 area ends, there is a river with a shallow area that you can cross.
 On the other side of the river, you should see a forest next to some
 cliffs, and if you turn west, you'll see a peninsula with a house at
 the far end.  There's no reason to go to the house right now (as nobody
 is home), but if you got some Mythril from the sleeping man (see the
 previous section), then you can trade it with the house's owner later
 on.

 For now, check out the large forest near the cliffs.  There is a black
 structure in the middle of the forest that you can explore.  While this
 area is optional (you don't have to go here), this is your only chance
 to fight the Turks here, and get some good treasure from them.  So, I
 recommend that you explore it now :)

 As soon as you enter the black structure, you'll run into the Turks.
 No matter what you say to them, you'll still have to fight Reno and Rude
 at the same time.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Turks:Reno
                LV: 22        XP:  1380      Steal:  <nothing>
                HP: 2000      AP:  130       Morph:  <cannot>
                MP: 80        Gil: 3500      Leaves: Fairy Tale
                No Effect:  Gravity
                Ability:    Turk Light
                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Meltdown Reactor (2nd encounter)
                Notes:      Since you fight both Turks at the same time,
                            the XP/AP/Gil amounts listed are for both of
                            them.

 Turks:Rude
                LV: 23        XP:  1380      Steal:  <nothing>
                HP: 2000      AP:  130       Morph:  <cannot>
                MP: 135       Gil: 3500      Leaves: X-Potion
                No Effect:  Gravity
                Ability:    [Attack], Cure, Fire
                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Meltdown Reactor
                Notes:      Since you fight both Turks at the same time,
                            the XP/AP/Gil amounts listed are for both of
                            them.

 The easiest way to win this match is to use Sleepel on both Turks (pair
 it with All in order to save time), then kill them off with spells or
 Enemy Skills (both "Aqualung" and "Beta" do tons of damage).  Once you
 do enough damage to either Turk, they will flee, immediately followed by
 the other one.  If you don't want to put them to sleep, I recommend
 killing off Rude, simply because he can use "Cure" to heal himself or
 Reno.  If you don't have many HPs, use "Big Guard" to reduce damage and
 Cure + All or "White Wind" to keep your life up, since the Turks can do
 a lot of damage with their attacks.

 Keep in mind that which Turk is defeated first determines what item you
 get.  If you want both of them, you'll need to defeat both Turks at the
 same time (i.e. use the All materia to hit them with a spell at the same
 time or use an Enemy Skill that hits more than one target).
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
                                         
 After the battle ends, take the path northeast and then head north to
 reach the ruins of a melted Mako reactor.  If you try to get close to
 the core, Scarlet and Tseng will show up.  After they leave, examine
 the area where Scarlet was standing to find the "Titan" materia.

 Now, return to where you met the Turks, and follow the path west.  In
 the next screen, head west to where the paths divert.  If you follow
 the west path, you'll find a "Deathblow" materia lying on the ground,
 in the shadow of a fallen tree.  After getting it, take the northeast
 path to reach Gongaga village.

 In the Accessory Shop, you can buy items, or you can climb up the nearby
 pole to reach the Weapons Shop.

 You can find a White M-Phone in a treasure chest in the northernmost
 house.  In the house to the west of it, there is another chest which
 contains an X-Potion.  You can also spend the night here for 80 gil.

 In the southeastern house (the one facing away from the screen), live
 the parents of a man named Zack.  Depending on who is in your party
 the first time you talk to them (namely Aeris and/or Tifa), you'll get
 a different reaction from your teammates.

 There's nothing left to do but leave town and return to the World Map.
 If you haven't already learned "Frog Song" from the Touch Mes (the frog
 enemies), then you can encounter them in the wilderness outside of
 Gongaga village.

 Once you leave, get back in the buggy and head south, following the land
 as it curves west towards a river.  There is a shallow area you can ford
 across.  On the other side, go up into the mountains.  You'll eventually
 reach a village built into one of the cliffs.  You might as well go into
 it, since if you try to move past the village, your buggy will break
 down.

 (Q)  Cosmo Canyon
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Elixir, Added Effect materia, Black M-Phone, Ether, X-Potion,
    Fairy Ring, Turbo Ether, Gravity materia, Wizer Staff, Seraph Comb.

 Enemy Skills in this section:
  - Death Sentence (from Sneaky Step).

 Once you gain access to the village, head to the northeast.  There is
 a door in the side of the cliff, just northwest of the "Cosmo Candle,"
 that leads to the Shildra Inn (it's supposed to be "Syldra," the name of
 a summoned monster from Final Fantasy 5).  Inside, climb up the stairs
 to the second floor and look at the gold flyer on the wall.  It turns
 out to be another Turtle's Paradise flyer.  Then go through the door
 into the bedroom.  You can find an Elixir lying on the couch, even
 though you can't see it.

 Now leave the inn, and climb up the ladder to the east.  It leads to an
 item shop.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Cosmo Canyon General Store
    Potion                   50 gil     Item

    Tent                    500 gil     Item
    Maiden's Kiss           150 gil     Item

    Tranquilizer            100 gil     Item
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 You may notice that there is another room to the west of the shop that
 you can't get to, since a red rope is in your way.  Don't worry about it
 for now; you can get back there after returning to Cosmo Canyon in Disc
 2.

 Go outside and head up the stairs to the far west.  After talking to Red
 XIII on the landing, your party will split up.  You can find your allies
 in various parts of town (depending on who they are).  If you're more
 interested in finding Red XIII, go up the stairs and through the opening
 to find a weapons shop and a Save Point.  There is also another Turtle's
 Paradise flyer posted near the stairs.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Tigerlily Weapon Shop
    Butterfly Edge         2800 gil     Weapon (for Cloud)
    Tiger Fang             2500 gil     Weapon (for Tifa)
    Heavy Vulcan           2700 gil     Weapon (for Barret)
    Prism Staff            2600 gil     Weapon (for Aeris)

    Green M-phone          2400 gil     Weapon (for Cait Sith)
    Silver Armlet          1300 gil     Armor
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 If you're more concerned with Materia growth than attack power, I would
 suggest skipping these weapons, since your characters probably all have
 double-growth weapons by now (i.e. Force Stealer, White M-Phone, Magic
 Comb, etc.)

 To continue on, go up the stairs and take the west exit, then go up
 the stairs to the third floor.  If you go through the southern exit,
 you'll find a materia store.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Cosmo Canyon Materia Shop
    MP Plus                8000 gil     Independent materia
    HP Plus                8000 gil     Independent materia

    Transform              5000 gil     Magic materia
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 When you're done shopping, return to the main area and climb up the
 ladder to reach the canyon's observatory.  After talking to Bugenhagen,
 he will invite you to bring along two of your friends.  So just find
 one of your allies (they're scattered throughout the town), and talk
 to them to bring up the member switch screen.  Once you've made a party
 of three people, return to the observatory and go through the door
 near the table.

 After Bugenhagen finishes explaining the mechanics of the planet to
 you, go back to the "Cosmo Candle" (the bonfire near the town entrance).
 Your teammates will have gathered here.  Talk to each one of them, then
 talk to Red XIII.  Bugenhagen will show up, and then you'll have to form
 a party consisting of Cloud, Red XIII, and one other person.  Now go
 back to the third floor, where the large metal door was.  Bugenhagen
 will open it.  Inside, climb down the ropes to the bottom and then head
 east.

 You are now in the Cave of the Gi.  You can learn "Death Sentence" from
 the Sneaky Steps or Gi Spectors (and you can manipulate them to make it
 easier on you).  What's more, the Gi Spectors are undead, so they can
 be damaged by using curative items or spells (such as a Potion, or a
 Cure2 spell, etc.)  Revival techniques (like a Phoenix Down or the Life
 spell) will kill them instantly, but tend to have a high miss rate (you
 can always pair Life with All to try and hit all enemies at once).  If
 you really want to go for overkill, try using White Wind on them--it
 kills them while inflicting just about every status ailment there is.

 Also, you may want to equip characters with anti-poison items (like the
 Star Pendant), since the "Heg" enemies (they look like snakes) can
 poison you when they attack.

 Anyway, in this first area, you will notice holes in the walls that you
 can enter.  In the back of each hole is a rock you can break.  If you
 break it, you will be attacked.  So ignore the other holes (unless you
 want some EXP), and head east until you see a hole that faces left
 instead of right.  Go inside it and break the rock you find to open up
 an entrance in the northern wall.

 In the next area, head east.  There is some oil on the ground here, so
 walk across it instead of running.  If you run, you'll slide into the
 west wall, which has a spike trap.  This reduces everyone's life, but
 it also has the odd side effect of reviving any dead members to 1 HP.
 Go figure :)

 Once you've walked past the oil, head south to return to the first area.
 If you go to the west, you'll find an "Added Effect" materia lying on
 the ground.  This materia basically works like the "Elemental" materia,
 but it affects status ailments, not damage types.  For example, if you
 pair Haste and Added Effect on your armor, you would be protected from
 both the "Slow" and "Stop" ailments.  Likewise, if you equip it on your
 weapon, you can attack with a certain status ailment (i.e. if you put
 the above pairing on your weapon, your attacks may inflict either the
 "Slow" or "Stop" status on a hit opponent).

 Now go back to the area with the oil and head east until you reach the
 wall.  Then go north until you reach another path that heads west.
 Follow it until you reach the stairs, then go down them and take the
 southwest path until you reach a treasure chest.  It contains the
 Black M-Phone.  Now go back to the stairs and take the northeast path
 to find another chest, which holds an Ether.  Go back up the stairs
 and follow the northwest path to reach the next area.

 Here, there are five paths that branch off in various directions.
 Start off by taking the fourth passage from the left.  You'll see a
 large spider web blocking the path.  When you touch it, you'll have
 to fight a "Stinger" enemy.  They can be dangerous since their "Sting
 Bomb" ability does a ton of damage.  Try using Sleepel to put them to
 sleep, then kill them off with spells.
                                       
 Continue north to find a chest containing an X-Potion.  Now return to
 the five openings and take the 2nd one from the left.  After fighting
 another Stinger, go to the west and follow the path south.  However, if
 you try running to the southwest, you'll find an alternate route that
 leads to a chest containing a Fairy Ring.

 Now go north to where the "main" path was, and continue north to find
 another spiderweb.  After killing the Stinger, you can head to the
 northwest to find a hidden path leading to that last treasure chest.
 It contains a Turbo Ether.

 Now go back and take the main path north.  You'll arrive at a room with
 a large face on the north wall.  Approach the face, and you will be
 attacked.

                Notes:      Since this enemy is undead, it can be damaged
                            with restorative items and spells.

 Soul Fire
                LV: 21        XP:  200       Steal:  <nothing>
                HP: 1300      AP:  20        Morph:  <nothing>

                No Effect:  *Gravity, Earth, Water, Poison, Poison,
                            Silence, Sleep, Death Sentence, Berserk,
                            Paralysis, Confuse*
                Weakness:   Wind, Holy power
                Ability:    Fire2
                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Cave of the Gi (appears with Gi Nattak)

 You can kill the boss instantly by using a Phoenix Down, but it's easy
 for the Phoenix Down to miss.  Using curative items on him will damage
 Gi Nattak, so a powerful item like an X-Potion or Elixir will do enough
 damage to kill him outright.  If you don't want to waste items, you can
 always use a Life spell to kill him in one go.  Otherwise, try using
 White Wind on him.  It will do a good deal of damage if your life is
 high enough, and it can inflict several status ailments on him (like
 Darkness and Slow).

 If you're going to be macho and actually fight him, things get a little
 complicated.  Gi Nattak himself is no threat--he can't do much damage to
 you.  The Soul Fires are the real problem.  Not only can they attack you
 with Fire2 (which they also use to heal themselves), but when Gi Nattak
 uses the "Take Over" ability, a Soul Fire will inhabit the body of one
 of your characters.  You can still control your character, but you can't
 attack the Soul Fire, and it will cast Fire2 on that person over and
 over.  So how do you get rid of a Soul Fire that's inside someone?  The
 only way is to attack your teammate until they take enough damage.  Or
 just kill them off, then revive them.

 While you can kill a Soul Fire, it's more trouble than it's worth, as
 they will probably take a character over before being killed.  If you
 are after the extra XP/AP/Gil, though, go ahead and give it a shot.
 Ice2 or Shiva works well, but don't bother with Aqualung or any fire-
 based attack.

 Obviously, it helps if someone has the Fire Ring equipped, and you
 can pair Elemental + Fire or Ifrit on someone else's armor to halve
 the damage from those constant "Fire2" attacks.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 After killing Gi Nattak, don't forget to pick up the Gravity materia
 lying on the floor before following Bugenhagen.  Once you're in control
 of Cloud, you'll have to make a party of three.  If you check your
 inventory, you'll see that you also got the Seraph Comb.  Once you try
 to leave the town, Red XIII will rejoin your party.

 If your buggy broke down, a repairman by the town entrance will tell you
 that he fixed it.  If you pay him 1000 gil in gratitude, he'll also tell
 you about the Elixir lying on the couch in the Shildra Inn.  If your
 buggy didn't break down, then none of this will happen ;)

 Fist.  If you look at Tifa's desk, you can find a report that explains
 the history of the town.

 You can also play Tifa's piano by choosing the second option.  You will
 then be asked if you remember how to play.  Choosing either option will
 let you play the piano, but the top option will also bring up a list of
 controls.  Remember the song Cloud played during the flashback sequence
 in Kalm Town?  It went like this:

                "Do Re Mi Ti La Do Re Mi So Fa Do Re Do."

 So how do you play it?  Let's use the following notation:

        S = Square   T = Triangle    O = Circle      X = Cross

 You would then play the song by inputting the following commands:

              X, S, T, L1+T, L1+S, X, S, T, L1+X, O, X, S, X

 If you experiment with the buttons, you'll see that there are other
 ways of playing the same song.  This is just the method that I like
 to use.

 Anyway, if you play the song three times in a row, you'll find 1 gil.
 There's more to the piano than that, but you don't need to worry about
 it for now.

 When you're done here, you can always check out the Shinra Mansion that
 is just north of the houses.  You don't have to go there, but if you
 don't explore it now, you'll miss out on a free materia.

 Inside the mansion, go to the west and examine the notes lying in the
 small antechamber.  You'll find some hints explaining how to open a
 safe found somewhere in the building.

 The hints are as follows:

 1.  The lid of the box with the most oxygen.
 2.  Behind the Ivory's short of tea and ray.
 3.  The creek in the floor near the chair on the second floor...
     then to the left five steps, up nine steps, left two steps,
     and up six steps.
 4.  (blank)

 If you can't figure them out, here are the answers:

 1.  Open the chest in the greenhouse, then examine it.
 2.  Go over to the piano in the west room on the bottom floor.
     Then examine the ground near the northeast corner of the piano.
     You have to be standing above the piano, not beneath it.
 3.  Go into the east room on the second floor and examine the chair
     next to the bed.  You'll hear a creaking sound, and Cloud will
     turn around and face north.  Then just follow the directions.
     You'll end up standing in the hallway outside the room, near to
     the door that leads into the room with the treasure chest.  You
     can examine the floor here to get the third number.
 4.  If you try to select the blanks pace benath "dial (3)" you will
     find an entry written in invisible ink that reads "Right 97"

 The chest can be found in the room north of the greenhouse on the 2nd
 floor.  We'll be going there shortly, but if you want to do it now,
 you can always skip ahead a few paragraphs.  If you don't want to
 bother with the hints, don't worry, I'll tell you what the correct
 numbers are later on, when you find the safe.
 
 Now go back to the main hall and go north, through the door beneath the
 stairs.  You'll end up in a hallway.  Head east into the side room and
 go north to find a chest containing the Twin Viper.  Then go back to the
 main hall and look for an opening on the east wall, near the stairs.
 You can then go east to reach the other part of the room you were just
 in.  You can find a Silver M-Phone inside the chest.

 Return to the main hall once again and go up both sets of stairs, then
 head to the west.  If you look in the greenhouse, there is a chest which
 contains an Enemy Launcher.

 North of the greenhouse is a room with a safe.  If you want to try and
 open it, go ahead, but be warned--you'll have to fight a monster that's
 inside.  The key to opening up the safe is to remember that it's just
 like a real combination lock; in other words, you can't go past the
 correct numbers (i.e. you don't want to move all the way through 99 just
 to get back to 01).  To open the safe, turn the dial like so:

                right to 36, left to 10, right to 59, right to 97

 Once the safe opens, you'll have to fight a boss.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Lost Number
                LV: 35        XP:  2000      Steal:  <nothing>
                HP: 7000      AP:  80        Morph:  <cannot>
                MP: 300       Gil: 2000      Leaves: Cosmo Memory
                No Effect:  Gravity
                Ability:    Bolt2, [Punch], [Tentacle],
                            Lost Blow (purple half only)
                            Quake2, Bio2 (red half only)
                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Mansion, 2f.
                Notes:      Found inside the locked safe.

 At first, the boss will use physical attacks and magic on you, so giving
 someone a Bolt Ring is a good idea.  You can do a fair amount of damage
 on it by using Beta or Aqualung.  Quake2 is also effective, if you don't
 have the appropriate Enemy Skills, and you can always poison the boss
 with Bio.  I recommend starting off with Haste + All on your party; this
 is a good strategy for any boss fight, actually.

 After taking enough damage (usually when it has 3500 or less HP left),
 Lost Number will split into it's red or purple half.  Which half you
 fight is determined by which attack was used to get it's life below
 3500 points.  If you used a spell or Enemy Skill, it will split into
 it's red half.  If you used a physical attack, it will split into it's
 purple half.  Limit Breaks don't seem to count (so if you use a Limit
 Break to get the boss' life lower than 3500, it will not split until
 you attack it with either a physical attack or a magic spell, and will
 then split accordingly).
 
 The purple half relies on physical attacks, and can do massive damage
 with it's "Lost Blow" attack.  Aside from using "Big Guard" on your
 party, there's not much you can do aside from revive defeated teammates
 and keep your HPs up using White Wind or Cure2 + All.  However, since
 this half is vulnerable to spells, you can use the ones listed above
 to kill it in no time flat.

 The red half relies mainly on magical attacks, so you can lessen them
 by using Big Guard, or pair Bio + Elemental or Earth + Elemental on
 someone's armor to protect them.  Since it's resistant to magic, just
 use physical attacks and Limit Breaks until it dies.

 It's possible to kill the boss before it splits, but you have to cast
 "Stop" on it before it's life is too low.  There is a random chance
 that Choco/Mog will do this, or you can try pairing Choco/Mog or Time
 along with Added Effect on someone's weapon.  This gives their attack
 a small chance of inflicting "Stop" with each successful hit.  However,
 the XP/AP/Gil values stay the same no matter what form Lost Number is
 in when it dies.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 After defeating Lost Number, you can find a "Key to the Basement" in the
 safe, and there's an Odin materia lying on the floor nearby.

 Now head east back into the hallway, and keep going until you reach the
 left area of the mansion.  You can go into the upper room to find a
 chest containing a Magic Source.  Now go into the lower room.  If you
 don't remember where the hidden door was, try pressing against the
 curved wall to find the secret opening.

 Go down the hidden walkway until you reach the bottom, and run forward
 until the screen changes to a horizontal view.  If you got the "Key to
 the Basement" from the safe, you can open the door on the northern wall.
 Past it is a crypt.

 If you examine the coffin in the middle of the room, you'll meet another
 potential party member, Vincent Valentine.  You can get him to join you
 by picking the bottom option, ("talk about Sephiroth") when you have the
 chance.  After he reseals his coffin, open it again and pick the bottom
 option ("who are you?").  You'll then be able to name Vincent.  Once
 the coffin closes again, leave the crypt and act as if you're going to
 leave the caves (head back towards the ladder).  Vincent will then join
 you (and you can even put him in your party right now, if you want).

 Like Yuffie, all of Vincent's weapons are long ranged, so you can put
 him in the back row and he will still do full damage with each attack.

 Whether or not you decide to get Vincent, you need to go back to the
 basement library you visited in Cloud's flashback (it's to the east
 of the crypt room).  In here, you can examine the holding tanks on the
 south wall, if you like.  If you try to go to the back room, you'll run
 into Sephiroth.  After he leaves, you can pick up the Destruct materia
 that he threw at you.  If you go to the room in the back, you can look
 at the bookshelves to read several reports.

 There's nothing else to do here, so you might as well leave.  If you
 haven't yet gotten the "????" Enemy Skill from the Jersey enemies
 (they look like floating scales), you might want to hang around on
 the second floor of the mansion until you encounter them.  Since you
 can't manipulate them, the only way to get the Enemy Skill is wait
 around until they use it on you.  If you're having trouble killing
 them, keep in mind that they only take damage from physical attacks
 and Limit Breaks when their right scale is up, and are only damaged
 by magic attacks and Enemy Skills when their left scale is up.

 Also, you can win "Mirrors" from the "Mirage" enemies (they look like
 floating mirrors).  These will come in handy later on, so you might
 want to pick up a few of them.

 When you're ready to continue, leave the mansion and take the northern
 exit out of town.  You'll find yourself back out in the World Map.  If
 you head north, you'll reach the entrance to Mt. Nibel.  Follow the
 path until it splits, and take the north path.  It curves up around a
 spire of rock to a chest, containing the Rune Blade.  Now go back and
 follow the path to the west.  If you look closely, just before the
 bridge, there is a split in the path.  The split leads north into the
 high mountain peaks.  When your reach another fork in the road, take
 the lower path.  It leads up (after several twists) to a chest which
 contains the Plus Barrette.  If you're having trouble navigating the
 path, try pressing the Select button to bring up the position cursor.
                                      
 Now return to the bridge and go across it.  You'll find yourself in a
 large cavern.  There are several tubes labled from 1-5 here that you
 can go into, but the first thing you want to do is climb down the
 several sets of ladders to the ground floor.  This will allow you to
 get back up to the top of the cavern later on (since the third ladder
 will unfold when you try to go down it).  If you don't do this now,
 you won't be able to collect all of the treasures in this area without
 taking a lengthy detour.

 Once you're on the ground floor, head to the east.  You'll notice a
 large boss monster is sitting around here, and to the north of it is
 a Save Point.  You might as well go save your game first before
 tackling the boss.  If you don't want to fight it now, just skip ahead
 a bit, and keep reading.

 To fight the boss, go up to it and press the Circle button.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Materia Keeper
                LV: 38        XP:  3000      Steal:  <steal>
                HP: 8400      AP:  200       Morph:  <cannot>
                MP: 300       Gil: 2400      Leaves: Jem Ring
                Absorbs:    Fire
                No Effect:  Gravity, Sleep
                Ability:    [Attack], Big Horn, Hell Combo, Cure2, Trine
                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Mt. Nibel

 The Materia Keeper can do a lot of damage with it's physical attacks, so
 "Big Guard" comes in handy.  If you can equip someone with a Bolt Ring
 or Lightning + Elemental on their armor, it's a good idea, since "Trine"
 does a fair amount of damage.  Don't forget to have your two Enemy Skill
 materia equipped, so you can learn this ability.

 As usual, "Aqualung" works well here, as does Quake2.  You can also use
 Bio2 to poison the boss.  Don't bother with "Laser" or "Beta" (as they
 are Gravity and Fire attacks, respectively).
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 After the boss is killed, you can find a Counter Attack materia lying on
 the ground nearby.  Once the Materia Keeper is dead, you can always go
 down the passage it was blocking to leave Mt. Nibel and continue on with
 the game.  However, if you want to do some treasure hunting, then keep
 reading.

 Start off by climbing back up to the top of the cavern, and go into the
 tube with a "2" marked on it.  You'll land on a rock ledge.  Just to the
 south is a bag containing the Powersoul.  Hop down to the ground floor,
 then go back up to the tubes, and go down the tube labled "4".  You'll
 end up next to a chest containing an All materia.

 Now, drop down to the ground floor.  There are two ways to explore the
 rest of the mountain, and I'm going to go with the bottom route, just
 because you're already on the lowest level of the cavern.  If you look
 to the southwest of where the boss was, you'll see a path that heads
 south.  Outside, drop off the ledge you're on to the lower level, and
 go into the nearby cave entrance.

 Inside, take the east path up to the top of the cavern.  Instead of
 exiting through the north opening, look for a path that leads south
 and to the west, to another opening in the wall.  Go through the
 opening and follow it around and down to a treasure chest containing
 an Elixir.  Now go back up and exit through the north opening.  In
 the next area, you can find an Elemental materia lying to the west
 of the materia fountain.  Continue north and go through the cave
 entrance.

 Here, go northeast until the path splits, then go west to reach a
 chest containing the Sniper CR.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 If you have Vincent, the Sniper CR, and the Deathblow materia, it's
 possible to get Deathblow to work 100% of the time.  Since the Sniper
 CR's accuracy is 255%, it's impossible for Vincent to miss.  Needless
 to say, this can be pretty useful in battle, especially against bosses.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 Now go back to the split and take the east path, which leads south to
 another exit.  Outside, go to the left (the right path leads to a dead
 end).  It will eventually lead to the reactor you saw in Cloud's
 flashback.  There's nothing to do in the reactor, so circle around it
 to the east and go through the door behind the reactor.

 Voila!  You're back in the Materia Keeper's chamber.  Before leaving
 this level, you may consider saving your game at the Save Point and
 hanging around until you encounter Dragons.  You can steal Gold Armlets
 off them, for one thing.

 Another great thing about the Dragons is that they can be used to learn
 your second Limit Breaks very easily.  Simply manipulate one of them,
 and have them use "Flame Thrower" on one of your characters.  As long
 as they aren't wearing a Fire Ring or Fire + Elemental, they'll take a
 good deal of damage, filling up their Limit Break gauge (you can use
 Hypers on them to fill up their gauge even faster).  You can then heal
 them with Cure2 or White Wind, and repeat this until their Limit Break
 becomes available.

 Now, just use it on the Dragon.  Since this enemy has enough life to
 survive most Limit Breaks (save the instant kill types), you can heal
 the Dragon afterwards, and start from the beginning.  Remember, to
 get the second Limit Break of a certain level, you have to use the
 first one around 8-10 times.

 When you're ready to continue, just go to the ground floor and take the
 southeast path (the one guarded by the boss) to get outside of Mt.
 Nibel.  Then just follow the path until you're outside.

 Now that you're back on the World Map, make your way south and around
 the mountains as your path heads back to the northeast.  There's a town
 sitting out in the middle of the grasslands, so let's check it out.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (S)  Rocket Town
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Power Source, Yoshiyuki, Drill Arm, Edincoat.

 Equipped on Cid:
  - Spear, Gold Armlet.

 There's a Weapon Shop just to the west of the town entrance.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Rocket Town Weapon Shop
    Shotgun                3100 gil     Weapon (for Vincent)
    Gold Armlet            2000 gil     Armor
    Power Wrist            7500 gil     Accessory
    Protect Vest           3500 gil     Accessory
    Earring                7500 gil     Accessory
    Talisman               4000 gil     Accessory
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 If you go north a ways and go into the house that's all the way to the
 east, you can find a Power Source lying in a chest in the kitchen area.
 There's also an Item Shop in the house to the west (the one with an
 old man standing in front of it).

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Rocket Town Item Shop
    Potion                   50 gil     Item
    Hi-Potion               300 gil     Item
    Phoenix Down            300 gil     Item
    Ether                  1500 gil     Item
    Hyper                   100 gil     Item
    Tranquilizer            100 gil     Item
    Tent                    500 gil     Item
    Barrier               10000 gil     Magic materia
    Exit                  10000 gil     Magic materia
    Time                   6000 gil     Magic materia
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 If you talk to the old man, then talk to him again and pick the top
 option (agree to look at the rocket with him), he'll give you the
 Yoshiyuki as a reward.

 Now go into the house that's northeast of the old man.  There's a chest
 containing a Drill Arm in one of the rooms.  Next to it is a door that
 leads to a backyard, where you can find an airplane called the Tiny
 Bronco.  A woman named Shera will come out and talk to you, then tell
 you to speak with the Captain.  So let's go see him.  Leave the house
 and head north, towards the rocket launch pad.  When the screen changes
 to a close-up view of the launch pad, make your way clockwise around
 the base, then take the stairs and make your way up into the rocket.

 Inside, you'll meet the Captain.  When you talk to him, you'll get the
 chance to name him.  Afterwards, you can ask him several questions, but
 you need to at least ask him the first question ("Tell me about this
 rocket") in order to continue on with the game.  After asking that
 question, Cid won't say anything else, so leave and return to the house
 where you met Shera.  After talking to her, Palmer shows up.  After he
 arrives, go outside.  When Shera invites you back in, go out to the yard
 where the Tiny Bronco is.  When you approach Palmer, you'll have to
 fight him.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Palmer
                LV: 38        XP:  1800      Steal:  <nothing>
                HP: 6000      AP:  98        Morph:  <cannot>
                MP: 240       Gil: 5000      Leaves: Edincoat
                No Effect:  Gravity, *Silence, Invincibility, Sleep*
                Ability:    Mako Gun
                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Cid's House

 Palmer's Mako Gun is basically a weapon that casts attack spells, like
 Fire2, Bolt2 or Ice2.  So, having the appropriate Ring equipped, or
 using Elemental + the appropriate materia on your armor will help.
 Alternatively, you can cast "Big Guard" or "MBarrier" on your party
 to reduce the damage his Mako Gun inflicts.

 Both "Slow" and "Stop" can be used on Palmer.  If you haven't learned
 those spells yet, just pair Time + Added Effect on someone's weapon.
 With any luck, a successful hit will give him one (or both) of these
 status ailments.

 As for attack strategies, both Aqualung and Beta work wonders.  If you
 don't have them, you can always try Trine, Bio2 (which does good damage
 and may also poison him), or Fire2.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 After taking care of Palmer, you'll ride the Tiny Bronco out of Rocket
 Town and make a crash-landing in the water.  If you check your map,
 you'll see that you're near the far western continent of Wutai.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (T)  The Tiny Bronco
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Kjata materia, Gold Armlet and/or Great Gospel.

 Items to steal:
  - Dragon Scales (from Sea Worm)

 Up until now, the game has been fairly linear.  However, with the Tiny
 Bronco in your possession, you can go to many new places in the world
 that you couldn't have gotten to before, and you can revisit old areas
 with ease.  Here are some of the possible things you can do:

  - Go to the Bone Village (where you can get a free materia as well
    as purchase some double-growth Rune Armlets).

  - Go to Wutai if you haven't gotten Yuffie to join you yet
    (you can get some free items and buy some good ones, as well
    as learn two more Enemy Skills).

  - Go to Wutai if you have gotten Yuffie to join you (you can get all
    of the above plus tons of other stuff).

  - Go to the Blacksmith's house (you can trade your Mythril for some
    items here).

  - Go to Nibleheim (you can get the Buggy, drive back to Costa del Sol,
    and return to the eastern continent.  This is really only useful if
    you want to revisit the sleeping man mentioned in Section O.)

  - Go to any old area (you can use the Tiny Bronco to go back to Kalm
    Town, the Chocobo Farm, Junon, Cosmo Canyon, etc.)

  - Go to Mideel (this is an island in the southeast where you can earn
    tons of XP/AP/Gil very easily.  I recommend doing this after getting
    the Rune Armlets from Bone Village, though).

  - Go to the Gold Saucer (this is your current goal).

 My personal recommendation is to visit Wutai only if you haven't gotten
 Yuffie yet.  If you have (even if she's not in your current party), then
 a special sub-quest will take place if you try to go to Wutai.  There's
 nothing wrong with doing it now, it's just that you may have an easier
 time completing it if you level up at Mideel first, as it can be pretty
 difficult.

 If you want to go to Wutai (since you're already there, practically),
 then skip ahead to Section (U).  If you want to get on with the game's
 main quest and go to the Gold Saucer, then go to Section (W).

 Otherwise, I'm going to go through some of the other optional events,
 so keep reading.  It may be helpful to keep your map open (you can
 press Select repeatedly to toggle the map size), while you read through
 the rest of this section.

 Let's start by going to Bone Village first.  It's found on the southern
 edge of the northernmost continent.  To get there, you need to go from
 Wutai back to the mid-west continent and follow the western shore north
 (this will take you past Nibelheim and Rocket Town).  It will take your
 north and then around to the east, where the shallow waters extend to
 the northern continent.  Once you reach the bottom end of the northern
 continent, you should see a piece of curving shoreline with a forest
 nearby.  Lying in the middle of the forest are some large dinosaur
 bones.  That's Bone Village.

 Inside the village, you can talk to the man on the left to buy items.

 Getting a set of Rune Armlets is important, as they have a double growth
 feature.  If you're serious about mastering your materia, you can always
 wear them now, even though they have a lower defense rating than your
 Gold Armlets.  If you'd rather worry about working on your materia later
 on, then just keep in mind that this is where you can get them.  You can
 also get Diamond Bangles here, which have a very high defense rating and
 plenty of linked Materia slots (although if you're going for obscene
 defense levels, you might as well go to Wutai and steal the Adaman
 Bangle from Adamantaimais; though note that they only have two slots
 a piece).

 Now climb up to the upper level of Bone Village.  There is an exit in
 the northwest corner that leads to the Sleeping Forest.  Go into
 the forest and run past the first screen.  The next screen is shown in
 a sort of overhead view.  If you wait around and look carefully, you can
 see a red orb floating through the trees.  Grab it, and you'll get the
 Kjata materia.

 There's nothing else to do here, so leave and get back in the Tiny
 Bronco.  From here, you could conceivably go southeast and follow the
 shallow waters as they go past Kalm Town, the Chocobo Farm, etc. until
 you reach Mideel.  If you want to, go ahead.  However, even though it
 takes longer, I'm going to go back to Wutai and take it from there,
 since some people may not be interested in going to Bone Village, but
 want to do some of the other optional events.

 So, get in the Tiny Bronco and head southwest until you find yourself
 near the south end of the Wutai continent, since this is where you
 ended up after the Tiny Bronco crash landed in the first place.

 From here, if you look to the west, you should see the cliffs of Cosmo
 Canyon.  Follow the shallow waters northwest, and you'll reach a river
 that sits between Cosmo Canyon and Nibelheim.  The Tiny Bronco can
 move through rivers as well as shallow water, so go west along the
 river until it opens up into the sea.  If you look around, you should
 see a lone house on a peninsula to the east, and the Gold Saucer to the
 west.  Start off by visiting the house on the peninsula.

 If you came here earlier (back at the start of Section P, when you
 arrived at Gongaga), there was nobody home.  However, now a blacksmith
 can be found in the house.  He'll tell you about about the Keystone,
 which it turns out is in the possession of Dio, the owner of the Gold
 Saucer.  If you talk to him again and choose the third option ("Let's
 change the subject"), he'll ask for some Mythril.  If you got some
 from the sleeping man in Section O, then you can give it to him.  In
 return, he'll let you open one of the two boxes in his house.  If you
 open the big box that's in the southeast corner, near his bed, you'll
 get a Gold Armlet.  However, you can steal these for free from the
 Dragons in Mt. Nibel, so instead, go up the stairs and follow the
 walkway until you reach the northwest corner of the house.  There is
 a silver container built into the wall here.  If you examine it,
 you'll get the Great Gospel instead (which is far more valuable, as
 it's the only way Aeris can learn her final Limit Break).

 If, for some inconceivable reason you wanted to get both items (or
 get more than one Great Gospel manual), you could always return to the
 sleeping man by collecting the Buggy from Nibelheim, driving back to
 Costa del Sol, returning to Junon, and going across the river to the
 cave where the man is.  He'd then give you another piece of Mythril
 if you had the proper number of wins.

 Also, by examining the bed in the blacksmith's house, he'll let you
 sleep there for free.  Anyway, after getting the Great Gospel, get
 back into the Tiny Bronco.  If you go southeast, you'll find that the
 shallow water extends across a chain of islands to the east.  One of
 the larger islands has a forest on it, and in the forest, you can see
 a large temple.  This is the Temple of the Ancients, which you'll have
 to return to at a later point.  For now, go northeast around the large
 island.  You'll find that the sea runs inland.  Following it can be
 a little tricky (since it has a lot of curves), but eventually you'll
 come out on the underside of the eastern continent, near Fort Condor.

 As long as you're here, you can always go to Fort Condor to fight in
 another battle.  If you don't have many Tents, you may want to stock
 up on them.

 If you get back into the Tiny Bronco and continue east, you'll come
 across a chain of three islands leading south.  Follow them, until
 you reach a slightly larger island with a shoreline.  If you park the
 Bronco at the shore and run around in the grassy area of the isle,
 you'll randomly encounter Head Hunters (they look like green insects).

 Beating the Head Hunters can be difficult (since they have 2000 HP and
 can do a good deal of physical damage), but I find that by using Trine
 twice (or Beta once, if your magic power is high enough) will do enough
 damage to defeat them.  What's more, you get tons of XP/AP/Gil from them
 (since they appear in groups of 3-4), and if you have your double-growth
 weapons and those Rune Armlets equipped, you can level up your materia
 in no time.  You'll be running out of magic often, though, so make sure
 you have a few Tents with you.

 You can also encounter Sea Worms by the shore--they're not that great
 in terms of earning points, but you can steal Dragon Scales off of them,
 which will come in handy later on.

 Once you've had your fun here, it's time to either go to Wutai (see
 the next section), or go back to the Gold Saucer (see Section W).  Since
 you've already been near both areas previously, you should be able to
 get back to them without any problems.

 (U)  Wutai (without Yuffie)
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Magic Shuriken, Hairpin, Dragoon Lance.

 Items to steal:
  - Adaman Bangle (from Adamantaimai)

 Enemy Skills in this section:
  - Magic Hammer (from Razor Weed), Death Force (from Adamantaimai).
  
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Please take note:

 This section is written for those of you who haven't gotten Yuffie yet.
 Once you have, read section W, omitting the events that you've already
 done in this section.  Furthermore:

  - The events that take place in Wutai change depending on several
    factors.  The first one is whether or not Yuffie has joined you
    (even if she's not in your current party).
  - If Yuffie has joined you, the second factor is what disc you are on.
    Once you reach Disc 3, the only event that you can participate in
    that involves Yuffie is the 'Pagoda of Five Mighty Gods' sequence
    (see Section V for details).
  - Therefore, while visiting Wutai is optional, you can get the most
    out of your trip by getting Yuffie to join you, then visiting Wutai
    during Disc 1 or 2.
  - However, the sub-quest involving Yuffie can be difficult, so you may
    want to make sure you have a backup save before coming here, in case
    you find that your characters are too weak. 
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 Park the Tiny Bronco at the shore at the south end of the easternmost
 continent.  If you run around on the shore, you can fight Adamantaimais
 (they look like gigantic turtles).  You can steal Adaman Bangles from
 them (which have an insanely high defense rating) and you can manipulate
 them to learn the "Death Force" Enemy Skill.  After getting it, go just
 to the south of the shore, where there is a grassy area.  Here, you can
 encounter Razor Weeds (they look like stalks of grass), which will teach
 you the "Magic Hammer" Enemy Skill (they can be manipulated, too).

 It's worth mentioning that most enemies in Wutai drop several types of
 items, and they do so frequently.  If you're short on money, you can
 fight monsters here to pick up all kinds of good stuff, like X-Potions,
 Phoenix Downs, etc.
                                   
 Anyway, follow the mountain path as it leads north.  After crossing the
 second bridge, go left.  Once you reach ground level, turn around and
 you'll see a path heading north between two mountain ranges.  After a
 while, you'll reach another bridge.  After crossing it, the land becomes
 grassy, and you should see a town off in the distance.

 Once you reach the town, go across the west bridge to reach a weapons
 store.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Wutai Weapon Shop
    Murasame               6500 gil     Weapon (for Cloud)
    Diamond Knuckle        5800 gil     Weapon (for Tifa)
    Chainsaw               6300 gil     Weapon (for Barret)
    Aurora Rod             5800 gil     Weapon (for Aeris)
    Gold Barrette          6000 gil     Weapon (for Red XIII)
    Slash Lance            6500 gil     Weapon (for Cid)
    Blue M-phone           5500 gil     Weapon (for Cait Sith)
    Razor Ring             6000 gil     Weapon (for Yuffie)
    Shortbarrel            6400 gil     Weapon (for Vincent)
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 Outside, go across the next bridge.  Here is the Turtle's Paradise pub,
 but since you haven't found all the flyers yet, there's no point in
 going here.  Instead, take the bridge north to reach a Save Point.
 Near it is an item shop.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Wutai Item Shop
    Hi-Potion               300 gil     Item
    Phoenix Down            300 gil     Item
    Ether                  1500 gil     Item
    Hyper                   100 gil     Item
    Tranquilizer            100 gil     Item
    Tent                    500 gil     Item
    Fire Veil               800 gil     Item
    Swift Bolt              800 gil     Item
    Choco Feather         10000 gil     Accessory
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 Although there is a treasure chest inside the shop, you can't get at it
 right now.  If you leave the shop and head northwest, you'll reach an
 area with a tall pagoda and to the east, a house.

 Inside the house, you can spend the night in the bedroom near the entry
 hall.  If you examine the wall scroll in the southwest corner, it will
 lift up, revealing a passage that leads to a chest.  Inside is the Magic
 Shuriken.  If you leave the bedroom and go east and then north to the
 second area of the house, you'll see an empty room with an odd looking
 east wall.  Go into the room and examine the cracks in the east wall to
 activate a hidden panel that leads to a secret passage.  If you go down
 the passage, you'll find a chest containing a Hairpin at the end.

 There's nothing left to do here, so leave the house and return to the
 Save Point back in town.  If you go northeast across the bridge here,
 you'll reach the Da-chao statues.

 Follow the path northwest until you reach a point where the path
 branches off to the north, then take the north path.  Follow it north
 as it leads behind the head of one of the Da-chao statues.  You'll
 arrive at a crossroads.  If you go north, there is a cave entrance
 on the west wall.  Inside, there is a chest containing a Dragoon Lance.
 There are pits of fire in this area that you cannot cross just yet,
 so you might as well leave.

 For now, this is all you can do in Wutai.  If you come back with Yuffie
 in your party, it's a different story.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (V)  Wutai (with Yuffie)
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Magic Shuriken, Hairpin, MP Absorb materia, Elixir x2, Swift Bolt,
    Dragoon Lance, Peace Ring, HP Absorb materia, X-Potion, Turbo Ether,
    Ice Ring, All Creation, Leviathan materia.

 Enemy Skills in this section:
  - Magic Hammer (from Razor Weed), Death Force (from Adamantaimai),
    Trine (from Godo).

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Please take note:

 This section is written for those of you who have Yuffie in your party.
 There's no point in reading section (U) if Yuffie's in your party and
 you haven't been here yet, as everything contained in (U) is also
 covered in this section.  Furthermore:

  - The events that take place in Wutai change depending on several
    factors.  The first one is whether or not Yuffie has joined you
    (even if she's not in your current party).
  - If Yuffie has joined you, the second factor is what disc you are on.
    Once you reach Disc 3, the only event that you can participate in
    that involves Yuffie is the 'Pagoda of Five Mighty Gods' sequence
    (see Section V for details).
  - Therefore, while visiting Wutai is optional, you can get the most
    out of your trip by getting Yuffie to join you, then visiting Wutai
    during Disc 1 or 2.
  - The sub-quest involving Yuffie can be difficult, so you may want to
    make sure you have a backup save before coming here, in case you
    find that your characters are too weak.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 Park the Tiny Bronco at the shore at the south end of the easternmost
 continent.  If you run around on the shore, you can fight Adamantaimais
 (they look like gigantic turtles).  You can steal Adaman Bangles from
 them (which have an insanely high defense rating) and you can manipulate
 them to learn the "Death Force" Enemy Skill.  After getting it, go just
 to the south of the shore, where there is a grassy area.  Here, you can
 encounter Razor Weeds (they look like stalks of grass), which will teach
 you the "Magic Hammer" Enemy Skill (they can be manipulated, too).

 Now head north.  As you're following the path up into the mountains,
 Yuffie will show up (or else confront you if she's already in your
 party).  You'll then have to fight two Shinra soldiers...but you'll
 notice that you've lost your materia!

 It turns out that Yuffie has stolen your materia.  She can take from
 between 48 and 50 materia, so if you have more than that, you'll still
 have some materia left to use.  What's more, she steals them in this
 order of preference:

        Master, Summon, Independent, Command, Support, Magic

 This means that unless you have a lot of materia, you'll probably only
 have a few Magic materia left, at best.  If you used GameShark codes
 to give yourself some of the "disabled" materia, then Yuffie will
 steal those and not give them back.

 You may think that you can get around your loss by simply going to a
 nearby town and buying some materia.  However, your characters will
 refuse to board any vehicle you're using (Tiny Bronco or the Highwind),
 and if you're riding a Chocobo, you can't use it to leave Wutai.

 It's worth mentioning that most enemies in Wutai drop several types of
 items, and they do so frequently.  If you're short on money, you can
 fight monsters here to pick up all kinds of good stuff, like X-Potions,
 Phoenix Downs, etc.  Since you've probably lost your Restore materia,
 earning X-Potions from the Bizzare Bugs (they look like yellow bugs
 with scorpion tails), may be a good idea, especially if your levels are
 low.

 There's nothing else to do but head north.  After crossing the second
 bridge, go left.  Once you reach ground level, turn around and you'll
 see a path heading north between two mountain ranges.  Eventually,
 you'll reach another bridge.  After crossing it, the land becomes
 grassy, and you should see a town off in the distance.
 
 Once you reach the town, you'll see Yuffie run off to the west.  From
 this point on, there are several events involving her that you can see.
 You don't have to do them in the order listed below (for example, you
 could skip the visit to Godo's house).

 Anyway, go into the building to the far west.  It turns out to be the
 Turtle's Paradise bar you've been hearing about.  You don't have all of
 their flyers yet, but don't worry about it, since the last one is here
 in Wutai.  You can also meet the Turks here, who are taking a vacation
 abroad.

 If you go north from the Turtle's Paradise bar, you'll see another
 building and a Save Point.  Ignore them for now and head northwest,
 following the path as it leads to a tall pagoda.  Once you reach the
 courtyard in front of the pagoda, enter the large house to the east.

 Inside the house, you can spend the night in the bedroom near the entry
 hall.  If you examine the wall scroll in the southwest corner, it will
 lift up, revealing a passage that leads to a chest.  Inside is the Magic
 Shuriken.  If you leave the bedroom and go east and then north to the
 second area of the house, you'll see an empty room with an odd looking
 east wall.  Go into the room and examine the cracks in the east wall to
 activate a hidden panel that leads to a secret passage.  If you go down
 the passage, you'll find a chest containing a Hairpin at the end.
 
 Now go back and talk to the man lying on the floor in the western room.
 After talking to him four times, Yuffie will show up.  You won't be able
 to catch her if you follow her, so just leave.

 Return to the town and enter the building near the Save Point.  It's
 an item shop.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Wutai Item Shop
    Hi-Potion               300 gil     Item
    Phoenix Down            300 gil     Item
    Ether                  1500 gil     Item

    Swift Bolt              800 gil     Item
    Choco Feather         10000 gil     Accessory
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 If you came here earlier, there was a woman standing in the way of a
 chest in the northeast corner of the room.  However, now she will have
 moved away.  If you open the chest, you'll find an MP Absorb materia,
 but then Yuffie will steal it.  Don't worry about it--you can get it
 back later on.

 Now return to the town entrance, and enter the house to the east of
 the entrance.  If you examine the folding screen in the northwest
 corner, it will slide back to reveal Yuffie.  After she leaves, return
 to the Turtle's Paradise bar.  There is a stone pot sitting outside
 the bar, in the northwest corner.  If you look at it, you'll see that
 it's wiggling.  Examine it, then punch it three times using the Circle
 button, and Yuffie will jump out.

 At Yuffie's house, follow her down the stairs.  If you examine the
 scroll on the wall to the east of the doorway, you'll discover the
 sixth and last Turtle's Paradise flyer.  Now go inside and talk
 to Yuffie.  She'll tell you to flip the left lever.  Go up to the
 levers on the north wall and flip one of them.  No matter which one
 you choose, your party will be trapped in a steel cage.  After she
 leaves, flip the lever again to free your friends.

 Now, go outside.  Don't bother trying to get your prize from Turtle's
 Paradise, since they won't give it to you yet.  Before you continue,
 you may want to stop by the Materia shop if you feel your party is too
 weak.  You can stock up on Fire Veils and Swift Bolts there, which
 will come in handy later on.  Make sure you have plenty of Phoenix
 Downs and Hi-Potions as well.

 Now go back to the pagoda which lies northwest of the town.  If you look
 to your left, you'll see that the doorway to the temple has been opened.
 Go up to the bell and examine it to have Cloud ring it.  Doing so will
 make a door appear on the southern wall of the temple.  Go inside and
 you'll run into an old adversary, Don Corneo.  After he runs off, open
 up the two chests in the room to get an Elixir and a Swift Bolt.  Then
 go up the stairs.

 Here, you'll have to fight more Shinra soldiers.  After killing them,
 go outside and talk to Reno.  The Turks will then run off.  Return to
 the Save Point in Wutai and head northeast to reach the Da-chao statues.
 Here, you'll fight most of your enemies in groups.  However, if you have
 some Swift Bolts or Fire Veils, you can make short work of them.

 After talking the the Turks, follow the path northwest until you reach a
 point where the path branches off to the north, then take the north
 path.  Follow it north as it leads behind the head of one of the Da-chao
 statues.  You'll arrive at a crossroads.  If you go north, there is a
 cave entrance on the west wall.  Talk to Rude to get him to move out of
 the way, then go insde.  In here, there is a chest containing a Dragoon
 Lance. There are pits of fire in this area that you cannot cross just
 yet, so you might as well leave.

 Outside, take the path south, and you'll run into Don Corneo.  Needless
 to say, a boss battle is not far behind.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Rapps

                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Wutai (Da-chao Statue)

 If you were lucky enough to have a spare Enemy Skill materia or Gravity
 materia after Yuffie stole your items, you can use "Laser" or any of
 the "Demi" spells to inflict a lot of damage.  You can also use "Slow"
 or "Stop" to make the fight even easier.

 Otherwise, you're pretty much restricted to physical attacks.  Items
 that cast spells aren't really that useful, although if you got some
 Dragon Scales from the Sea Worms back in Mideel, you can use those to
 do 700-800 damage per use.

 The only thing you really have to worry about when fighting Rapps is
 it's Aero3 attack, which does a huge amount of damage.  Make sure you
 have some Phoenix Downs and X-Potions on hand to keep your characters
 alive.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 After the battle is over, Yuffie will give you back all the materia she
 stole (plus the "MP Absorb" materia).  If you don't have any materia,
 she'll mess up the placement as she re-equips you.  If you do, then
 those materia stay undisturbed.  Either way, you can always unequip
 and rearrange your materia in any way you like.  You'll then find
 yourself out on the World Map.

 At this point, Yuffie's sub-quest is over.  There are still some events
 you can do in Wutai, but you can do them on any disc and at any time.
 If you want to do them now, though, then keep reading.

 First of all, if you haven't gotten the "Magic Hammer" Enemy Skill yet,
 you'll need it.  You can learn it from the Razor Weeds (they look like
 little weeds), that are found in the Da-chao statue area.  Or, you can
 find them on the World Map in any grassy area.

 Now go back to Wutai.  If you go north from the entrance, you'll see a
 small house between a river and a flight of stairs.  If you go inside,
 you'll see that it's full of cats.  If you work your way to the back
 of the room, you can climb up the stacked cabinets to reach an attic.
 Run forward, and the view will change to that of a hallway containing
 a chest.  Inside is the HP Absorb materia.  Now just go back the way
 you came and go outside.

 If you go to the weapon store (it's the building to the west of the
 entrance, before the Turtle's Paradise bar), you'll find that they
 will now sell you some weapons.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Wutai Weapon Shop
    Murasame               6500 gil     Weapon (for Cloud)

    Shortbarrel            6400 gil     Weapon (for Vincent)
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 I recommend at least picking up the Razor Ring for Yuffie.

 Now, go to the Turtle's Paradise bar.  If you found all of the flyers,
 you can get one of each "Source" item, as well as a Megalixir.

 Now, go back to the courtyard in the northwest corner of town.  If you
 enter the Pagoda of the Five Mighty Gods, you'll find that Yuffie will
 be able to fight with the person on each floor.  Don't worry if Yuffie
 gets killed; the game won't actually end.  Don't forget to stick her
 in the back row, since she can attack from there with no penalties.

 The boss of the first floor is Gorky.  Talk to him and pick the top
 option in order to fight him.

                Ability:    [Attack], Barrier, Reflect, Regen, Demi2
                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Godo's Pagoda

 Since Gorky's life is so low, you can kill him in a few rounds using
 Beta or Aqualung (Trine also works, though not as well).  If Gorky
 casts "Reflect" on himself, then don't use Aqualung (as it can be
 reflected).

 Otherwise, fighting Gorky can be challenging.  For one thing, he casts
 a number of beneficial spells on himself.  You can prevent him from
 doing so by using "Magic Hammer" on him until he runs out of MP.
 Another option is to cast "Reflect" on him, which will make his spells
 bounce onto you.  If you don't know Reflect, you can always use a
 Mirror, which has the same effect (they are dropped by the Mirage
 enemies found in the Mansion at Nibelheim).

 Gorky's main threat is his physical attack.  Since you can't use Barrier
 or Big Guard to lessen the damage it inflicts, you need to know at least
 Cure2, or else have some X-Potions on hand.  If you use the "Reflect"
 tactic described above, then Gorky will probably end up casting Regene
 on you, which helps somewhat.  On the other hand, since his attack does
 a good deal of damage, your Limit Break gauge will fill up in no time,
 which means you can really whomp him with your limit break of choice.

 I suggest pairing Elemental + Gravity on your armor to nullify Gorky's
 "Demi2" attack.  You can also pair Elemental + Choco/Mog on your weapon
 to do double damage, since Gorky is weak against Wind.  If you know
 Stop or Slow, try casting them on Gorky.  If you don't know those
 spells, pair Added Effect + Time on your weapon, and there's a small
 chance you'll inflict either status ailment with each attack you make.

 If your physical attacks aren't doing enough damage, then you can always
 try using Bio2 or Ice2 (assuming Gorky hasn't cast Reflect on himself).

 And yes, they mess up and call him "Gorkii" instead of Gorky; it's not
 a typo :)
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 After beating Gorky, you can fight Shake on the second floor by talking
 to him and picking the top option.  Remember, you can leave the pagoda
 to heal up and save at any time, so don't feel that you have to beat
 all the bosses in one go (though it makes for a good challenge).

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Shake
                LV: 32        XP:  2200      Steal:  <nothing>
                HP: 4000      AP:  50        Morph:  <cannot>
                MP: 180       Gil: 0         Leaves: Turbo Ether
                No Effect:  Gravity, *Invincibility, Sleep*
                Ability:    [Attack], Rage Bomber <causes Fury>
                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Godo's Pagoda
                Notes:      Uses the Rage Bomber whenever attacked.

 You can do major damage against Shake by using L4 Suicide on him.  If
 you don't know that Enemy Skill, then you can always use Aqualung or
 Beta, which do a lot of damage (Trine isn't as effective).

 Without those abilities, this battle gets tricky.  Not only does Shake
 attack you each round, but he uses his "Rage Bomber" whenever you do
 anything to him (attack, use a spell or Enemy Skill, etc.)  The real
 problem with the Rage Bomber is that it can cause the Fury status,
 which means you take double damage from attacks.  This can be used to
 your advantage (as your Limit Break gauge will max out quickly), but
 if your life is too low, I recommend wearing the Peace Ring that you
 just got from Rapps.  That way, your status won't change.

 Even with protection from the Fury status, you'll still need to know
 Cure2 (or have some X-Potions on hand) in order to keep your life up.
 Don't forget to cast Barrier or Big Guard on yourself.

 Against Shake, try using Stop or Slow on him.  If you don't know either
 of those abilities, equip Added Effect + Time on your weapon and with
 any luck, a successful hit will afflict him with a status ailment.  If
 your physical attacks are too weak, you can always use Bio2 (which may
 poison him), or Ice2.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 After beating Shake, go up the stairs.  You can fight Chekhov by talking
 to him and picking the top option.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Chekhov
                LV: 34        XP:  2900      Steal:  <nothing>
                HP: 5000      AP:  50        Morph:  <nothing>
                MP: 210       Gil: 0         Leaves: Ice Ring
                No Effect:  Gravity, *Invincibility, Sleep*
                Ability:    Stare Down <causes Stop>,
                            Absorb <absorbs HP>
                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Godo's Pagoda

 Since Chekhov's "Stare Down" costs MP, you can use Magic Hammer until
 he has no MP, and he'll spend the rest of the battle trying to use it
 even though nothing happens.  His only other attack (Absorb) is nothing
 to worry about.

 If you don't have Magic Hammer, you can always use "Slow" or "Stop" on
 Chekhov (or pair Time + Added Effect on your weapon).  Then use Beta or
 Aqualung until he dies.  Trine also works (though not as well).  If you
 don't know any of those Enemy Skills, then use Bio2 to poison Chekhov
 (other attack spells, like Ice2, Bolt2, etc. do around the same amount
 of damage).
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 After winning, go to the fourth floor and talk to Staniv, then pick the
 top option to fight him.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Staniv
                LV: 36        XP:  3600      Steal:  <nothing>
                HP: 6000      AP:  50        Morph:  <cannot>
                MP: 240       Gil: 0         Leaves: Elixir
                No Effect:  *Gravity, Invincibility, Sleep*
                Ability:    [Attack], War Cry <causes Sadness>,
                            Iron Attack
                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Godo's Pagoda

 Like Shake, you can use L4 Suicide on Staniv to inflict major damage.
 If you don't have that ability, you can always use Aqualung or Beta to
 do lots of damage (Trine isn't as effective).  If you don't know those
 spells, Quake2 and Bio2 work well (and Bio2 can poison Staniv).

 As with the other bosses in the pagoda, you can use Stop or Slow on
 Staniv, or you can equip Added Effect + Time on your weapon and keep
 attacking until one of those ailments takes effect.

 Finally, since all of Staniv's attacks are physical in nature, cast
 Barrier or Big Guard on yourself to lessen the damage.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 Once Staniv is defeated, go to the top floor and talk to Godo to fight
 him.  However, you may want to put this off.  Why?  You'll be getting
 two more Enemy Skill materia before the game is over, and Godo ends up
 being the only character who can use "Trine" on you in the later discs.
 If you kill him before getting all four Enemy Skill materia, you'll
 never be able to learn "Trine" for all of them.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Godo
                LV: 41        XP:  5000      Steal:  <nothing>
                HP: 10000     AP:  60        Morph:  <cannot>
                MP: 1000      Gil: 40000     Leaves: All Creation
                No Effect:  *Paralysis, Stop, Invincibility, Sleep*
                Ability:    Drain <absorbs HP>,
                            [Shrivel] <casts "Mini">,
                            Beast Sword, Trine, Sleepel, Cure3, Demi3
                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Godo's Pagoda

 Godo's main asset is Cure3, which he casts on himself whenever his life
 drops too low.  Unless you're able to do more than 1200 points of damage
 per round, you're going to have to find some way around this.  There are
 several methods you can use.  One is to cast Reflect on Godo.  This way,
 his Cure3 spell will bounce onto you.  You can also use Mirrors (which
 are dropped by the Mirage enemies found in the Mansion at Nibelheim),
 for the same effect.  You need to periodically re-apply "Reflect",
 though, since it doesn't last forever.  You can also cast "Reflect" on
 yourself to bounce Godo's attack spells back at him (except Demi3).

 Another method is to spend ten rounds using "Magic Hammer" on him.  Once
 you've done this, he'll have no MP left.  The final method is to simply
 stay alive long enough for him to run out of MP.  This takes practically
 forever, though.

 Godo has a variety of attacks, all of which can be defended against in
 one manner or another.  I recommend wearing a Bolt Ring to nullify his
 Trine attack, or try pairing Lighting + Elemental on your armor for the
 same effect.  Even if you don't have a Bolt Ring, you should have two
 Elemental materia by now, so pair the second Elemental materia with
 Gravity, and you will nullify his "Demi3" attack.  His "status ailment"
 attacks are nothing to worry about, since you can use White Wind to
 instantly cure any of them.  Finally, you can use Barrier or Big Guard
 to lessen the damage that his "Beast Sword" inflicts.

 As for attacking Godo, start by casting Slow on him (or pair Time +
 Added Effect on your weapon).  You can use Laser or any of the Demi
 spells to inflict massive damage at first, then polish him off with
 Aqualung or Beta once his HPs are low enough (Trine can also be used,
 though it's not as effective).
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 After defeating Godo, you'll receive the Leviathan materia.  If you
 talk to Shake before you leave, he says something about Materia being
 found in an underground pipe.  The way he says it makes it unclear,
 but I think he's actually talking about getting the Guide Book from
 the "Ghost Ship" enemy found in a tunnel leading to the Underwater
 Reactor (you'll be going there way later on).  It's the only pipe-like
 structure I can think of that is found below the planet's surface,
 and you can use the Guide Book to get the "Underwater Materia" later
 on.  Just some conjecture on my part.

 Well, now you've done just about all there is to do in Wutai, at least
 for now.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (W)  Return to the Gold Saucer
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Keystone (a Key Item), Protect Vest, Choco Feather, Elixir.
                         
 If you know how to get to the Gold Saucer from your current location,
 then do so.  If you're at the south end of Wutai and want to get there,
 then follow these instructions:

 If you head east, following the shallow waters back to the midwest
 continent, you should see a river between Nibelheim and Cosmo Canyon.
 If you follow it, you'll come out in an area which has the Gold Saucer
 to the west, and a lone house on a peninsula to the right (this is the
 blacksmith's house).  If you look on the west bank, you should see some
 Chocobo tracks near the shore.  Disembark and make sure you have your
 Chocobo Lure materia equipped, then run around on the tracks until you
 encounter a Chocobo and catch it.

 If you forgot how to catch a Chocobo, just remember that you need to
 kill the enemies accompanying the Chocobo as quickly as possible, and
 without injuring the Chocobo itself.  You can use some Greens to keep
 a Chocobo occupied, but you should be strong enough to beat a monster
 in only a round or two.

 Now that you have one, it's off to North Corel, which is northwest of
 your current location.  Just circle around the Corel Desert and make
 your way along the mountain valley to where the town is.  Inside the
 town, head to the west and take the trolley up to the Golden Saucer.

 At the Saucer, go to the Battle Square.  Go up the stairs into the
 lobby, then head east into "Dio's Show Room."  Before continuing,
 you might as well know that Cloud is about to go fight in the Battle
 Arena.  Therefore, you might want to take a few moments to give him
 the proper equipment and materia, etc.

 I recommend putting him in the back row and giving him the Long Range,
 Counter Attack, and Enemy Skill materias.  Pairing Added Effect + Time
 on your weapon is also a good idea.  
                                     
 When you're ready, examine the Keystone (it looks like a green orb)
 lying atop a pedestal in the middle of the room.  Dio will then show
 up and ask you to entertain him.  Pick the top option, ("What'd you
 want me to do?"), and Cloud will automatically participate in the
 Battle Arena.

 If you've already fought in the Battle Arena, then you'll have no
 trouble here.  If not, here's a quick explanation:

 In the battle area, you basically go through one protracted battle
 fighting several sets of monsters.  Because the battle doesn't really
 end until you defeat all the monsters (or die), your current HP and MP
 amount, as any status ailments, etc., are carried over to the next
 match.

 What's more, between rounds, there is a sort of "slot machine" that you
 can stop by pressing the Circle button.  The result of the slot machine
 will affect your character in a certain way.  For example, if you get
 the Green Materia icon, then all your magic materia are disabled for
 the remainder of the battle.  This makes each subsequent battle harder
 than the last, as the penalties keep piling up after each fight.
    
 Note that you can choose to quit the battle by choosing the righthand
 option ("No, way!") between battles.  Even if you lose (or quit) after
 the very first battle, Dio will give you the Keystone.  However, if you
 manage to make it through all eight battles, he will give you a Protect
 Vest and a Choco Feather.

 After getting the Keystone, return to the Station Square and go out to
 where the trolley is.  If you talk to the person standing near it,
 they'll explain that it's broken.  Your teammates will then meet up at
 the Ghost Hotel.  In a cheesy attempt to fill in any plot holes, you
 can then have Cloud explain to everyone else what's gone on so far
 (pick the bottom option), or not (pick the top option).

 Afterwards, Cloud will be able to go on a date with a certain character
 (Aeris, Tifa, Yuffie, or Barret).  Who shows up depends on how many
 "love points" you've acquired up to this time.  You can't tell how many
 love points you have, but how you responded to certain events, etc.,
 determines who gains or loses love points.  The person with the highest
 total then becomes Cloud's date.

 Aeris is the most likely candidate for the date sequence, followed by
 Tifa, then Yuffie, and finally, Barret.  For more information on this
 topic, I suggest you go to GameFAQs (http://www.gamefaqs.com), and look
 under their section on FF7 FAQs for Terence Furguson's "Dating Guide."
 This explains exactly how your actions determine who you end up dating.

 Anyway, the date begins with the two of you winning the lead roles in
 a play taking place at the Event Square.  There are several ways you
 can act during the play, resulting in various funny endings :)

 Afterwards, you'll take a ride in the gondola.  While inside of it, you
 can use the control pad and buttons to make Cloud move around.  Pressing
 forward will make him look out the window, which you can do at various
 points to see little FMV clips of various places within the Gold Saucer.

 After the ride, the two of you will run into Cait Sith, who makes off
 with the Keystone.  You can follow him and chase him around the Gold
 Saucer, but if you just want to get this scene over with, go to the
 Chocobo Square and go inside.  Chase Cait around, then follow him back
 outside.

 Once you're back in your hotel room, check out the iron maiden in the
 northeast corner of the room to find an Elixir.  Then exit the room and
 go down to the ground floor.  Here, you'll have to make a new party.
 Once you've done so, go outside and go down to the grave with the word
 "Station" written on it.  Examine it to return to the Station Square.

 If you go outside, you'll find that the trolley has now been fixed, and
 you can return to North Corel.  From there, go outside and return to
 where you parked the Tiny Bronco (it's southeast of your location).

 Now, it's time to go to the Temple of the Ancients.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (X)  The Temple of the Ancients
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Trident, Mind Source, Silver Rifle, Turbo Ether x2, Rocket Punch,
    Luck Plus materia, Morph materia, Princess Guard, Ribbon,
    Trumpet Shell, Megalixir, Nail Bat, Work Glove, Dragon Armlet,
    Bahamut materia, Gigas Armlet.

 Items to morph:
  - Mind Source x2 (from the "8 eye" monsters)

 From your current location (southeast of the Gold Saucer), get into the
 Tiny Bronco and follow the shallow waters south, then east, along a
 chain of islands.  You'll come across a larger one with a forest on
 it, and emerging from the treetops is a temple.  This is your current
 goal.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Before continuing on, take note that Aeris will leave your party after
 completing this section.  Therefore, if there was anything else you
 wanted to do with her, you may want to either do it now, or make a spare
 save file so you can go back and do it later on.

 Also, you cannot change your party while in the Temple.  Therefore, make
 sure you're content with whoever you decide to put in your party aside
 from Cloud and Aeris.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 At the temple, cross the bridge and examine the man in the black cloak
 at the top of the stairs.  Inside, examine the dais and Cloud will put
 the Keystone in.  You'll end up in a large labyrinth-like area.  Go
 along the path, then follow it around to the set of stairs leading down.
 Just east of the stairs is an archway; it leads to a wall, but there is
 some ivy here that you can climb down.  If you run east under the set
 of stairs, you'll reach a treasure chest containing a Trident.

 Now go east, down the stairs.  There is a wall here with some ivy on
 it, so climb up the ivy.  Ignore the doorway for now and go west, up
 the stairs.  Don't worry about the purple guy running around for now.
 If you climb up the ivy on the west wall, you can find a Mind Source
 lying near the stairs.  Go down the stairs and into the doorway that
 the purple guy ran into.  Inside, there is a chest in the northeast
 corner containing a Silver Rifle.  If you talk to the old man, you
 can buy items from him (the top option), get your HP and MP restored
 (pick the second option), save your game (the third option), or do
 nothing (the last option).

 If you choose to save your game, Cloud reminds you that you can't leave
 the Temple of Ancients for now.  If you still want to save, pick the
 bottom option.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 When you're ready, go outside.  Go back up the stairs, then climb down
 the ivy to the lower floor.  Here, you can go south to go through an
 archway.  There is a Turbo Ether lying on the ground here.  Now go
 down the long stairway, then west through the archway, south down the
 next set of stairs, and west and south again, until you reach the end
 of the path.  There's some ivy on the wall, so climb down it.  Nearby
 is a treasure chest which holds the Rocket Punch.  From here, go down
 the stairs, then head northeast to where there is another ivy-covered
 wall.  Climb up it and go up the stairs, ignoring the old guy for now.

 There is another archway here.  If you go through it, you'll reach a
 set of stairs that go down to the east.  At the bottom, theri s a tall
 ivy-covered wall.  Climb up it and head northwest, under the stairs, to
 where there is a pink ball lying on the ground.  It's a Luck Plus
 materia (which is incorrectly labeled "Lucky Plus" when you pick it up).

 Now go back to where you met the old man (the area with the short set
 of stairs and a patch of ivy south of it).  Take the path west through
 the archway, then go south and west again to reach a new area of the
 temple.  Here, there are C-shaped boulders rolling down the path.  You
 need to run forward and then pause so that you end up standing in the
 gap in each boulder.  Otherwise, you'll be pushed back to the start of
 the path.  Halfway along the path, you'll see a pool with a yellow
 materia lying by it.  It's a Morph materia.  After grabbing it,
 continue along the path.  Once you reach the end, the boulders will
 stop falling.

 Once you're in control of Cloud again, go back to the end of the path.
 The old man is here, waiting for you.  He'll recover your HP and MP if
 you pick the top option, and you can save with the second option.  If
 you don't want any help, pick the bottom option.

 In the next area is the Time Guardian, a gigantic clock.  There are
 twelve passages in this room that you can get to by moving the clock
 hands around, then running across them.

 You can make the hands spin automatically by pressing the Circle
 button, then press it again to make them stop.  However, the hands
 will actually move three more times before coming to a stop.  If
 you find this too disorienting, you can always use the manual method
 (described below).  Otherwise, this is the fastest way to move the
 hands around.

 To move the hands yourself, press the Triangle button.  You can then
 use the Triangle and Circle buttons to move the minute hand around.
 Every time you move it past 12 (the northernmost passage), the hour
 hand will go forward by one count (and if you go counter-clockwise,
 the hour hand will go backwards by one count).

 When you're ready to go on, press the X button.  You can then run
 across the hands into one of the other chambers.  If you messed up,
 you can always leave the room and come back.  Also, take note of the
 second hand--if it touches you while you're running across the clock's
 surface, you'll fall down.

 Here's a list of what you can find at each location:

  I    - This leads to a treasure chest.  If you open it, you'll be
         attacked by two Toxic Frogs and a Jemnezmy.  You can kill
         them all in one round with "Trine", or else try using
         "L4 Suicide" against the Jemnezmy, then Ice2 or Shiva on
         the Toxic Frogs.

  II   - This leads to a blocked path.

  III  - This leads to a treasure chest.  If you open it, you'll be
         attacked by two "8 eye" monsters.  They can do a lot of damage,
         but you can kill them instantly with Bio.  On the other hand,
         you can Morph them into Magic Sources, if you get their life low
         enough.

  IIII - This leads to a chest containing the Princess Guard.

  V    - This takes you back to the first area of the Temple.  You can
         now get at that unreachable treasure chest, which contains a
         Ribbon.

  VI   - This leads outside to the next area of the Temple.  You may
         want to go to the other rooms first before continuing on.

  VII  - This leads to a chest containing the Trumpet Shell.

  VIII - This leads to a chest containing a Megalixir.

  IX   - Another blocked passage.

  X    - This is where you came from.  You can always come back here
         if you want to heal up or save your game, though.

  XI   - Another blocked passage.

  XII  - There's nothing to do in this room for now.  You'll be coming
         back later on.

 If you get knocked off the clock face by the second hand, you'll fall
 down to a new area with a chest.  Before you can open it, however, you
 have to fight two monsters.

                Ability:    [Southern Cross]
                Manipulate: Horn, Southern Cross
                Location:   Temple of the Ancients / Battle Square

 You always end up getting attacked from both sides in this battle.  This
 can be a problem, as the Ancient Dragons do a fair amount of damage.  To
 put one of them out of comission, just Manipulate it.  Then finish off
 the other one quickly by using the "Laser" enemy skill, or Demi2.  Now
 you can polish off the last one with spells, to prevent the "Manipulate"
 effect from ending.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 If you open up the chest after killing the Ancient Dragons, you'll find
 a Nail Bat.  Once you exit the room via the south opening, you'll find
 yourself way back at the start of the labyrinthine area inside the
 Temple.  If you were badly damaged in battle, you can always return
 to the first area where you met the old man, as he will still be there.
 Otherwise, just make your way back to the Time Guardian puzzle.

 Remember, since the clock puzzle will "freeze" after you get through the
 next area, make sure you go to all the rooms you want to first before
 continuing on through passage VI.

 In the next area, the old man will lock the main door and then run off.
 Aeris will ask you a question, but it doesn't matter how you respond.
 What you have to do is catch the old man.  You can go through the holes
 in the wall to move to other areas, and if you go to the far left of
 each ledge, you can jump down to the lower level by pressing the Circle
 button.

 To understand how the passages are connected, take a look at this
 diagram:

     A1 = B3                                          A2 = Clock
     B1 = C2         B2 = C4         B3 = B1          B4 = C1
     C1 = B2         C2 = C3         C3 = B4          C4 = A1

 This shows where each passage leads.  Since the old man's first
 move is to always go into passage A1 (the first passage from the
 left on the topmost ledge), you can catch him by going  into
 passage B3 (it's on the second ledge, third opening from
 the left).

 After catching the old man, you can rest by picking the top option,
 or save your game by picking the second option.  If you don't want
 either of his services, pick the bottom option.  Before you go back
 up to where the door is, be sure to open the treasure chest on the
 bottomost ledge, in the lefthand corner.  It contains the Work Glove.

 If you don't know how to get back up to the topmost ledge, just
 go through the 4th passage from the left on the lowest ledge.

 Once you go through the door, head to the east.  After Sephiroth
 leaves, you'll have to fight a boss.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Red Dragon
                LV: 39        XP:  3500      Steal:  <nothing>
                HP: 6800      AP:  200       Morph:  <cannot>
                MP: 300       Gil: 1000      Leaves: Dragon Armlet
                Absorbs:    Fire
                No Effect:  *Gravity, Stop, Invincibility, Confuse,
                            Sleep*
                Ability:    [Bite], [Tail Slap], Red Dragon Breath
                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   The Temple of Ancients

 You can wear a Fire Ring or pair Elemental + Fire/Ifrit on your armor
 to prevent the boss' Red Dragon Breath from doing any damage (and at
 this point, you should be able to protect everybody from the RDB using
 the appropriate item or materia).  If you don't have the materia to
 do this, then cast Big Guard or MBarrier on yourself, since the RDB
 is magical in nature.

 Since the boss can do a lot of damage with it's attacks, I recommend
 casting Big Guard or Barrier + All on yourselves.  Then use Cure2 + All
 or White Wind to keep your HP up.
 
 As for attacking the Red Dragon, start off by casting Slow on it.  You
 can also poison it using Bio2.  You can do the most damage with Enemy
 Skills like Aqualung or Trine...if you don't know those, stick with
 Bio2, Quake2, and physical attacks.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 Once the Red Dragon is dead, pick up the floating red orb to get the
 Bahamut materia.  Then return to the east end of the hall.  There is
 a miniature version of the temple floating in mid-air.  If you examine
 it, you'll be given three options.  No matter which one you choose,
 you'll get the same result.  If Cait Sith isn't in your party, he'll
 call you and suggest a way to remove the Black Materia from the temple
 (if he's in your party already, he suggests the same thing).  Since you
 have no choice in the matter, just pick the top option.

 Once you're in control of Cloud, run to the west end of the hallway
 and leave.  Outside, you can rest or save your game by talking to
 the old man (I recommend that you do both).
                                 
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Before you continue, note that whatever weapon and armor Aeris is
 wearing will be lost after this section is complete.  Therefore, you
 may want to make sure she's not wearing a rare item (like the Edincoat,
 which you can't buy more of until later on in the game).  However, any
 accessory she has equipped will be returned to you, so don't worry about
 that.

 Also, if she has any disabled materia equipped (via a GameShark code),
 those will be lost as well.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 Now return to the clock puzzle.  The hands have stopped, so your only
 option is to head north into passage XII.  In here, walk up to the door,
 and your party will be attacked.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Demon's Gate
                LV: 45        XP:  3800      Steal:  <cannot>
                HP: 10000     AP:  220       Morph:  <cannot>
                MP: 400       Gil: 4000      Leaves: Gigas Armlet
                No Effect:  Poison, Gravity, *Stop, Paralysis, Sleep*
                Resists:    Earth
                Ability:    [Rock Fall], Cave-in, Demon Rush
                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Temple of the Ancients

 The Demon's Gate is one of the more difficult bosses you will encounter.
 For one thing, attack spells do little damage to him, which means you
 have to rely on physical attacks.  However, since you've already gotten
 some good weapons in this level (like the Nail Bat), you can still do a
 fair amount of damage to him.  If any of your characters can use long-
 range weapons, make sure they're in the back row.  Otherwise, give
 someone the Long Range materia, so they can fight without penalty from
 the back row.
 
 Start off by casting Big Guard on your party, or else Barrier + All
 followed by Haste + All.  All of the bosses' attacks are physical in
 nature, and they do a ton of damage, so make sure you have "Barrier"
 or some equivalent in effect at all times.  If you find that you're
 still taking too much damage, make sure that you have some Adaman
 Bangles equipped (you could steal them from the Adamantaimais on the
 Wutai shoreline).  Or, use Tranquilizers on your characters to give
 them the Sadness status ailment (which makes it harder to fill up
 your Limit Gauge but also reduces the amount of damage you take).

 As for going after the boss, there's not much else you can do aside
 from casting Slow on it, then using Bahamut (as it's the only summon
 that does any substantial damage to him).  Afterwards, keep using
 physical attacks and Limit Breaks (since they will be filling up pretty
 quickly as you take damage).  If Aeris has learned "Planet Protector"
 or "Great Gospel," it will make this battle much easier.  Tifa can also
 make short work of the boss using her multi-part Limit Break.

 If Vincent's in your party, give him the Sniper CR and the Deathblow
 materia, even though the Sniper CR isn't as powerful as some of his
 other guns.  Since it gives him a 255% attack rate, though, you can
 use 'Deathblow' repeatedly and it will always hit.

 As for healing, use White Wind or Cure2 + All to keep your life as high
 as possible.  If someone dies, revive them, then recast Big Guard (or
 use Barrier and Haste on them).
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 After killing the boss, you'll eventually find yourself controlling a
 young version of Cloud while the other one is moving around.  There's
 nothing you can do to prevent what follows from occurring, so don't
 worry about it.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (Y)  Bone Village / Corral Valley
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Lunar Harp (a Key Item), Buntline, Megalixir, Mop, Kjata materia
    (if you didn't get it earlier).

 Enemy Skills in this section:
  - Death Sentence (from Boundfat).

 After you wake up, you can give any answer you like to Barret and Tifa.
 Once you leave the house you're in, you'll find that you're back at
 Gongaga village.  If you go back to the World Map, you'll see that the
 Tiny Bronco is parked just south of here, by the shore.

 If you check your inventory, you'll see that whatever accessory Aeris
 was wearing (as well as any Materia she had equipped) have been put
 back into your item list.  However, her currently-equipped weapon, as
 well as any armor she was wearing, is gone for good.  Hopefully, you
 didn't leave her equipped with a rare piece of equipment.

 If you've already been to Bone Village, well, that's where you need to
 go next.  If you haven't been there yet, then follow these directions:

 Head east along the coastline, then follow it north.  You should see
 the weaponsmith's house and the Gold Saucer.  There is a river between
 them that goes east, so follow it.  You'll come out between Nibelheim
 and Cosmo Canyon.  Now just follow the shallow waters north, as they
 lead your past Rocket Town and curve northeast along the north end of
 the continent.  Eventually, you'll reach a place where the shallow
 waters extend up to the bottom of the northern continent, and you'll
 see a shoreline with a forest just to the north of it.  In the forest
 are some large dinosaur bones.  This is where you need to go.

 If you touch the bones, you'll find yourself in a little place called
 Bone Village.  Remember the forest where you saw Aeris?  It's just
 north of here, but in order to get through the forest, you need to get
 an item called the Lunar Harp.  It's buried somewhere beneath the
 village, but luckily for you, the place is home to a bunch of
 archaeologists who are more than happy to find it for you...for a price.

 Start off by talking to the man who is just west of the entrance.
 You can pick the top option to have his men dig for you, or you can
 choose the second option to buy some items.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Bone Village Item Shop
    Diamond Bangle         3200 gil     Armor
    Rune Armlet            3700 gil     Armor
    Potion                   50 gil     Item
    Hi-Potion               300 gil     Item
    Phoenix Down            300 gil     Item
    Ether                  1500 gil     Item
    Hyper                   100 gil     Item
    Tranquilizer            100 gil     Item
    Tent                    500 gil     Item
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 If you haven't already gotten some Rune Armlets, I'd recommend that you
 get at least three of them.  Since they have a double AP growth, they
 can really come in handy if you want to master your materia.

 Now it's time to get the Lunar Harp.  Talk to the man west of the
 entrance and pick the first option.  He'll then ask you what kind of
 treasure you want him to look for.  You can still find the Lunar
 Harp regardless of which option you choose, but it's easiest if you
 simply pick the first option ("Lunar Harp").

 Now you have to place the man's assistants throughout the village.
 The idea here is that when you set off an explosive later on, the
 men will turn towards the direction of the treasure.  Therefore,
 you want to arrange the men so that they are all staring towards
 a common point, as this will help you decide where to dig.  You can
 set people both on the lower and upper level of Bone Village.  Keep
 in mind that you can't walk through the assistants you place, so
 make sure to not obstruct ladders or pathways with them, or you
 may not be able to get to the spot where you want to dig.

 It costs 100 gil to place someone, so if you don't have enough money,
 you'll have to see if you can still find the Lunar Harp with only a
 few people to help you.  The maximum number of people you can place at
 any time is five.  After placing enough people, choose the bottom option
 to quit (this will happen automatically if you place five people).  Then
 press the Square button, and an explosive will be set off.  The diggers
 will then turn in the direction of the treasure.  Decide where you want
 to dig, and press the Square button.

 In the PlayStation version of FF7, the Lunar Harp is located on the
 upper level, a little to the west of the the southwest corner of the
 tent.  It's in a different location in the PC version (which I haven't
 played), so please don't ask about it ;)  The next day, you can check
 the treasure chest next to the head archaeologist to see if they found
 what you were looking for.  If they didn't, you can always try again.

 You can also dig up other treasures by using the other options.  For
 example, if you choose to dig for good treasure, you can find the
 following:
    
    Buntline
  - This can be found on the upper level of Bone Village, to the east
    of the tallest ladder (the one you used to get to the upper level.)
    If you assume that the area east of the ladder is shaped almost like
    a circle, then the Buntline is found in the bright spot near the
    middle of the circle.

    Megalixir
  - This is just east of the lead archaeologist (the guy in the
    southwest corner), against the ribcage of the dinosaur.

    Mop
  - This is just to the east of where you got the Megalixir, and ever
    so slightly south of that point (closer to the jet debris).
 
 Remember that which item the staff will look at is random, so you may
 want to place them throughout the village so you can identify what point
 they are looking at.  Hopefully that will help you determine which item
 they're looking for.

 It seems as if these are the only "good treasure" items available.  If
 you try to dig for more, the staff will continue to look at the areas
 where the above three items are located.

 Once you have the Lunar Harp, you can head off to the Sleeping Forest
 by going up to the upper level and exiting through the opening in the
 northwest corner of the village.  In the first screen of the forest,
 just run forward.  Once you reach the second screen (it's in a sort
 of overhead view), the Lunar Harp will awaken the forest.  If you
 haven't gotten the Kjata materia yet, then stand around for a moment
 and watch the trees.  You should see a red orb floating around,
 disappearing and reappearing all around the screen.  If you try to
 grab it, you'll get the Kjata materia.

 After getting it, continue north to reach Corral Valley.  If you look
 to the east, you'll see that there's a path that leads to a hanging
 vine.  Above the vine is a path leading to a cave opening.  However,
 there seems to be no way to actually climb the vine.  I don't know why
 this is; perhaps Square was going to add in another area of the
 valley (admittedly, it's only two screens wide, which is pretty tiny),
 but for whatever reason, it's not accessible in the finished product.
 Strange.

 Anyway, in this area, head north and run underneath the hollow tree
 trunk to reach a chest containing a Water Ring.  Then go back to where
 the pink piece of coral is, and climb up the rocky steps to the west
 of it.  This way, you can run through the tree trunk.  Once you're past
 it, you can head north to reach the next area.

 Here, just follow the path.  It will take you outside to the World Map.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Before you continue, it's worth mentioning that you can earn a ton of AP
 from fighting the Boundfats and Malldancers in the first screen of the
 Corral Valley.  Although you earn more points from fighting the Head
 Hunters in Mideel, these enemies have only 1/4th the life of a Head
 Hunter, and they can be knocked out in one round by using Trine.  You
 can then go outside and use a Tent to restore your MP when it gets too
 low (or you can return to Bone Village, if you want to pick up some
 supplies as well).
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 When you're ready to continue, touch the cone-shaped building at the end
 of the valley to enter the Forgotten City.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (Z)  Forgotten City
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Magic Source, Aurora Armlet, Comet materia, Guard Source, Elixir,
    Enemy Skill materia, Wizard Bracelet.

 Enemy Skills in this section:
  - Aqualung (from Jenova*LIFE).

 If you head north, you'll reach a three-way junction.  Take the west
 path and follow it until you reach a building in the northwest corner
 of the screen.  Inside, there is a Save Point on the ground floor, and
 if you go up the stairs, there is a chest containing a Magic Source.
 There's a glowing stone beneath the second floor that you can examine,
 but since Cloud isn't an Ancient, there's not much of a point in doing
 this :)  You'll find these throughout this area, and they all have the
 same effect, so I won't mention them anymore.

 After leaving the building, follow the path east into a cave opening.
 Inside, go down the stairs and around the circular pathway until you
 arrive at a chest.  It contains an Aurora Armlet.  There's a large
 crystal in the middle of the room that you can't do anything with for
 now, so you might as well leave.

 Now return to the junction and take the middle path.  Follow it as
 it leads inside a building.  Inside, follow the coiling path up to
 the top, where you'll find a Comet materia lying on the ground.

 Return to the junction again and take the eastern path.  When you
 reach another split in the path, go east, and enter the cone-shaped
 building.  Inside, you can find a Guard Source in a chest on the
 topmost floor.  Now leave and go into the building above the one that
 you were just in.  There's a chest on the ground floor containing an
 Elixir.  If you go up the ladder, you'll come across some beds and
 have the option to sleep in them.  Choose the bottom option ("No"),
 and follow the curving path up to where the last bed is.  If you look
 by the headboard, there is an Enemy Skill materia hidden behind it.

 In order to continue on with the game, you need to leave the house,
 then re-enter it and choose to sleep on the beds.  Actually, if you
 can't spot the Enemy Skills materia, then this is a good idea, since
 you'll wake up in the middle of the night and it will be clearly
 visible.

 Return to the junction and go down the middle path to the building
 where you found the Comet materia.  This time, though, the fish
 in the middle of the building will be replaced with a set of stairs
 that lead downward.  Follow them to reach another city below the
 water.  Here, there is a Save Point you can use.  Then take the
 stairs down and hop across the pillars to reach Aeris.

 Once you reach her, you have no choice but to walk up to her, then
 press the Circle button repeatedly to make Cloud raise his sword.
 Your friends will stop you in time, though.  Eventually, you'll
 have to fight a boss.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Jenova*LIFE
                LV: 50        XP:  4000      Steal:  <nothing>
                HP: 10000     AP:  350       Morph:  <cannot>

                Absorb:     Water
                No Effect:  Gravity, Poison, *Sleep, Invincibility,
                            Silence, Berserk, Confuse, Stop*
                Weakness:   Earth
                Ability:    Blue Light, Blue Flame, Aqualung, Reflect 
                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Water Altar

 All of Jenova's attacks require magic to use.  Therefore, if you have
 the Magic Hammer enemy skill, you can drain her of all MP.  She'll be
 a sitting duck after that.  However, Jenova's response to any magical
 attack or Enemy Skill is to cast Reflect on herself.  There are several
 ways to get around this.

  - Cast Reflect on yourself several rounds after Jenova has used Reflect
    on herself.  Then cast a spell or Enemy Skill (say, Magic Hammer)
    on yourself.  It will bounce back and forth, but since her Reflect
    was cast much earlier, it will run out first.
  - Use non-reflective attacks, like Comet, Beta, Trine, or any summon
    materia.
  - Equip Time + Added Effect on your weapon.  This way you still have
    a chance of Slowing her with each hit.
  - Equip Quake or Titan + Elemental on your weapon.  This way, you can
    do extra damage, since Jenova is weak against Earth attacks.  Since
    you have two Elemental materia, you should be able to do this for
    two characters.

 Otherwise, make sure someone has the Water Ring, since all of Jenova's
 attacks are water-based.  You can cast MBarrier + All on your party
 to reduce damage from her attacks (or you can use Big Guard, although
 it runs out faster).

 Don't forget to have that newly-accquired Enemy Skill materia equipped,
 so that you can learn Aqualung from Jenova before she dies.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 As much as I hate spoilers, I have to take a moment to say this.  Aeris
 is dead, and she cannot be brought back to life.  There are countless
 rumors concerning this matter, some of them quite clever, but it simply
 ISN'T POSSIBLE.  Trust me, this subject has been explored for years and
 nobody's come up with a working method...because there is none.  If you
 use a GameShark to put Aeris back in your party, the game hangs when she
 is supposed to give character-specific dialogue (she'll still say basic
 quotes).  If there was a way to revive her, then Square would have had
 to include dialogue for her in the later discs, but they didn't.

 With that out of the way, take a moment to congratulate yourself, since
 you've reached the end of Disc 1.


 ========================================================================
 4. DISC 2 WALKTHROUGH
 ========================================================================

 Please note that any references to section letters are referring to this
 section only.  If I'm referring to a section from the previous part of
 the walkthrough, I will write, "Section J, Disc One" or something along
 those lines.  Therefore, if you see a note like "refer to section J,"
 then I am referring to Section J in the Disc Two Walkthrough only.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (A)  Corral Valley Cave
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Viper Halberd, Bolt Armlet, HypnoCrown, Megalixir,
    Magic Plus materia, Power Source.

 Items to steal:
  - Water Ring (from Acrophies).

 Enemy Skills in this section:
  - Death Sentence (from Boundfat), L4 Suicide (from Trickplay).

 First off, take note of something.  Although you are now in Disc 2, the
 game will still act as if you are in Disc 1 until you get through the
 next few sections.  If you backtrack to Bone Village, you'll find that
 none of the Disc 2-specific events can take place (such as being able to
 dig up the Key to Sector 5, or trying to win the Flayer from the Speed
 Square).  However, if you want to participate in all of the Fort Condor
 battles, you better go there first before continuing after Sephiroth.

 Once you've done that, return to the Forgotten City.  Take the east
 path at the junction, and in the next area, follow the path above the
 two houses that heads off to the east.

 In this next area is a large, spiky structure that you can climb.
 However, if you stay on the ground and walk behind it, you can make
 your way to a chest containing the Viper Halberd.  Now go back and
 climb up the spiralling structure.  Then, work your way up and
 around to the long spike that leads into a hole in the cliff face.
 Trying to reach it can be tricky, but it's possible.

 You'll find yourself inside a cave.  There are two vertical crevices
 on the nearby wall.  Go over to the western one and climb up it.
 You will then be given the option to go right (first choice), or left
 (second choice).  Choose "left", then go over to the western crevice
 and climb up it.  Once again, you can go right (first choice), or
 left (second choice).  Choose either one, then attempt to leap back
 in the crevice.  You'll now have an option to go up (first choice),
 or down (second choice).  Go up to reach a chest containing the
 Bolt Armlet.

 Now go back down and choose to go left.  Run to the east until you
 reach another crevice (this one is near the glowing orange light.
 You'll have two options; up (first choice), or down (second choice).
 Choose to go down.  After moving down far enough, you'll leap onto
 a ledge where there is a chest.  Inside is the HypnoCrown.

 If you climb back up, you can go right (1st choice), or left (2nd
 choice).  Choose either one, then get back in the fissure and go up.
 At the top, choose right (the first option).  You'll reach a chest
 containing a Megalixir.  Get back in the crevice and choose to go
 left (the second option).  Run to the west to arrive at another
 fissure.  When you get in, climb up to reach a ledge.

 If you go to the west, you'll reach a long ladder.  Choose the second
 option (down), and climb all the way down to the ground level.  Here,
 you can find a Magic Plus materia.  Now climb back up, get out of the
 ladder, and then grab it again and choose to go up (the first option).
 At the top, head to the east to reach an opening in the wall.

 Past the opening is another cave.  Just to the east is another chest
 which holds a Power Source.  While you could head north to exit the
 cave, I recommend hanging around here.  You can encounter the
 Acrophies enemy (it's a large blue creature with a snake-like neck
 and a single claw), which you can steal a Water Ring from.  You might
 as well get two of them.

 Outside, if you follow the path, you'll eventually reach the Icicle Inn.

 (B)  Icicle Inn
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Turbo Ether, X-Potion, Glacier Map (a Key Item), Hero Drink, Vaccine,
    Snowboard (a Key Item).

 The building to the left is a weapon shop.

    Hi-Potion              300 gil      Item
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 If you don't have many Tents, you should make sure to buy some here.
 After you leave the Icicle Inn, you won't reach another town for quite
 some time.

 If you go into the building to the east of the Weapon Shop, you can
 find a Turbo Ether in the basement area, near the window.  There is
 a video player on the main floor against the back wall (where all
 the machinery is).  You can watch three videos by examining the video
 player and then picking the appropriate option.  Another machine will
 also open a skylight (seems to be pointless).

 Outside, go into the building with the "Inn" sign in front of it (it's
 to the east).  In here, there is a door near the stairway.  It leads
 to a bar.  There's no items here, but you can open the restroom door
 for one of the game's funnier lines.  If you go up the stairs and look
 near the window, you can find an item bag that has an X-Potion inside.

 Now go outside and go into the house to the east of the inn.  Here,
 there is a map on one of the walls that you need to take.  In the
 room behind the wall, there are also a Hero Drink and Vaccine.

 Now go outside and head over to the mayor (the man in purple) standing
 in the background.  Talk to him and pick the first option.  Elena will
 show up.  When she threatens to punch you, a window will open up,
 listing several directions.  After you close it, press left, right, or
 up to avoid Elena's attack.  If you do nothing, you'll get hit, and
 will wake up in the house with the video recorder.  It doesn't matter
 whether you take the hit or not (but dodging it results in a rather
 humorous scene).

 The next thing to do is get a snowboard.  Go into the house with the
 dog standing outside of it, and talk to the boy in the back.  He'll
 let you take his snowboard.  You can now leave the village by heading
 past the mayor.  If he's blocking your path, move away and wait for
 him to move around, then try to get past him again.
   
 You now have to go through a snowboarding scene.  Your controls are as
 follows:

        Left / Right            Move left or right
        Up                      Makes Cloud pick up speed if you're
                                going unter 20 mph.
        Down                    Reduces your speed
        Square button           Same as down
        X button                Makes Cloud jump
        R1 button               Makes you move left or right in
                                conjunction with the control pad

 There are balloons you can collect for fun, as well as obstacles, such
 as snow-moogles, rolling balls of ice, etc.  If you hit an obstacle,
 you'll get knocked over.  All you really have to do is avoid running
 into the sides of the course and the obstacles, and you'll do fine.

 As you snowboard, you'll have the option of choosing certain paths.
 Which paths you take determines where you'll end up after this scene
 ends.  Consult the chart below to see where you can go:


                      A  B  C  D         (A)  Forest

                        Start            (D)  Frostbite Cave

 You'll want to take the Forest route (go left twice), but keep reading
 for more information first.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (C)  Great Glacier (Quick Route)
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Mind Source, Potion, Safety Bit, Elixir, All materia,
    Added Cut materia, Alexander materia.

 Items to steal:
  - Circlet (from Snow).

 The Great Glacier, to put it simply, is a real pain in the neck to get
 through.  For one thing, it's a pretty large area to explore, and if
 you don't get through it fast enough, you'll pass out.  Not that there's
 anything wrong with that, but you'll then have to go all the way back to
 the Great Glacier to pick up any items you were trying to reach before
 you passed out.  Also, your current location is not marked on the map
 you got at the Icicle Inn.  So, you may have a tough time getting your
 bearings if you're not paying attention to the landmarks in each area.

 If you want to tackle this section on your own, skip down to Section
 (D).  I've drawn some maps that will help you navigate through the Great
 Glacier.

 On the other hand, if you just want to get the items and get out, I
 explain what to do in this section.  The only item I'm omitting is
 the Elixir you get in the Elixir Cave (since it wastes a lot of time
 and is not really worth it).

 Start off by choosing the snowboarding path that takes you to the Forest
 (keep going left, in other words).

 Once you reach the Forest, go north to the top of the screen and look to
 your right--there's a Mind Source lying at the base of one of the trees.
 After you get it, go east to reach the Frozen Lake.  Pick up the Potion
 at the narrow end of the lake and continue northwest to the Ice Puzzle.

 The Ice Puzzle is a mass of floating ice chunks that you have to jump
 across.  When you jump to a chunk of ice, the ice pieces around it will
 submerge (if they are sticking out of the water), or rise up (if they
 are submerged).  Therefore, you want to make sure that you don't jump
 onto an ice piece and have all the ones surrounding it sink, because
 then you'll fall into the water.

 To get across, follow this path once you're on the first piece
 of ice:
    
      North, West, South, West, North, East, North, North, North,
      West, South, East, East, North.
 
 Now go north to the Island Cave.  Inside it is a Safety Bit.  Leave,
 and go back through the Ice Puzzle.  Jump onto the ice floe near you
 and follow this path to get back across:

      West, South, East, East, South, West, South, East, South,
      West, South.

 Now that you're back at the Frozen Lake, head northeast to the Lone
 Tree, then east to the Mountain Pass.  Here, take the northeast path
 up two screens, but on the second screen, look near the curve in the
 northeast wall--there is an Added Cut materia lying on the ground.
 This materia is easy to miss, because it's hard to see (and this is
 a one-way path you're on--see Section D for details), so make sure to
 find it on the 2nd screen before continuing.  After getting it, keep
 heading up to reach the Hot Springs.

 Here, if you go to about the middle of the screen, you can walk
 southwest out onto the frozen water and touch a hot spring (examine
 it and choose the top option).  Once you've done this, head northwest
 until you reach the Snow Field.

 As you walk around the Snow Field, the screen will rotate from time to
 time.  In order to keep your bearings, use the Circle button to plant
 markers in the ground.  That way, once the screen stops moving, you
 can align yourself with the markers and continue on.

 Head North until you run into a cave.  Inside, you can find an
 All materia lying inside the tent.  Now go outside and head east
 until you leave the Snow Field and reach the Alexander Cave.

 Go inside the cave and talk to the woman in purple.  Since you touched
 the water back at the Hot Springs, she'll attack you.  After defeating
 her (and stealing a Circlet from her, if you want), she'll leave behind
 an Alexander materia that you can take.

 From here, you can go back north to the Snow Field, then north to
 Holzoff's shack.  More than likely, however, you'll pass out before
 you get that far.  It's okay, Holzoff's shack was our next destination
 anyway :)  Skip down to Section (E) to continue.
 

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (D)  Great Glacier (Maps)
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Mind Source, Potion, Safety Bit, Elixir, All materia,
    Added Cut materia, Alexander materia.

 Items to steal:
  - Circlet (from Snow).

 Navigating through the Great Glacier is a little tricky, because the
 paths from each area don't always lead to the same place depending on
 what direction you're coming from, and sometimes multiple paths lead
 to the same place.  Drawing a map of the whole area isn't really
 possible.  Instead, I've listed each major area in all caps, with paths
 branching off of them to indicate where they lead to.  Some paths have
 numbers in them--this indicates how many screens you'll have to run
 through before reaching your destination.  Areas are listed in
 alphabetical order.

 If you don't quite get it, here's an example.  Let's say you started off
 at the Lone Tree.  You'd skip down to the LONE TREE section, pick a path
 (say, east to the Mountain Pass), then go to the MOUNTAIN PASS section
 and continue on from there.

 Anyway, here are the maps:

                              /
                         Mountain Pass

 The only way to reach the Alexander Cave is by going to the east end of
 the Snow Field--you cannot reach it from any other area of the Great
 Glacier.  The path from the Snow Field to the cave is one-way only, and
 the path from the cave to the Mountain Pass is one-way only as well.

 Inside the Alexander Cave is a woman who will ask you to leave her alone
 if you talk to her.  However, if you've touched the water at the Hot
 Springs, then she will attack you.  However, since she's just a common
 Snow monster, beating her is not too difficult.  Once she's dead, you'll
 receive the Alexander materia.

                       Plane Tail

 As you can see, this area has many paths, but most of them take you to
 the same place.  The "two screen" path from the Elixir Cave to the
 Fallen Tree is one-way only (which is why it always takes three screens
 to go from the Fallen Tree to the Elixir Cave).

 There is a small cave with two entrances in the middle of this area.
 Inside, you can find an Elixir in the northern part of the cave.

 In this area, there is a cave entrance to the east.  If you go inside,
 then head north and east, you'll reach an ice slide.  If you go down
 it, you'll be carried outside of the Great Glacier and returned to the

 There is a Potion at the narrow end of the Frozen Lake.
            
 The Ice Puzzle is a mass of floating ice chunks that you have to jump
 across.  When you jump to a chunk of ice, the ice pieces around it will
 submerge (if they are sticking out of the water), or rise up (if they
 are submerged).  Therefore, you want to make sure that you don't jump
 onto an ice piece and have all the ones surrounding it sink, because
 then you'll fall into the water.

 To get across, follow this path once you're on the first piece
 of ice:
    
      North, West, South, West, North, East, North, North, North,
      West, South, East, East, North.

 Once you've gone to the Island Cave and want to get back across,
 follow this path once you're on the ice floe:

      West, South, East, East, South, West, South, East, South,
      West, South.

 Inside the Island Cave is a bag containing a Safety Bit.

 Alexander materia later on (see the Alexander Cave Map for more info.)

 The northeast path to the Hot Springs is one-way only.  Furthermore,
 on the second screen of the path, there is a curve in the northeast
 wall about halfway up the path.  If you look closely, you can find an
 Added Cut materia lying on the ground there.

 Remember, since this path is one-way, the ONLY WAY for you to get the
 Added Cut materia is to go northeast from the Mountain Pass.  It's
 impossible to reach it from the Hot Springs.  A lot of people can't
 find the Added Cut materia and this is why.

 *  There is a cave in the middle of the Snow Field.  As long as you
    keep going straight from one direction to the other (say, north to
    south, or east to west), then you'll run into it.  Inside the cave
    is an All materia.

 As you walk around the Snow Field, the screen will rotate from time to
 time.  In order to keep your bearings, use the Circle button to plant
 markers in the ground.  That way, once the screen stops moving, you
 can align yourself with the markers and continue on.

 If, while exploring, you pass out, you might as well check out the start
 of the next section for more information.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (E)  Gaea's Cliff
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 Items in this section:
  - Ribbon, Javelin, Elixir, Fire Armlet, Megalixir, Speed Source,
    Enhance Sword, Dragon Fang.

 Items to steal:
  - Protect Ring (from Schizo's right head)

 Items to win:
   - Dragon Armlet (from Blue Dragon)

 Enemy Skills in this section:
  - Bad Breath (from Malboro), Magic Breath (from Stilva),
    Trine (from Stilva).

 If you made it this far without passing out, you can always go into
 Holzoff's shack and talk to him.  More than likely, however, you woke
 up in his house after passing out while in the Great Glacier.  After he
 talks to you, go into the living room and answer his question any way
 you like.  When he's done talking, choose the bottom option ("Yes").
 The next morning, you can make use of the Save Point, if you wish.

 When you go outside, your friends will be waiting for you.  Answer
 Barret's question in any way you like.  You can switch party members
 by talking to your friends.

 If you weren't done item-hunting in the Great Glacier, you can always
 go south to reach the Snow Field.  Otherwise, it's time to scale Gaea's
 Cliff, so head north.

 The key to getting through this level alive is keeping your body
 temperature up.  You can only do this when standing on a ledge (not
 when climbing up a wall).  Simply tap Square rapidly in order to
 raise your body heat.  In the Japanese version of FF7, keeping your
 temperature high was a real nightmare, but they toned it down
 considerably for the US version.

 Another thing to keep in mind is that those orange flags you see on
 the cliffs indicate a path that you can take.

 Anyway, the first part of the cliff is fairly straightforward.  Just
 keep climbing up until you reach a cave entrance.  Inside, head north
 and go through the opening in the wall.  In the next area, there is
 a ramp leading up to a landing to the west.  If you touch the south
 wall, you'll find that it's a passage that leads to another area.
 If you head east, the path turns to the north, but in fact there is
 a hard-to-see entrance on the east wall that you can go through.
 It leads to a chest containing a Ribbon.  Now go back and take the
 north path up to where a chest is.  Inside is a Javelin.  Now, go
 through the nearby hole in the wall.

 In this next area, follow the path as it leads up to a ledge with
 a boulder.  Push the boulder over, and it will crush a mass of
 crystal that was blocking your way.  Now leave and go back to the
 area with the ramp.  Take the north path (which is no longer
 obstructed) as it leads through the rest of the cave.  Eventually,
 you'll find yourself outside again.

 If you climb up the cliff face, you'll then be given the option to
 go up (top choice), down (middle choice), or right (bottom choice).
 Choose up and keep climbing.  You'll then be given the option to
 go right (first choice), or down (second choice).  Go right until
 you reach another ledge.  Here, go north, then go northwest to
 reach yet another ledge.  Finally take the path northwest to reach
 another cave opening.

 Inside, if you look to the northeast, you can find a chest which holds
 an Elixir.  There's also a Save Point in the northwest corner.  If you
 haven't already learned the "Bad Breath" skill from the Malboro enemies
 (they're big green monsters with huge mouths and tentacles), now is a
 good time, since you can save your game.  First of all, make sure one
 or more people have a Ribbon equipped.  Then go back outside to Gaea's
 Cliff and just run back and forth in the cave entrance until you
 encounter one (don't forget to keep your body heat up).  Once you
 encounter a Malboro, just wait for it to use it's Bad Breath on you.
 You can then kill it easily with L4 Suicide.  If you don't have a
 Ribbon, then don't bother fighting this enemy, as it's Bad Breath
 inflicts just about every status ailment there is.

 Once you're ready to continue, go back inside and go through the opening
 that is east of the Save Point.  If you follow the path, you will
 eventually reach an icy walkway with icicles hanging from the ceiling.
 Next to the entrance is a chest containing a Fire Armlet.  When you
 try to run past the icicles, you will have to fight them, along with
 four Evilheads.  Since Evilheads don't have a lot of life, and the
 Icicle is weak against several elements (Fire, Gravity, and Earth), the
 battles should not be much of a problem for you.

 Each time you destroy an icicle, you'll have the option to jump down
 to the room below (the bottom option), or stay where you are (the top
 option).  Doing this is sort of pointless, at least until you've
 destroyed three icicles.  However, you can get some good items if you
 beat all four, so keep fighting until they're defeated.

 Once you destroy the last icicle, you can get to a chest which contains
 a "Last Elixir."  In fact, what you really get is a Megalixir, but the
 translation staff didn't bother to change the name of this item (since
 Megalixirs are called "Last Elixirs" in the Japanese version of FF7).

 An easy way to get down to the bottom floor is to leave the room and
 come back.  You'll be given the option to jump down again, so do so.

 Down in the main room, you'll see that the fallen icicles have raised
 the floor up quite a bit.  If you knocked down three icicles, you'll
 be able to leave through the opening on the north wall.  However, if
 you knocked down all four, you can reach the chest in the northwest
 corner, which contains a Speed Source.  Once you go through the
 opening on the north wall, you'll find a chest, which holds an Enhance
 Sword.

 If you follow the path, it eventually leads back outside.  After
 climbing north, you have the option to go up (first choice), left
 (second choice), or right (bottom choice).  Go up, and keep climbing
 until you're given another option.  This time you can go up (first
 choice), down (second choice), or down and to the right (third choice).
 Once again, go up to the next ledge, then go up again to reach another
 cave opening.

 In here, there is a Save Point, and a pool of light you can examine to
 restore your HP and MP.  If you haven't already learned the Trine and
 Magic Breath skills from the Stilva enemies, hang around here until you
 fight one.  You can even Manipulate it and have it use it's skills on
 you.  If you miss the chance to learn Trine now, your only other way
 to learn it is by fighting Godo in Wutai (see Disc 1, Section V for more
 information).

 Although they are rare, you can also run into Blue Dragons here, which
 have a fair chance of dropping a Dragon Armlet when defeated.

 When you're ready to go on, continue down the path, and you'll run into
 a boss monster.

 Schizo (Right)
                LV: 43        XP:  4400      Steal:  Protect Ring
                HP: 18000     AP:  240       Morph:  <cannot>
                MP: 350       Gil: 3000      Leaves: Dragon Fang
                Absorbs:    Fire
                No Effect:  Gravity, Poison, *Petrify, Slow-numb, Frog,
                            Minimum, Parlysis, Sleep, Berserk, Haste,
                            Slow, Stop, Invincibility, Silence*
                Ability:    [Fire Breath], [Twin Breath], [Earth Attack],
                            [Lightning Attack]
                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Gaea's Cliff
                Notes:      This is the scaly head of Schizo.  The
                            amounts listed are for both heads, since
                            you fight them at the same time.

 Schizo (Left)
                LV: 43        XP:  4400      Steal:  <nothing>
                HP: 18000     AP:  240       Morph:  <cannot>
                MP: 350       Gil: 3000      Leaves: Dragon Fang
                Absorbs:    Cold
                No Effect:  Gravity, Poison, *Petrify, Slow-numb, Frog,
                            Minimum, Parlysis, Sleep, Berserk, Haste,
                            Slow, Stop, Invincibility, Silence*
                Ability:    [Icy Breath], [Twin Breath], [Earth Attack],
                            [Lightning Attack]
                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Gaea's Cliff
                Notes:      This is the horned head of Schizo.  The
                            amounts listed are for both heads, since
                            you fight them at the same time.

 The easiest way to take care of Schizo is to use Magic Hammer four times
 on each head.  Since all of their attacks require MP to use, they will
 be unable to do a thing to you.  You may want to cast Big Guard on your
 party in the meantime, because that will cast Haste on everyone, as well
 as MBarrier, will reduce damage from all of Schizo's attacks.

 If you don't have Magic Hammer, the battle will take a while.  You can
 always wear a Fire or Ice Ring to take no damage from a particular
 head's breath weapon (you could also pair Elemental + the appropriate
 materia on your armor).  Beyond that, it's a good idea to cast Mbarrier
 + All on your party.  You can use Big Guard, but it wears out quickly,
 so you'll have to recast it often. Needless to say, Cure2 + All or
 White Wind will come in handy.

 Don't bother attacking with multiple-element spells, like Magic Breath
 or Kjata, as they will simply heal the heads.  Since one head absorbs
 Ice damage and the other Fire, you should rely on spells like Aqualung
 (Trine also works, though not as well), or else use non-elemental
 attacks (like Comet).  Alexander works particularly well.

 The one thing you have to be careful about is when you kill a head.
 As soon as it's life drops to zero, that head will do a lightning-
 based attack that hits the whole party for a fair amount of damage.
 If you kill both heads at the same time, they will each do their
 final attack on you before dying.  The easiest way to get around this
 is give someone a Bolt Ring, and pair Elemental + Lightning or Ramuh
 on the other characters' armor.  Otherwise, MBarrier will reduce
 the damage taken.

 Also, note that the last defeated head gives you a Dragon Fang.  You
 don't get one from each head.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 After killing Schizo, you might want to return to the healing pool and
 Save Point, if you're in bad shape.  Otherwise, continue down the
 passage.  Outside, climb up the ice wall. 


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (F)  The Crater / Whirlwind Maze
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Neo Bahamut materia, Hi-Potion, Ether, Kaiser Knuckle, Reflect Ring,
    MP Turbo materia, Poison Ring.

 Items to steal:
  - Gigas Armlet (from Gigas)

 After climbing to the top of Gaea's Cliff, you'll find yourself going
 down the steep sides of a crater.  The crater is only two screens long,
 (and you only encounter enemies in the first screen) so it's not much of
 a hike.  You can steal Gigas Armlets from the Gigas monsters in this
 area, but at this point in the game, you probably have better equipment
 on hand.

 Anyway, once you reach the bottom of the crater, Tifa will join you if
 she's not already in your party.  As you head west, you'll come across
 a Neo Bahamut materia lying near the bottom of the screen, partially
 obscured by a rock.  There's also a nearby Save Point that you can use.
 In the next area, if you examine the men who were repelled by the
 barrier, you can get a Hi-Potion and an Ether.

 Getting past the barrier is pretty straightforward.  Wait until the
 "wall of wind" is almost invisible, then run across.  If you mess up,
 you'll have to fight a Wind Wing enemy.  Past the barrier is a curving
 path.  Halfway up is a treasure chest containing a Kaiser Knuckle.

 You'll then reach another barrier.  It's much like the first one, but
 now a "ripple" of energy will travel across the screen.  In order to
 get across, you have to time it so that the ripple doesn't hit you
 and that the wind is at it's weakest.

 Past the second barrier, you'll have another run-in with Jenova.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Jenova*DEATH
                LV: 55        XP:  6000      Steal:  <nothing>
                HP: 25000     AP:  400       Morph:  <cannot>
                MP: 800       Gil: 5000      Leaves: Reflect Ring
                No Effect:  *Gravity, Poison, Stop, Invincibility,
                            Berserk, Confuse, Sleep*
                Ability:    Red Light, Tropic Wind, Silence
                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Whirlwind Maze

 Like the last time you fought Jenova, all of her attacks cost MP to use.
 So, if you use Magic Hammer eight times on her, she will just sit there
 for the rest of the battle.

 All of Jenova's attacks are Fire-based, and by now you should have a
 Fire Ring, Fire Armlet, and Dragon Armlet, which you can use to protect
 your party (or in lieu of the Dragon Armlet, you can pair Elemental and
 Fire or Ifrit on someone's armor).

 If you don't have Magic Hammer and you don't have any anti-fire items,
 then cast MBarrier on yourself to reduce the damage of her attacks.
 Spells don't work that well on her, although Magic Breath, Aqualung
 and Trine (in that order of preference) can be used.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 After the battle, you will have to give the Black Materia to someone.
 You can give it to either Barret or Red XIII (unless one of them is
 in your party at the time).  Afterwards, you can find an MP Turbo
 materia lying on the ground just to the north (and it's yellow, eheh).
 North of that is a Save Point and a chest containing a Poison Ring.

 Ahead is the third and final barrier.  In addition to everything that
 the second barrier had, lightning will also strike the ground in short
 bursts.  So in order to get across, you need to time it so that the
 wind has died down, the ripple of energy is nowhere near you, and
 there is no lightning heading your way.

 Past the barrier, you'll find yourself in what appears to be Nibelheim.
 Talk to Tifa when you get the chance, and the scene will change to when
 Nibelheim was on fire.  For no particular reason, you can go to your
 Menu screen during this time :)  Once you're in control of Cloud, talk
 to Sephiroth, then Tifa twice.

 Once you meet the Shinra and whoever was holding the Black Materia
 shows up, you have to press the buttons to make Cloud react and walk
 over to them.  Once Cloud gets separated from everyone else, all you
 have to do is walk over to the large blue object.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (G)  Return to Junon
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Enemy Skills in this section:
  - Matra Magic (from Death Machine).

 When you get the chance, talk to Barret.  After following Tifa, you'll
 arrive at a room with a Save Point.  Once you've saved, you may want to
 take a moment to properly outfit Barret with some good equipment and
 Materia (don't bother with Tifa).  Although Cloud is gone, all of his
 materia have been given back to you, as has his accessory.  However,
 his weapon and armor are gone (don't worry, you'll get them back later).
 Now follow Tifa into the Press Room.  After Cait Sith shows up, you'll
 have to fight two Attack Squad enemies.  Afterwards, take a moment to
 outfit Cait Sith with his proper items and materia.

 As Barret, go over to the door and examine it, then press back three
 times to make him attempt to open it.  You won't be able to open it,
 so just leave.  In the hallway outside, go southeast and follow the
 path south.  Although, before you leave, if you haven't yet learned it,
 you can learn Matra Magic from the Death Machines in this area.

 Outside, if you got Yuffie to join you previously, she will be here
 masquerading as a newscaster.  Talk to her, and she'll join your party.
 Follow the path and you'll find yourself back at the airport.  To get
 to the upper level, examine the yellow box in the midst of the large
 platform.  Once you've moved up, head towards the airship.

 Now you'll have to help Tifa escape.  Don't fret...the gas is harmless,
 and you can take as long as you want to escape.  Your controls are as
 follows:

        Triangle button         Use your head
        Square button           Use your right arm
        Circle button           Use your left arm
        X button                Use your legs

 You have to use the buttons (both alone and in combinations) in order
 to get the key and free yourself from the chair.  Both of these methods
 will work:

          X, X, Triangle, X + Triangle, Square + Triangle, Square
      or  X, X, Triangle, X + Triangle, Circle + Triangle, Circle
      
 Once you're free, examine the light to the west of the chair to shut
 off the gas.  Then try to open the door on the east wall.  Once the
 roof is blown open, go over to it and Tifa will climb up and to the
 outside.  Now work your way down the front of the tower.  The guards
 can't catch you, so just ignore them.  Once you jump down to the
 Mako Cannon, run along it to the northeast until the screen changes.
 Keep going and make your way to the nozzle, at the far end.  Scarlet
 will show up and challenge you to a slapping match.  It doesn't
 really matter who wins; just time your Circle button presses and try
 to slap her before she attacks you.  Once you two finish, Barret
 will come to your rescue.

 Once you're on the Highwind, go indoors and head over to the cockpit.
 Talk to Red XIII, then Cid.  Afterwards, leave the cockpit and go to
 the "Operation" room.  Talk to the man in the corner to set up a new
 party, then go back and talk to the pilot-in-training.  Pick the top
 option to take control of the Highwind.  Its' controls are as follows:


        Left / Right            Move left / right
        Up / Down               Descend / ascend
        L1 / R1 buttons         Turn to the left or right
        Square button           You can hold this and use the control
                                pad to make the airship move without
                                accelerating.
                                ship around
        Circle button           Accelerate
        Triangle button         Explore the ship
        X button                Land the airship

 You can only land the airship on level grassy surfaces.  You cannot
 land in mountains, rivers, forests, or on the shore, etc.  Also, the
 Buggy and Tiny Bronco are gone for good, unfortunately.  Furthermore,
 you cannot return to the Gold Saucer until later on in the game.

 Those of you trying to attend all the Fort Condor battles will want
 to return there, since another battle is about to take place.
 
 Anyway, the next few sections cover optional events that you can go on
 now that you have the Highwind.  If you want to get on with the game,
 then skip down to section (M).

 (H)  Shopping List

 Now that you have an airship, there are tons of things to do.  For one
 thing, if you revisit most cities, you'll find that they are selling
 different items now.  Below is a list of shops which are selling items
 other than what they sold in Disc 1:

 So, if you want to do some shopping, you know where to go.  Actually,
 we'll be stopping by several of these places in section (L), so you may
 want to read that first.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (I)  Breeding Chocobos
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Chocobo Lure materia, Enemy Skill materia, EXP Up materia,
    Gil Up materia.

 Enemy Skills in this section:
  - Goblin Punch (from Goblin).

 This section deals with breeding Chocobos.  You don't have to breed
 Chocobos in order to beat the game, but if you don't, you'll be missing
 out on some really good materia.  Breeding Chocobos can be tricky, but
 luckily for you, the Chocobo Sage and Chole can help guide you through
 the process (or you can just read this section, if you want more
 explicit instructions).

 What's the point of breeding Chocobos?  Well, you can create Chocobos
 that are of different colors, and they have special abilities, as
 explained below:

 Blue Chocobos (aka River Chocobos)
  - They can traverse rivers and walk in shallow water.

 Green Chocobos (aka Mountain Chocobos)
  - They can move over mountains, and most (but not all) cliffs and
    drops.

 Black Chocobos (aka "Mountain & River" Chocobos)
  - They have the abilities of both Blue and Green Chocobos, and can
    move over any type of cliff or drop, as well as walk up or down
    waterfalls.  They can also walk over areas like the Great Glacier
    and the canyon surrounding the Forgotten City.

 Gold Chocobos (aka Ocean Chocobos)
  - They have the same abilities as Black Chocobos, but can also swim
    in the ocean, allowing you to go pretty much anywhere.  They're
    also the only kind of Chocobo that can run around in the Corel
    Desert.
                                            
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Before continuing, note that there is a random element to Chocobo
 breeding.  You'll have to save your game often, in case you mate two
 Chocobos and don't get the desired offspring.  You can increase the
 chance of getting a favorable result by racing your Chocobos at the
 Gold Saucer, which will raise their rank.  However, you can't do this
 until you get Cloud in your party, which means that you'll have to
 wait for a while.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 With that out of the way, let's get to work:

 GETTING A BLUE AND/OR GREEN CHOCOBO
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Get in the Highwind and return to the Chocobo Farm.  If you look by the
 east end of the fence, you'll find another Chocobo Lure materia lying
 around.  If you already sold or lost your first one, be sure not to do
 the same with this one...it's the only one you'll get.

 If you have some spare money and would like to breed some Chocobos,
 then go into the house next to the barn and talk to Choco Bill.  Then
 talk to him again and pick the first option.  He'll lend you a stable
 for 10,000 gil a pop.  Buy at least three of them.

 Now go back to Bone Village.  Land in the grassy area and run around
 until you encounter a Vlakorados.  Steal a Carob Nut from it, and then
 kill it or run away.  Repeat this until you have three Carob Nuts.

 Back in the Highwind, pilot it to the northern continent (where the
 Icicle Inn is).  If you look around in this area, you'll find a lone
 house in a basin with a patch of grass next to it.  Land on the grass
 and go inside.  If you examine the green chocobo inside, you'll get
 the fourth and final Enemy Skill materia.  The Chocobo Sage lives
 here, and you can talk to him to find out about breeding Chocobos.
 You can also buy items from him by picking the top option.
                     
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Chocobo Sage General Store
    Porov Nut              2000 gil     Item
    Pram Nut               2500 gil     Item
    Sylkis Greens          5000 gil     Item
    Reagan Greens          3000 gil     Item
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 I'd recommend buying one Porov Nut from him, but you don't have to.

 Now you need to go to Goblin Island.  If you look at your World Map,
 you'll see that there are a chain of islands to the northeast, out in
 the middle of the ocean.  The largest island has a forest on it.  If
 you land and run around in the forest, you'll encounter the Goblin
 monster.  Not only can you earn the "Goblin Punch" Enemy Skill from
 them, but you can also steal Zeio Nuts from them, and you need at least
 one.

 Now it's time to catch chocobos.  Since you bought some Chocobo stalls,
 you can return any chocobo you catch to the Chocobo Farm.  There are
 several types of chocobos that you can catch, as listed below:

 Type           Appearance                      Location
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Poor           Walking with head drooped       Icicle Area
 Average        Standing in place               Anywhere
 Good           Walking upright                 Gold Saucer Area
 Great          Running upright                 Mideel Area
 Wonderful      Racing low to the ground        Icicle Area

 You won't know what your chocobo's type is until you return to the farm
 and have Choco Billy look at it.  However, you increase your chances of
 getting a desirable type by looking for Chocobos in certain locations
 (for example, you're more likely to find a Great Chocobo at Mideel than
 you would elsewhere).

 For now, you need to get at least one Good and one Great Chocobo.  So,
 go to the tracks near the Gold Saucer, equip a Chocobo Lure materia,
 and run around until you encounter a Chocobo.  Kill off all the enemies,
 and you will have captured it.  When you return to the World Map, get
 off the Chocobo, and you'll have the option to send it back to the
 Chocobo Farm (pick the top option).

 Remember, you can only capture four chocobos at any one time.  In order
 to make more room, you have to put some of those chocobos into the
 stables, or else let them go.  If you try to send a fifth chocobo back
 to the Farm, it won't show up.

 Once you've caught a Chocobo at the Gold Saucer Area, return to the
 Chocobo Farm.  Go into the barn and talk to Choco Billy.  Pick the
 second option (Moving Chocobos), and then look through the Chocobos
 that you caught.  Hopefully, at least one of them is a Good (walking)
 Chocobo.  You only need one, so put it in a stable, and let the other
 chocobos go (you can do this by selecting them, then picking the
 second option to release them).  You need to do this so that you'll
 have enough free room to capture more Chocobos.

 Now you need at least one Great Chocobo.  You can find them on the
 isle of Mideel, in the southeast corner of the map (the tracks are
 near a forest).  Capture your Chocobos, release them, and return to
 the Chocobo Farm.  Before you enter the farm, save your game.  This
 is because a Chocobo's gender is only determined when you try to
 put them in a stable.  Now go and talk to Choco Billy, and look at
 the Chocobos you caught.  If one of them is a Great Chocobo (the
 kind that run while upright), then put it in a stable.  If it has
 the same gender as the walking Chocobo, just reset your game and
 try again (since the gender may change).

 Once you get a walking and running chocobo of opposite genders, save
 your game again.  You'll now need to mate them.  You can do this by
 talking to Choco Billy and picking the fifth option ("Mating").  Then
 examine the two chocobos who you want to mate.  Choose the top option
 to confirm your selection.  You'll then be asked to pick which kind of
 nut you want to use.  Choose a Carob Nut (the seventh option).  Now
 pick the top option to mate the two together.

 Hopefully, you will get either a blue or green Chocobo the following
 morning.  If you didn't, just reset and keep trying until you do.  You
 can improve the chance of getting a colored Chocobo by racing it at
 the Gold Saucer, but you won't be able to do that until you get Cloud
 back in your party (although if you want to wait until then, you
 certainly can).


 GETTING A BLACK CHOCOBO
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Now you need to get another Chocobo who is the opposite color and gender
 of your baby chocobo.  For example, if you got a green, female chocobo,
 you need to get a blue, male chocobo.  There are several ways to do this.
 If you only bought three stalls, get rid of your yellow Chocobos, and
 capture another Great Chocobo from Mideel.  You can then mate it with
 your colored Chocobo after enough time has passed (since baby chocobos
 can't mate until some time has gone by).  When enough time has passed,
 mate the two chocobos together using a Carob Nut.  Hopefully you'll end
 up with a Chocobo of the opposite color and gender.
                                     
 If you have four stalls, then you can always mate your two yellow
 chocobos again, in the hopes that they'll give you a chocobo of the
 opposite color and gender.  However, you'll have to wait a while to
 do this, since Chocobos that just mated can't mate again for a while.
 If you don't want to wait, you can always release your yellow Chocobos
 and capture another Good Chocobo from the Gold Saucer Area and one
 more Great Chocobo from the Mideel area, then mate them.

 In any case, by following the steps above, you should end up with a
 blue and green chocobo of the opposite gender at some point.  You'll
 have to wait a while before you can mate them (since one of them is
 still a baby).

 Once you're able to mate them, you can give them a Carob nut (this is
 what Chole recommends) by choosing the 7th option.  Personally, I think
 the Porofu Nut (the 6th option--it's a misspelling of "Porov Nut," the
 kind you bought from the Chocobo Sage) works better, but that's just
 me.  With any luck, you'll get a black Chocobo the next morning.


 GETTING A GOLD CHOCOBO
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The chance of getting a Gold Chocobo without racing it at the Gold
 Saucer is dismally low.  However, you can only go to the Gold Saucer
 once you get Cloud back in your party (which is discussed more in
 section Q).  So, you may want to wait until then.  Once you're ready,
 keep reading.

 If you only have three stables, then you'll need to turn loose your
 Blue and Green Chocobos.  Don't worry, the Black one has all of their
 abilities and more.

 Now we need to get a Wonderful Chocobo.  Pilot the Highwind to the
 Icicle Inn.  Near the town are some Chocobo tracks, and near those
 is a grassy outcropping.  So, land on the grass, then go over to the
 Chocobo tracks and catch some Chocobos (don't forget to have your
 Chocobo Lure materia equipped so you can meet them).  Unfortunately,
 you also have a good chance of catching a poor chocobo, so you may
 have to come back here after returning to the Chocobo Farm, if all
 you caught were poor chocobos.

 Once you get a Wonderful chocobo, make sure it is the opposite gender
 of your Black Chocobo.  Once the two are ready to mate, feed them a
 Zeio Nut.  If both of your chocobos are at S class, the chance of you
 getting a Gold Chocobo will be pretty good.

 Once you have a Gold Chocobo, you should be able to win races at the
 Gold Saucer's Chocobo Square without much trouble, even against Joe
 (aka Teioh), especially if you load your ride down with Greens to
 increase it's stats.  This is a great way to earn GP, which you can
 then use to purchase the "EXP Plus" and/or "Gil Plus" materia from the
 Wonder Square vendor.  You can only purchase these items once, so it's
 good to get them now (so that you can master them sooner).  Getting
 them is not required, but if you want every materia in the game, you
 might as well pick them up.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (J)  Chocobo-Only Areas
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Quadra Magic materia, Mime materia, HP<->MP materia,
    Knights of Round materia.

 Other items:
  - Death Penalty and Chaos manual (after a set amount of time passes)

 Once you have a colored Chocobo, you can use it to reach normally
 inaccessible areas which contain some powerful materia.  This section
 explains where these areas are.

 To begin, choose which chocobo you want to ride out of the Chocobo Farm
 (blue, green, black, or gold).  Once you're outside, you can actually
 put the Chocobo in the Highwind, then pilot your airship where you want
 to go before releasing your Chocobo.


 QUADRA MAGIC MATERIA
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chocobo required: Blue, Black, or Gold.

 This is located in a cave at the end of a peninsula in the Mideel Area,
 on the northeastern tip of the longest island.

 If you have a Black or Gold Chocobo, just land on the grassy area south
 of the cave, then ride over the cliff and head towards the cave.

 If you have a blue Chocobo, then pilot the Airship to Mideel.  Just
 south of the town is a peninsula with a grassy tip.  Land here, and
 ride your blue chocobo north.  You can use the areas of shallow water
 to make your way over to another isle, and then to another one, at
 the end of which is a cave containing the Quadra Magic materia.


 MIME MATERIA
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chocobo required: Green, Black, or Gold.

 This is located in a cave at the end of a peninsula on the Wutai
 continent.

 Simply land the Highwind at Wutai and ride your Chocobo south and across
 the first bridge.  If you look to the west, you'll see a peninsula
 sticking out with a cave on it.  You can then ride over the mountains
 to reach the cave.  Inside is the Mime materia.


 LUCRECIA'S WATERFALL
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chocobo required: Green, Black or Gold.

 (You can also come here if you have a submarine, which you won't get
 until section R).
 
 There's no point in visiting the waterfall until you get Cloud back in
 your party (see section P).  Once you do, put Vincent in your party.
 If you get in the Highwind and look around on the mid-west continent,
 you'll find a river that cuts horizontally through the continent,
 leading from Nibelheim to the Corel Desert.  In the midst of the river
 is a waterfall surrounded by mountains.

 Land your airship on some nearby grass, then ride your chocobo over
 the mountains to the waterfall.  Get off the chocobo and enter the
 waterfall from the west side.  Vincent will have a flashback.  After
 it ends, your party will be back on the World Map.  If you leave and
 return here a few hours later with Vincent in your party (it can still
 be during Disc 2, or you can wait until Disc 3), you'll find the Death
 Penalty weapon and Vincent's final Limit Break manual lying on the
 floor.  You can also do the whole procedure in Disc 3, if you don't
 want to get it just yet.


 HP<->MP MATERIA
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chocobo required: Black or Gold.

 Go to Rocket Town and land the airship.  Now head across the shallows
 to the barren area that's slightly south and to the east of Rocket
 Town.  There's a river cutting through the barren area, and across
 the river is a cave opening.  Inside is the HP<->MP materia.
                          

 KNIGHTS OF ROUND MATERIA
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chocobo required: Gold.

 Park the Highwind at Goblin Island and ride your Gold Chocobo to the
 northeast corner of the map.  You'll come across an island surrounded
 by tall cliffs.  In the middle of it is a forest and a cave opening.
 Inside the cave is the Knights of Round materia.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (K)  Ancient Forest
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Supershot ST, Spring Gun Clip, Slash-All materia, Minerva Band,
    Typoon materia, Apocalypse, Elixir.

 Items to steal:
  - Wizard Bracelet (from Epionlis)

 The Ancient Forest is another area that you can reach if you have a
 colored Chocobo (in this case, green, black, or gold).  If you go to
 Cosmo Canyon and look around, you'll see a gray mountain sticking out
 of the top of one of the forested clifftops.  This is where the Ancient
 Forest is.

 It's possible to get here without using a Chocobo, but you can't do
 that until later on in the game, after you beat the Ultimate Weapon.
 Going to this area is optional, but there are a lot of good items you
 can find if you're willing to take the time to do some exploring.

 Inside the forest, you'll see frogs and insects hopping about.  You
 can pick them up and drop them using the Circle button.  What's more,
 you can actually use them to get through the forest.  You also run the
 risk of getting trapped in certain areas, in which case you can return
 to the start of the forest (resetting any progress you've made,
 unfortunately) by pressing the Square button.

 Start off by taking the path that goes up.  It leads to a snapping
 plant with an item bag lying on it.  To grab the item bag, tap the
 controller very lightly so that you move forward just a step, then
 press Circle to see if you can pick up the bag.  Keep inching forward
 until you're able to do so.  If you just try and run over to the bag,
 the plant will close on you, doing quite a bit of damage to your
 party.  Inside the item bag is the Supershot ST.

 Now go back and pick up a fly.  Take the lower path, which leads up
 to a little hill and three hanging pitcher plants.  Leave the fly at the
 base of the hill and bring the other two flies over as well, as well as
 the hopping frog.  Now what you have to do is pick up a fly, climb
 up the little hill so that you're close to the hanging plant, and press
 Circle to release the fly, which will fall into the plant.  You can then
 stand on top of the plant, so go back, get another fly, hop onto the
 first plant, drop it into the second one, and repeat until all three
 plants are full.  Then jump across.  You have to do all this very
 quickly, as the flies will hop out after enough time has elapsed.

 On the other side, go over to the pink flower and press forward to make
 your character grab it and swing across.  Then go around and behind the
 tree trunk.  There's another bag here containing a Spring Gun Clip.  Now
 head east to reach the next area.

 Here, pick up the hopping fly, and head over to where one of the hanging
 pink plants is.  You can then pick the top option to leap up to the ledge
 near the plant.  Put the fly into the hanging plant, then leap across
 both of them and grab the pink plant to swing down to the ground.

 Here, pick up the frog and continue to the east.  There is a hill here
 between two pitcher plants.  Climb up the hill and face to the west,
 then release the frog, and it will leap into the left plant.  Now hop
 onto the plant and stand there--eventually, the frog will try to escape,
 which will send you flying up to where there is a gray wasps' nest.
 Pick up the nest and press down to leap down to the ground.  Now move
 close to the large snapping plant and press the Circle button to release
 the nest.  If you're close enough, the nest will land in the center of
 snapping plant, which will close around it.  You can now get the yellow
 sphere lying near the base of the plant, which is a Slash-All materia.

 Now go back to where the frog is (the one that escaped from the pitcher
 plant).  Pick it up and go back to the hill, but face right this time,
 so that the frog leaps into the righthand plant.  Then jump atop the
 plant and wait for the frog to leap out.  This will propel you past the
 large snapping plant.  Now go east to the next area.

 In this area, deposit the two flies near the hanging plants, then put
 them into the plants and leap across them.  When you grab the tendril
 of the pink plant, you'll be propelled up into the treetops.  From here,
 go west and then south down the trunk.  This takes you back to the
 previous area, where you saw an unreachable item bag.  Now you can grab
 it, and inside is a Minerva Band.  Continue down the trunk until you
 land on the ground, then repeat the steps with the frog and put it in
 the righthand plant in order to get across.

 Back in the new area, repeat the steps with the flies to get back up
 into the treetops.  Go west to the large trunk, and climb up it to
 the topmost branch that leads to the east.  If you follow it over to
 where a broken branch is, you will jump off the broken end and swing
 from the three pink plants over to where another tree is.  There's an
 item bag just to the east--inside is the Typoon materia.

 Now go back to the west, swinging across the three plants to the first
 tree.  There's a path at the base of the broken branch that leads to
 the right and down to the screen below (you can press the Select button
 to bring up the exit if you have trouble finding it.)  It leads down
 to an area with another snapping plant and two flies.  If you look to
 the east of the snapping plant, there is a raised area near the hanging
 plants.  Pick up one of the flies and stand on the raised area, then
 throw the fly into the plant.  Then leap onto the plant and press up
 to leap up to the next one, and then up to where another wasps' nest is.

 Get the next and drop down to the ground.  Release the next when you are
 close to the plant, and it will snap shut.  Now pick up the hopping fly
 and go behind the plant, to where another hanging plant is.  Throw the
 fly in the plant and leap across to the west.  

 Here, go to the west and pick up a fly, then let go of it when you're
 standing near the hollow in the tree.  A large frog will leap out and
 eat it, so pick up the frog.  Go back over to the hanging plant near
 the snapping tree.  If you're fast enough, you can leap across before
 the fly hops out.  If it already escaped, just throw the frog in and
 hop across to the east.

 Wait for the frog to hop out, then pick it up and go past the snapping
 plant to the east, where the two hanging pitcher plants are.  Throw
 the frog into the nearest plant, then stand atop it and wait for the
 frog to leap out.  You'll be propelled across the gap and land in
 front of a cave opening.

 Inside, there is a chest to the far east which contains the Apocalypse
 sword.  Another chest to the north contains an Elixir.  Now you can
 simply go north through the exit to return to the World Map.

 Well, that's it, there are no bosses or anything like that in this
 level.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (L)  Item Hunting
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Elemental materia, Fourth Bracelet, Guard Source, Full Cure materia,
    Elixir, Guard Source.

 Items to morph:
  - Tetra Elemental (from Cactuer).

 Before getting on with the game, there are a few more free items you'll
 want to pick up.

 When you're done here, get in the Highwind and go to Nibelheim.  Now go
 to the second floor of Tifa's house and examine the piano.  If you found
 Tifa's secret savings of one gil earlier when using Cloud, Tifa will
 find an Elemental materia when you examine the piano.

 Return to the Highwind and fly to Rocket Town.  If you go into the
 shop to the west of the entrance, you can find a chest in the largest
 room that contains a Fourth Bracelet.  You can find a chest containing
 a Guard Source in the Item Shop.
 
 Now go to Cosmo Canyon, and head off to the General Store (it's on the
 far east end).  The red rope that was blocking your way previously is
 now gone, so you can follow the passage beyond it back to another room.
 Here, you can get the Full Cure materia and an item bag containing an
 Elixir and Magic Source.

 Outside, fly straight south from Cosmo Canyon, and you'll see a desert
 island in the middle of the ocean that doesn't appear on the World Map.
 This is Cactus Island, and you can fight the Cactuer enemy here (as
 opposed to the "Cactuar" enemies in the Corel Prison).  They can be
 morphed into the very useful "Tetra Elemental" accessory, which
 results in zero damage from Fire, Ice, Lightning, and Earth attacks when
 equipped.

 However, getting them can be difficult, since Cactuers are very hard to
 hit.  To get around this, Manipulate them, then lower their life using
 L4 Suicide.  Once their life is low enough to kill them in one hit, use
 Morph (since they're much easier to hit when they are Manipulated).

 If you don't have Manipulate, then I suggest equipping Vincent with the
 Sniper CR and having him use Morph, since he can never miss.  Since you
 can get as many Tetra Elementals as you want this way, you should at
 least get three of them for your current party.

 Finally, although there's no real reason to revisit Junon, here's
 some of the stuff you can do should you go there:

 You can now take the trolley up to the upper level of Junon (the area
 where the gas chamber was), but there's nothing to do up here, really.
 If you go to the path between the trolleys (the one that leads to the
 Underwater Reactor), there is an alarm on the west wall, about halfway
 down the hall that you can turn on.  Once you do, you can meet enemies
 down here.  The alarm will deactivate once you leave this area.

 If you want to get out of Junon quickly, don't forget that you can talk
 to the sailor standing in the middle of the road to take a helicopter
 back to the World Map.

 Now that you have the airship, you can also go directly to Wutai.  Of
 course, if you got Yuffie to join you, then her sub-quest will take
 place (see Disc 1, Section V).


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (M)  Mideel
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Contain materia, Curse Ring, Elixir.

 The village of Mideel is found on an island in the southeast corner of
 the map.  It's in the middle of a forest and is surrounded by several
 smaller islands.

 Just to the east of the entrance is an Item Shop, and to the north of
 it is a Materia Shop, accessible on the east side.  If you go up the
 stairs near the Item Shop, you can find a Weapon Shop as well.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 In each shop, you'll run into a hyperactive woman running around with
 her white chocobo and buying everything in sight.  Be sure to talk to
 her in each shop--this will be important later on.  If you have any
 Mimett Greens on you, then talk to her white Chocobo.  You'll then have
 the option to give it "Samolen Greens"--another mistranslation (although
 since the item is called "Mimett" in both langauges, don't ask me where
 they got "Samolen" from).  Anyway, pick the top option to give it some
 Mimett Greens, then scratch it behind the ear (the fifth option).  You
 will get the Contain materia as a reward.

 If you follow the bridge west from the Weapon Shop, you'll arrive at a
 home.  If you talk to the maid inside, though, she'll sell you some
 accessories.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Mideel Accessory Shop
    Amulet                10000 gil     Accessory
    Fire Ring              8000 gil     Accessory
    Ice Ring               8000 gil     Accessory

    White Cape             5000 gil     Accessory
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 If you go outside the house where you bought accessories and examine the
 floorboards (near the northeast corner of the house), you'll find a key
 stuck in the ground.  Go east to the weapon store, and try using the key
 on the door in the back.  When the owner asks what's wrong, pick the
 second option (to apologize).  You'll get the "Curse Ring" in return.
 If you want to see your lead character act silly, you can always pick
 the top option (to lie), but you'll have to reset the game and pick the
 other option if you want the Curse Ring.

 If you try to explore the rest of the town past the bridge, Tifa will
 stop and talk to the gray dog standing around, and then you'll run into
 Cloud.  Afterwards, Tifa will leave your party.  While you'll get her
 accessory and any materia she had equipped back, she will hold onto
 whatever weapon and armor you had equipped on her.  Now Cid will be
 the new leader of your party.  As Cid, go into the Operations room and
 assmble a new party.  Then return to the bridge and talk to the pilot in
 order to regain control of the Highwind.

 Although your next goal is to capture the Huge Materia from the Shinra,
 start off by returning to Mideel, as there's more to do here.  Go into
 the house southwest of the clinic--an old man and his dog are inside.
 There's also an Elixir lying on the man's bed.  If you take it and try
 to leave, he'll ask if you took anything.  No matter which option you
 choose, you'll get the Elixir, although if you lie about it, he'll tell
 you that it's rotten (although it's still perfectly usable).

 Finally, note that the next few sections can only be completed with Cid
 as your leader--they won't be available if you try to do them with Tifa
 in your party.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (N)  Huge Materia at Fort Condor
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Imperial Guard, Phoenix Materia, Huge Materia (a Key Item).

 Your next goal is to retrieve the Huge Materia from either North Corel
 or Fort Condor.  You can do them in any order, but the Fort Condor one
 is fairly easy to get, so let's do that first (skip to section O if you
 want to do the Corel one first).

 To get the Huge Materia, you have to fight a regiment of Shinra troops,
 just like any of the other Fort Condor battles.  To begin the battle,
 go up to the topmost floor and talk to the man near the window, then
 choose "Okay, ready."  If he has any gil left (including any gil you
 may have given him earlier to help finance battles), he will give it
 back to you.

 If you've never participated in the Fort Condor battles before, refer
 to Disc One, Section (J) for more information.  However, unlike the
 previous battles at the Fort, you don't recieve anything for winning
 the battle.  In fact, if you let the enemy win, you'll have to fight
 a CMD. Grand Horn enemy, who will leave behind an Imperial Guard item
 for you to take.  Either way, you'll still get the Phoenix Materia and
 the Huge Materia, so I'd recommend letting the enemy win.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 CMD. Grand Horn
                LV: 37        XP:  800       Steal:  <nothing>

                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Fort Condor (Huge Materia battle)

 This boss doesn't have a lot of life and can't do much aside from
 physical attacks, so just cast Barrier + All or Mighty Guard on your
 party, then wail away until he's dead.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
                                       
 After the battle, if you go outside the door, you'll find a Phoenix
 materia lying on the ground.  Now go back inside the fort and go down
 to where the man in the large hat is, sitting at the table.  Talk to
 him to get the Huge Materia.

 After you've completed this section, Fort Condor will no longer be
 attacked by Shinra soldiers.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (O)  Huge Materia at Corel Reactor
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Huge Materia (a Key Item), Ultima materia, Catastrophe manual.

 To start off, return to the Corel Reactor.  Instead of taking the Mt.
 Corel path, just park the Highwind by North Corel, then backtrack
 until you reach the reactor.  Here, you'll have to fight off two
 Attack Squad enemies.

 Afterwards, you'll have to chase after the Shinra train on your own
 train.  In order to build speed, you have to alternate between the
 Triangle and up buttons--this will make Cid operate the levers.  Try
 to develop a rhythm so you can go as fast as you're able without
 messing up the timing.  You can catch up to the other train in about
 20-30 seconds this way.

 Once you get close enough to the second train, your characters will hop
 aboard.  You'll now have to fight enemies while heading west across the
 train cars.  If you're running low on time, you can make the battles go
 by faster by using "Remove" in the first two fights (against the Gas
 Ducters).  Then use "Laser" or any Gravity spell against Wolfmeister
 and Eagle Gun (since they have a lot of HPs).  The final battle is
 against a single Attack Squad enemy, which should be a breeze for you.
 In all, it takes about four minutes to get through all the battles.

 Now, you'll have to slow down the train by using the control pad and
 the buttons.  Be sure to clear your friends' dialogue boxes before
 trying to stop the train, since Cid can't manipulate the levers until
 you do so.

 There are a number of ways to stop the train, and they all have the same
 result--the train will speed up, then slow down.  For example, you can
 input Up + the Triangle button twice, or Down + the X button twice, and
 you'll get the same outcome.

 Once you arrive at North Corel, the following will occur:

  - If you stopped the Shinra train, you'll recieve the Huge Materia,
    and a little kid will give you the Ultima materia.

  - If you got onto the Shinra train but didn't stop it, you won't
    get the Huge Materia, though you can still buy the Ultima materia
    off the kid for 50,000 gil.

  - If you didn't even make it onto the Shinra train, then you won't
    get the Huge Materia or the Ultima materia.

 Regardless of the outcome, if you go into the house below the inn, you
 can talk to a woman wearing a green cap inside to get the Catastrophe
 manual for Barret.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (P)  Return to Mideel
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Items to steal:
  - Curse Ring (from Ultimate Weapon)

 The next day after saving North Corel, Cid suggests that you go back and
 check up on Cloud.  So, return to Mideel.  Go into the clinic and talk
 to Tifa.  Then go outside.  You'll have to fight the Ultimate Weapon.
 It will run away after just a few rounds, so all you really have to do
 is stay alive.  You can also steal another Curse Ring from it, if you'd
 like.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Ultimate Weapon
                LV: <unknown> XP:  0         Steal:  Curse Ring
                HP: <unknown> AP:  0         Morph:  <cannot>
                MP: 400       Gil: 0         Leaves: <unknown>
                No Effect:    Gravity
                Ability:      Ultima Beam, [Bolt Ball], [Claw Swipe],
                              Quake2
                Manipulate:   <cannot>
                Location:     Mideel
                Notes:        Cannot sense.

 The Ultima Weapon's most potent attack is the "Ultima Beam", which can
 do a hefty amount of damage.  However, you can get around this by
 pairing a "non-elemental" materia to an Elemental materia and putting
 the two on your armor.  The following materia can be used in such a way:

                Ultima          FullCure        Contain
                Destruct        Time            Comet
                Barrier         Exit            Transform
                Mystify         Seal            Revive
                Heal            Restore         Knights of Round
                Neo Bahamut     Kjata           Bahamut
                Odin

 You should have three Elemental materia at this point, so just pair
 them up with any of the above materia and put them on your character's
 armor.

 The Ultimate Weapon's other attacks are not much to speak of.  It's
 Bolt Ball attack is Fire-based, which means you can absorb it using
 any number of items (Fire Armlets, Fire Rings, Tetra Elementals, etc.)
 It can also cast Quake2 (which is another reason to wear a Tetra
 Elemental), and it has a claw swipe attack which cannot be defended
 against, even if you cast Barrier or Big Guard on your party.

 If you are unable to protect your party against the Ultima Beam or the
 Bolt Ball attack, at least cast Big Guard or MBarrier, which will lessen
 the damage inflicted.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 Afterwards, Tifa will find herself inside Cloud's subconscious.  Head
 north and talk to the Cloud standing at the entrance to Nibelheim.
 In Nibelheim, when Cloud shows up, talk to him.  Once you return to the
 main area, talk to the Cloud who at the western edge of the screen,
 near the water tower.

 Once you return to the main area, talk to the Cloud in the east part of
 the screen, by the open window.  Then talk to the child Cloud.  When
 you reach the white area with the "shadow Cloud", talk to the real one
 standing in the lower right-hand corner.  Back in the main area, return
 to the entrance to Nibelheim.

 Finally, when you return to the main area, talk to the "shadow" Cloud
 in the middle of the screen.

 Back in the Highwind, try to leave the Operations room, and you'll be
 instructed to form a new party.  Now just talk to the pilot in the
 main room to regain control of the Highwind.
 
 If you return to Mideel, you'll find that some of the people are now
 selling different items.

    Restore                 750 gil     Magic materia
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 If you go up to the east area of town, you'll find the hyperactive
 woman and her chocobo running around.  If you talked to her before
 Mideel was destroyed, she'll sell you items from each shop that you
 talked to her in.  In other words, if you chatted with her in the
 Materia and Item shops, she will offer to sell you materia or items,
 but not weapons.

 In any case, you can buy the following items off of her:

 Now that Cloud is back in your party, there are a number of events that
 you couldn't participate in until you got him back.  This section will
 cover some of those events.

 Start by putting Tifa in your party, then return to her house at
 Nibelheim.  Play the "Highwind" theme on her piano.  If you forgot, the
 sequence is as follows:

            X, S, T, L1+T, L1+S, X, S, T, L1+X, O, X, S, X

 After playing, Tifa will find the Final Heaven manual hidden in her
 sheet music.

 You can also see a new scene that wasn't in the Japanese release by
 returning to the mansion in Nibelheim.  Go back to the caverns beneath
 the mansion and head east to where the library is.  As Cloud enters
 the room, a flashback will take place.

 Now go back to Bone Village and opt to dig for good treasure.  Stand
 beneath the nose of the crashed plane and face up (you should be
 standing at the northeast end of the little "pocket" of space between
 the nose of the plane and the left wing).  Then have the staff members
 dig here.  The next morning, you'll find the Key to Sector 5 lying in
 the chest near the main archaeologist.

 You can use the key to get back inside Midgar City (just enter the
 city and try to walk through the gate labeled "07", then head towards
 the hole in the wall that's to the northeast of the gate).

 There isn't a lot to do in Midgar, though.  If you stop in at the
 church, you can see Aeris' ghost for a brief second (I still think
 it's a glitch, but people say otherwise).  If you missed the first
 "Turtle's Paradise" flyer last time you were here, you can read it
 now.  It's in the Sector 5 Slums, in the easternmost house, taped
 to the west wall on the second floor.

 You will want to return to Wall Market, though, since you can get some
 good items here.  If you go into the building marked ITEM (it's in
 the middle of the screen, near the entrance), you can examine the
 computer terminal to get the Premium Heart weapon.  You'll also find
 that the Materia shop in the northeast corner of the first screen is
 finally selling materia.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Wall Market Materia Shop
    Fire                    600 gil     Magic materia
    Ice                     600 gil     Magic materia
    Lightning               600 gil     Magic materia
    Restore                 750 gil     Magic materia
    Cover                  1000 gil     Independent materia
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 If you return to the "Machine & Gun Shop" in the northern area of Wall
 Market and talk to the man who sold you the Batteries, he will sell you
 an item for 129,000 gil, which turns out to be the Sneak Glove.  Since
 it's the only item that increases the success rate of "Steal" and "Mug,"
 I'd suggest you buy it.
       
 Also, if you have a green, black, or gold chocobo, you can visit
 Lucrecia's waterfall now (see Section J for details).

 Speaking of chocobos, you can now return to the Gold Saucer, and what's
 more, you can race Chocobos there, if you put any into your stables at
 the Chocobo Farm (see section I for details).  To race them, go to the
 Chocobo Square and talk to Ester (the woman in the west corner of the
 room).  Choose the first option, then choose which Chocobo you want to
 race.  Pick the first option again to confirm your selection.

 You now have the option to race on a short course (top option), or a
 full-length course (bottom option).  There doesn't seem to be any
 benefit to choosing a particular course, though.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 In case you forgot how to race Chocobos, here are your controls:

        Square button   Makes your Chocobo run faster
        X button        Makes your Chocobo slow down
        Circle button   Makes your Chocobo dash
        Select button   Switches between Manual and Automatic mode.
        Start button    Once the 1st and 2nd place winners have come
                        in, you can press Start to end the race early
                        (instead of waiting for it to end).

 While racing, there is a red gauge on the left side of the screen.
 This is the Chocobo's "Stamina meter", and it gradually drains as
 your Chocobo runs (the faster your speed, the faster it drains).
 If you hold down the Circle button to dash, then it drains at a much
 faster rate.  When the gauge is empty, you can't dash, and your top
 speed is reduced.

 However, there is a trick to refill your Stamina Gauge; simply hold
 down R1 + R2 while racing.  This causes the gauge to refill slightly
 when not draining, and when it does drain, it does so at a slower
 rate than normal.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 You can't bet on yourself--instead, you will recieve a ticket if you
 win a race.  You can then trade the ticket for an item, or for some GP.
 
 If you find that your Chocobo is hard to control, you should go back to
 the Chocobo Farm and feed it some Greens.  Feeding a Chocobo greens will
 raise their stats., which includes how friendly they are (which affects
 how well you can control them).  Although they're expensive, Sylkis
 Greens (which are available from the Chocobo Sage) are the best ones you
 can get.  Even a measly 20 Sylkis Greens will have a big impact on how
 controllable your mount is.

 Another benefit of racing your Chocobo is that it's class will go up
 after you win enough races, as shown below:

  - As a C rank racer, take 1st place in 3 races to go up to B rank.
  - As a B rank racer, take 1st place in 3 races to go up to A rank.
  - As a A rank racer, take 1st place in 3 races to go up to S rank.

 The highest rank you can attain is "S" rank.  Not only can you earn
 better prizes (or higher amounts of GP) depending on your rank, but if
 you're trying to breed chocobos (see section K), you'll find that it's
 easier to get a rare color if both parents are of a high class.  Also,
 if you decide to bet on Chocobos, you will now be able to bet on the
 S-rank races.

 If you win ten S-rank races using the same Chocobo, you will receive a
 prize packet from Ester which contains the following: Sprint Shoes,
 Precious Watch, Cat's Bell, Chocobracelet, and a Counter Attack materia.

 Another good reason to participate in the races is that you run the
 chance of winning a rare item.  Some items can only be gotten through
 racing such as the following:

 Prize List              Class

 Finally, if you have Tifa or Cid in your party, they will randomly ask
 to be the jockey for your next race.

 (R)  Huge Materia at the Underwater Reactor
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Items in this section:
  - God's Hand, Battle Trumpet, Scimitar, Leviathan Scales (a Key Item).

 Items to steal:
  - Shinra Alpha (from Underwater MP and Captain).

 Items to morph:
  - Guide Book (from Ghost Ship).

 Enemy Skills in this section:
  - Matra Magic (from Death Machine).

 Return to Junon and take the elevator at the west end of town up to the
 upper level of the city.  Here, head west.  In case you're wondering
 about the scene with Cloud in which he asks if something is missing,
 he's referring to the fact that the Sister Ray (Junon's large cannon)
 is now gone.

 Head west until you reach the path that runs north-south (it's right
 in the middle of the city, in the passage beneath the trolleys).  Head
 south until you reach the end of the passage, then take the door on the
 northwest wall.

 Inside the elevator, you'll have to fight two Submarine Crew enemies.
 It will then take you down to the Submarine Dock area.  Once you leave
 the elevator, you'll have to fight two more enemies.  From here, just
 follow the paths until you reach a Save Point.  Now ride the elevator
 down to reach the Underwater Reactor.  If you head north, you'll reach
 a large glass tube that leads to the reactor.  I suggest hanging around
 here until you encounter a Ghost Ship enemy, which you can morph into
 the Guide Book.

 Once you're inside the reactor, press the red button on the west end of
 the screen to make the chamber descend.  Then continue following the
 path until you arrive at another Save Point.

 In the next area, there is a guard wandering around.  If you bump into
 him or talk to him, he'll attack you.  However, you may want to fight
 him, since if you don't, you'll end up fighting all three guards at
 the same time from both sides.  If you kill the guard first, then
 you fight the other two in a standard battle.  Beyond them are two
 more Shinra soldiers you must fight.

 If you keep heading left, you'll run into Reno, who will promptly force
 you into a boss battle.

                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Underwater Reactor
                Notes:      Part of Carry Armor.

 Carry Armor consists of a base unit and two arms.  The base can inflict
 heavy damage with it's "Lapis Laser" attack, which costs MP to use.
 Therefore, all you have to do is use Magic Hammer on the base two times
 to take it out of the picture.  If you don't know Magic Hammer, then
 cast Big Guard or MBarrier on your party to reduce the damage taken from
 the laser.

 The arms of Carry Armor can pick up a person using the "Arm Grab."  A
 caught ally will take a set amount of damage each time Carry Armor is
 attacked (so even hitting it for 100 damage or 4000 damage will not
 have much of an effect on how much damage the caught character takes).
 However, a caught ally can be hit multiple times if you attack the boss
 with a group spell or attack (i.e., if you cast Ultima on it, your
 opponent would get hit three times if both arms were left).  The only
 way for a caught party member to escape is if they die or the arm is
 destroyed.

 Carry Armor can hold two characters at a time.  If it picks up your
 last remaining character (for example, if one player is dead and it is
 holding the other two), then the game will end.
  
 Since this enemy is weak against Lightning, you can pair Elemental and
 Lightning or Ramuh on your weapon to inflict more damage.  However, the
 easiest way to kill it is to use the Magic Breath skill repeatedly.  It
 does a huge amount of damage and can kill the boss in only a few rounds.
 If you don't have this skill, then use Ultima, Bolt3, Trine, or
 Aqualung (in that order of preference).
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 After you defeat Carry Armor, head to the west and open the chest to
 get the Battle Trumpet.  Then head over to the submarine where all the
 Shinra soldiers are.  There's a chest near the stairs which contains
 the Scimitar, and another container to the west which holds a Key Item
 (the Leviathan Scales).  Now, fight off the soldiers.  Inside the sub,
 you'll have to fight three more Submarine Crew enemies, this time on
 either side.  After they're dead, you can always make use of the Save
 Point if you want.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Also, note that the God's Hand, like Vincent's Sniper CR, will give
 Tifa an accuracy rating of 255.  This means that you can give her
 the Deathblow materia, and she will never miss with it.  
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 Once you go into the front area of the submarine, you'll have the option
 to fight (the top choice), or take prisoner (the bottom choice) the
 Shinra troops you find there.  The only real benefit to fighting them
 is that you can steal a Shinra Alpha from the Captain.  If you take them
 hostage, they'll just stand aside and let you do as you please (and as
 far as I can tell, they stay in the sub for the rest of the game, oddly
 enough).

 Anyway, once you're in control of Cloud, examine the captain's chair.
 You'll have the option to learn how the submarine is piloted (top), sit
 in the seat (middle), or do nothing (bottom option).  Once you sit in
 the seat, you have the option to display the controls again (the top
 option), or take control of the sub (bottom option).

 Your goal in this part of the game is to find and sink the red Shinra
 submarine.  To sink it, you have to hit it with torpedoes until it is
 destroyed.  You're given ten minutes to do so.  Here are your ship's
 controls:

                Up                      Descend
                Down                    Ascend
                Left                    Rotate left
                Right                   Rotate right
                Square button           Launch torpedo
                Triangle button         Increase speed
                X button                Decrease speed
                R1 button               High overhead view on/off
                R2 button x1            Low overhead view
                R2 button x2            Cockpit view
                R2 button x3            Distant view
                R2 button x4            Return to normal view

 The gauge on the far right is your speed gauge, which you can increase
 or decrease by using the Triangle and X buttons, respectively.  Unless
 you set your speed to 000, you will always remain moving.  Going below
 000 makes you move backwards, while going above 000 makes you go
 forward.  You can also press up or down to control your direction of
 travel.

 You can see enemy mines intermittently--they look like diamonds, and
 shown beneath them is a red column to give you a visual guide as to
 their depth.  A warning message will appear if you draw close to
 any obstacle (a cliff face, mine, or enemy submarine), and an alert
 message will appear if you get really close to an obstacle.  The only
 things that can hurt you are mines and enemy torpedoes, though, so
 don't worry about running into the walls.

 In addition to the red Shinra submarine, there are other yellow
 submarines.  You don't have to destroy them, but they will fire
 torpedoes at you, so you may want to attack them if only to protect
 yourself.

 Since the red submarine starts off directly in front of you, you can
 sink it in a matter of seconds by speeding after it and firing torpedoes
 into it repeatedly.

 If you manage to sink the red submarine, you will gain the use of
 the submarine you're in.  Moving it around is pretty simple:

 When surfaced --
                Left / Right            Move left or right
                Up / Down               Move forward or backward
                Circle button           Get off at a dock
                X button                Submerge

 When submerged --
                Left / Right            Turn to the left or right
                Up / Down               Descend or Ascend
                Circle button           Move forward
                X button                Surface
                                              
 Although the game instructs you to go to the Airport at Junon, you
 don't have to (although you get to see some FMV of the Gelnika taking
 off if you do).

 If you fail the submarine mission (by either time out, or if your sub
 is sunk), then Cloud will wake up on the beach, thanks to the efforts
 of Mr. Dolphin.  Since you need to get another submarine, take the
 elevator back up to Junon.  If you want to see some FMV of the Gelnika
 taking off, then go out to the Airport area.

 When you're done, return to the vertical passage bisecting the town
 and take the elevator down to the submarine dock.  Then talk to the
 two guards standing near the dog.  After defeating them, examine the
 dog, then go through the door.  In the next area, examine the dog to
 get it out of your way, then head north.  If you examine the dog
 again, you have the option to ignore it (top), or kidnap it (bottom
 option).

 Inside the sub, you'll be confronted by more Shinra troops.  You have
 the option to take them hostage (top choice), or not (bottom choice).
 Once you go to the front room, you're given the same choice (top option
 to not fight, bottom option to fight them).  Once you've made your
 choice, you'll be able to pilot their sub around.

 As far as I know, taking the soldiers or the dog as hostages has no
 effect on the game.  It's just for laughs (and boy does Cloud hate
 those Shinra dogs) ;)
                              

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (S)  Undersea Treasures / The Gelnika
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Oritsuru, Steal as well materia, Underwater materia, Huge materia
    (a Key Item), Key to Ancients (a Key Item), Heaven's Cloud,
    Megalixir x2, Escort Guard, Double Cut materia, Conformer,
    Spirit Lance, Outsider, Highwind manual, Hades materia.

 Items to steal:
  - Touph Ring (from Reno), Ziedrich (from Rude), Fire Armlet (from
    Unknown), Aurora Armlet (from Unknown 2), Bolt Armlet (from
    Unknown 3), Turbo Ether (from Poodler), Water Ring (from Serpent).

 Items to morph:
  - Power Source (from Unknown), Guard Source, (from Unknown 2),
    Magic Source (from Unknown 3), Luck Source (from Bad Rap),
    Speed Source (from Poodler).

 Enemy Skills in this section:
  - Aqualung (from Serpent).

 Now that you have a submarine, there are a couple of new things you can
 do:

  - You can visit Wutai and get some free items.
  - You can get the Underwater materia from Kalm Town.
  - You can get the Huge Materia from the sunken Shinra submarine.
  - You can get the "Key to Ancients."
  - You can visit Lucrecia's waterfall (to get there, you have to find
    a tunnel that leads inland, to the middle of the midwest continent).
    You can find out what to do there by referring back to section J.
  - You can visit a sunken Gelnika ship.
  - You can fight the Emerald Weapon.

 You can do these events in any order (they're all optional):


 ITEMS AT WUTAI
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Return to Wutai and go to the Da-chao Statues area.  Remember the cave
 where the blazing fires were?  You can use those Leviathan Scales you
 just got to put out the flames.  To get to the cave, take the path
 leading north from the main path, then follow it west and go north to
 reach the cave entrance.

 When you approach the flames, the message "`The Scale of the Sea God'
 shines" will appear.  This is another mistranslation (since the item
 was called that in the Japanese version only).  If you clear away the
 first two fires, you'll find a chest containing the Oritsuru.  When
 the southern bonfire is doused, you'll find the Steal as well materia
 lying on the ground.


 UNDERWATER MATERIA
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Return to Kalm Town and enter the house in the northeast corner of town
 (it's just east of the bar).  Inside, go to the second floor and talk to
 the man who is standing around.  He will offer to give you prizes in
 return for handing over certain items.  If you talk to him again, he'll
 offer to give you an Underwater materia in return for your Guide Book.
 If you want to trade, pick the top option.

 Although it's not really necessary, you can always go get more Guide
 Books and trade them for more Underwater materias, if you really want.
 The Underwater materia is used when fighting the Emerald Weapon, which
 we'll get to by the end of this section.  For now, let's make use of
 that submarine of yours.


 THE HUGE MATERIA
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 If you sunk the red Shinra sub, then you can find it in the sea and
 extract the Huge Materia it was carrying.  The sub is always located in
 the same place regardless of where you sunk it.  Pilot the sub over to
 where the weaponsmith's house is located at (it's on a peninsula south
 and slightly east of where the Gold Saucer stands).  If you look south
 from here, you'll see a chain of islands extending to the west (to where
 the Temple of Ancients stood).

 If you submerge and look around, you should find the remnants of the
 red submarine lying on the sea floor, against a cliff face.  Just touch
 it with your own sub to get the Huge Materia out.

 Note that if you were unable to sink the Shinra sub (and therefore ended
 up piloting a red submarine), then there will be no sunken ship to find
 and no Huge Materia to recover.


 KEY TO ANCIENTS
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 You won't need the Key to Ancients just yet, but since you have the sub,
 you might as well get it now.  Head north to Bone Village.  The bay
 south of the village is full of shallow water, but you can still get
 within sight of the dinosaur skull itself.  Now head northwest along
 the shallow water, until you reach an area where the shallows curve
 around you, and there are a series of small islands to the west.

 If you submerge here, you should be able to find a small tunnel in
 the cliff wall that leads east for a short distance.  At the end of
 the tunnel is a spiky object.  If you touch it with your sub, you
 will retrieve the Key to Ancients.


 LUCRECIA'S WATERFALL
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 You can reach this area using a colored Chocobo (see section J), but if
 you don't have one, you can use the submarine to get there.  The passage
 leading to the waterfall is just southwest of where you found the path
 leading to the Key to Ancients.  It's in the area where there is a river
 dividing two areas--to the west is the entrance to Mt. Corel, and to the
 east is a barren area with a cave entrance leading to where you got the
 HP<->MP materia.

 If you go to the river's mouth and submerge, you'll see a passage in
 the side of the wall which leads inland.  If you surface upon reaching
 the end of the tunnel, you'll find yourself in a lake near a waterfall.
 You can dock your submarine on the land to the west of the waterfall.
 For more information about what to do here, see section J.


 EXPLORING THE GELNIKA
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This isn't the same Gelnika that headed off to Rocket Town--it's another
 plane of the same make that crashed into the ocean.  To find it, return
 to the dock at Junon.  If you head due east, you'll see a peninsula
 jutting out at a right angle, running from west to east.  Go around the
 peninsula and make your way to the dock near the Gold Saucer, inside
 the little bay created by the peninsula.

 If you submerge here, you'll see a plane lying on the sea floor.  Just
 touch it with the sub to enter it.  There is a Save Point to the west
 of the entrance, and I suggest you use it--the enemies in the Gelnika
 are very powerful.  Near the Save Point is a chest containing the
 Heaven's Cloud.  Now go into the door north of the entrance.  In here,
 head north and then go east until you reach a treasure chest.  Inside
 is a Megalixir.  Now go back to the door and go east to reach a chest
 holding an Escort Guard.
          
 Then go down the stairs and head to the northeast corner of the room.
 There is a pink orb lying on the ground (obscured by the chest on the
 upper level), that turns out to be a Double Cut materia.  Now go to
 the northwest corner of the room--there is a chest that is hidden
 by the reverse L-shaped pipe hanging overhead.  Inside the chest is
 the Conformer.

 Now return to the main hall and head west into the next room.  You'll
 run into Reno and Rude here.  
 
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Turks:Reno
                LV: 42        XP:  10500     Steal:  Touph Ring
                HP: 15000     AP:  660       Morph:  <cannot>
                MP: 230       Gil: 9000      Leaves: <nothing>
                No Effect:  Gravity, Invincibility, Sleep
                Ability:    [Attack], Neo Turk Light <causes Confuse>
                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Hallway (3rd encounter)
                Notes:      Since you fight both Turks at the same time,
                            the XP/AP/Gil amounts listed are for both of
                            them.

 Turks:Rude
                LV: 49        XP:  10500     Steal:  Ziedrich
                HP: 20000     AP:  660       Morph:  <cannot>
                MP: 280       Gil: 9000      Leaves: Elixir
                No Effect:  Gravity, *Invincibility, Sleep*
                Ability:    Fire 2 
                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Hallway <in Gelnika>
                Notes:      Since you fight both Turks at the same time,
                            the XP/AP/Gil amounts listed are for both of
                            them.

 To take Rude out of the picture, use Magic Hammer on him three times.
 He'll just stand around for the rest of the match.  Reno is another
 story.  Make sure you have your two Ribbons equipped (and pair Mystify
 and Added Effect on the third person's armor), so that your party won't
 be confused by his Neo Turk Light.

 Beyond that, you can use Barrier + All or Big Guard to defend against
 physical attacks, and use White Wind to heal yourself.  You can do the
 most damage against the Turks with Ultima, but Magic Breath and
 Aqualung also work very well (I prefer Aqualung since it uses much
 less MP than Magic Breath).  If you don't know any of those spells,
 then try Beta.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 Afterwards, continue north through the door to reach the cargo room.  In
 here, you can find a Megalixir in the chest near the west wall.  If you
 continue along the walkway as it leads to the east, you'll find a chest
 at the end which contains a Spirit Lance.

 Now go back to where the stairs were and take them down to the lower
 level.  If you head south, you'll see two chests--the one to the west
 contains the Outsider, while the eastern one holds the Highwind manual.

 Finally, if you go over to the ruined helicopter, you can see a red
 orb lying on the ground near it, almost obscured by the piece of
 machinery lying south of the helicopter.  If you examine it, you'll
 find that it is the Hades materia.

 Well, that's about all there is to do here.  If you haven't noticed it
 yet, you can steal and morph some very good items from the enemies in
 this area.


 THE EMERALD WEAPON
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 You may notice a large green enemy below the water, moving around in
 the "main" area of the sea (sometimes it also moves to the Gelnika's
 location and just sits there).  This is the Emerald Weapon.  It's an
 incredibly powerful boss (even the last boss of the game is weaker than
 it is), so I wouldn't recommend fighting it just yet.  If you bump into
 it and enter a battle, just run away.  Once you have better materia and
 equipment, we'll come back and take care of this guy.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (T)  Huge Materia at Rocket Town
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Venus Gospel.

 Items to steal:
  - Ziedrich (from Rude).

 Go to Rocket Town and make your way to the launch pad at the north
 end of town.  When you approach the stairs leading up to the rocket,
 you'll have to fight two Attack Squad enemies, then four more and
 a Senior Grunt before making your way to the rocket itself.  After
 beating these enemies, Cid will join your party, if he's not already
 a member.  Once he's joined, head up the ladder to run into Rude and
 two Attack Squad soldiers.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Turks:Rude
                LV: 42        XP:  3400      Steal:  Ziedrich
                HP: 9000      AP:  80        Morph:  <nothing>
                MP: 240       Gil: 3000      Leaves: Hi-Potion
                No Effect:  Gravity, Invincibility, Sleep
                Ability:    [Attack], Grand Spark, MBarrier, Bolt2,
                            Cure2
                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Rocket Launching Pad

 Once the Attack Squad enemies are dead, Rude will cast MBarrier on
 himself, then start using his Grand Spark attack repeatedly.  Whenever
 his life gets too low, he'll use Bolt2 on you, immediately followed by
 Cure2 on himself.  The easiest way to neutralize him is to use Magic
 Hammer three times to drain him of his MP before killing the Attack
 Squad enemies.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 After defeating Rude, go inside the rocket and defeat the Senior Grunt
 that's waiting for you.  Once you enter the control room, the rocket
 will take off, thanks to Palmer (who somehow survived getting hit by a
 truck back in Disc 1).

 Once you're in control of Cloud, head east, then climb up the ladder to
 where the Huge Materia is.  To get it, approach the control panel and
 examine it, then choose the top option ("Yes").  Cid will then explain
 how to enter the code.  If you don't get it right on the first try,
 you'll have 3 minutes to figure out the code, while Cid gives you some
 advice.  If you fail, the Huge Materia will be lowered into the floor
 and cannot be retrieved.

 If you figure out the password on the first try, Cid will point out
 that you had to have known it in advance :)  Anyway, the correct
 password is as follows:

  1st: Circle button, 2nd: Square button, 3rd: X button, 4th: X button

 You have to press the button once for each message box that comes up;
 you don't just tap them in all at once.

 Once you have the Huge Materia (or not), return to the control room
 and go south, back out to the hallway where you fought the Senior
 Grunt.  Continue south and climb down the ladder, then head south
 in the room with the oxygen tanks.  Shera will show up and help you
 out.  Then just follow her to the escape pod.

 Once you're back in the airship and in control of Cloud, just talk to
 the pilot to take control of the Highwind.

 Some of you might be thinking, "Hey, if I failed to gather all four
 Huge Materia, would it affect the Shinra's plan to destroy the
 Meteor?"  And the answer is in fact, no.  The Meteor will survive
 the impact of the rocket whether it contains four Huge Materia or
 none.  That's why it's in your best interest to collect them all.

 Before continuing on, you can get a new weapon by going to Rocket Town
 and talking to the old man who gave you the Yoshiyuki.  The third time
 you talk to him, he'll give you the Venus Gospel.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (U)  Return to Cosmo Canyon
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Bahamut ZERO materia.

 As Red XIII suggests, it's time to revisit Cosmo Canyon.  Make your way
 back to Bugenhangen's observatory and talk to him.  If you managed to
 collect any of the Huge Materia, Bugenhagen will let you store them
 here.

 Note that the Huge Materia you receive depend on how _many_ you were
 able to save, not _which_ ones you were able to save.  For example,
 the Huge Materia at the Underwater Reactor is red, and the one in Cid's
 rocket is blue.  However, if you failed to save the one from the
 Underwater Reactor, but get the one from the rocket, you will end up
 with the Huge Red Materia when you visit Cosmo Canyon.  This basically
 means that you have to have completed all four missions successfully if
 you want to get the Huge Blue Materia.

 So, you may ask, what's the point of collecting the Huge Materia?
 Well, if you master certain materia of the same color, then touch
 the corresponding Huge Materia, you will give up your mastered materia
 in return for one Master materia.  For example, if you mastered all
 sixteen Summon materia, then touched the Huge Red Materia, you would
 lose all your masters but receive one "Master Summon" materia.

 Master materia have all of the abilities of the materia you gave up in
 order to get them.  For example, you can cast any spell using the
 Master Magic materia.  You can earn as many Master materia as you want,
 though you must re-master all the materia of that type (i.e., all Magic
 Materia or all Summon materia) again in order to get another one.  At
 least you won't have to re-collect those materia, since you get a new
 "copy" of your mastered materia when it is mastered.  You still have to
 earn a lot of AP, though, since copied materia start off at their
 initial AP levels.
        
 Here is a list of the mastered materia required in order to get a
 Master materia:

   Master Command
     - Deathblow, Manipulate, Mime, Morph, Sense, Steal, Throw.
       
   Master Magic
     - All 21 Magic materia.

   Master Summon
     - All 16 Summon materia.

 There are no "Master Support" or "Master Independent" materias.

 If you look through your menu, you'll notice that while you should
 have enough Command materia to earn a Master Command materia, you
 are still missing one Summon materia, Bahamut Zero.  Luckily for
 you, you can get it right now.  Go over to the Huge Blue Materia and
 examine it, then pick the top option <"Get closer...">.  If you have
 the Bahamut and Neo Bahamut materia, then you will recieve the
 "Bahamut ZERO" materia.

 Don't worry about trying to earn Master materia as soon as possible;
 chances are, you still have yet to master all of your existing materia.

 Anyway, as Bugenhagen suggested, your next goal should be the
 Forgotten City.  To go back down, examine any of the Huge Materia and
 choose the third option ("Go back down").  Once you leave, you'll find
 yourself on the Highwind.  Talk to the pilot in the command room to
 take off.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (V)  Diamond and Ultimate Weapons
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Ultima Weapon, Final Attack materia, Autograph, Combat Diary,
    Gambler.

 Items to steal:
  - Rising Sun (from Diamond Weapon), Circlet x? and/or Reflect Ring x?
    (from Ultimate Weapon).

 Enemy Skills in this section:
  - Shadow Flare (from Ultimate Weapon).

 You will need the "Key to Ancients" for this section (to get it, refer
 to section S).  It's located in an underwater tunnel just to the
 southwest of Bone Village (which means you will need the submarine in
 order to get to it).

 Once you reach the Forgotten City, go to the area where the paths split
 off in three directions and take the west path.  Follow it to the next
 area,then make your way north to the building, then head east into the
 cavern.  Make your way to the large crystal in the center of the room
 by heading east.  There is an entrance in the wall that leads to a
 staircase.  Just go down the staircase and head along the outcropping
 to where Bugenhagen is waiting for you.

 After he talks to you, Bugenhagen will use the Key to Ancients to
 create a waterfall around the crystal (assuming you have it).  Once
 you're in control of Cloud, approach the crystal again.  After that
 event is over, leave the Forgotten City.  when you try to get back
 into the Highwind, the Diamond Weapon will show up.  Fly to Midgar,
 wait for the Weapon to get onto dry land, and then walk up to it in
 order to fight it.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Diamond Weapon
                LV: <unknown> XP:  35000     Steal:  Rising Sun
                HP: 30000     AP:  3500      Morph:  <unknown>
                MP: <unknown> Gil: 25000     Leaves: <unknown>
                Weakness:   Lightning
                No Damage:  Gravity, Poison
                Ability:    [Blue Shot], [Foot Stomp], Countdown,
                            Diamond Flash <causes Silence>. 
                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Midgar Area
                Notes:      Cannot sense.

 The Diamond Weapon has two defense "modes."  In one mode, it takes no
 damage from physical attacks (including physical attack spells like
 Goblin Punch or ????).  In the other mode, it takes no damage from magic
 attacks (including Enemy Skills and Summon Magic).  It will always start
 off in the "immune to physical attacks mode."  There's no way to tell
 when it switches modes--your method of attack will simply no longer
 inflict any damage.

 When the Diamond Weapon is immune to magic, all you can really do is go
 at it with physical attacks and Limit Breaks.  You can always use Hypers
 on your characters to get your Limit Break gauges to fill up faster.
 When the Diamond Weapon is immune to physical attacks, there are a
 number of spells you can use on it that will work well, including
 Comet2, Hades, Ultima, Bolt3, Comet, Alexander, Ramuh, Tornado, Quake3,
 Ice3, Magic Breath, Trine, Aqualung, and Flare (listed in order of
 preference).

 However, if you've learned Bolt3, there is an easy method to kill the
 Diamond Weapon in only a few rounds.  Cast Reflect + All on all members,
 then cast Bolt3 + All on your party.  It will bounce back and hit the
 boss three times for about triple the normal damage.  You can then
 continue to cast Bolt3 on your party until the Diamond Weapon dies.
 It helps if the Bolt3 caster has high magic power, so give him any Magic
 Plus materia you may have.  If you have a second materia orb that can
 cast Bolt3, you can always pair it with MP Turbo to increase the
 magic's effectiveness.
 
 The boss's two main attacks are not much to write home about.  The first
 is a foot stomp, which will hit for full damage even if you cast Barrier
 or Big Guard on yourself.  The second attack is a blue ball of light
 which hits for Fire damage.  By now, you should have enough equipment to
 defend each party member against this (i.e. equip them with a Fire Ring,
 Fire Armlet, Tetra Elemental, etc.).  Optionally, you can pair Elemental
 and Fire, Ifrit, or Phoenix on their armor.  If you don't have the
 proper defenses, then you can always resort to using Mbarrier, which
 will reduce the damage of the light blast.
                                   
 When the Diamond Weapon is low on life, it may begin to count down.
 Once it reaches zero, it will use it's "Diamond Flash" attack, which
 inflicts a great deal of damage on all members and causes "Silence."
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 After the battle, you'll be told to visit the crater on the northern
 continent (where Gaea's Cliff was).  After going there, you will be
 able to re-enter Midgar simply by flying over it.  However, you may
 not want to do that just yet.

 For one thing, Midgar city is the last area in Disc 2, so if there was
 anything you wanted to do before the next disc (such as Yuffie's sub-
 quest), you may want to do that now.  Since you can get a very good
 weapon from it, we're going to take a moment to go after the Ultimate
 Weapon.

 Get in the Highwind and fly to Junon.  Just east of the city is a
 large lake (this appeared in Disc 2, after you acquired the airship).
 However, the Ultimate Weapon will now be hovering above the lake.  If
 you run into it, you'll get to fight it.
              
 After fighting the Ultimate Weapon for a while, it will fly away.  If
 you follow it, you'll see that it moves around at random.  If you ram
 into it four to five times with your airship (the number varies), then
 it will set a course to a particular destination and fly there.  Upon
 arriving, it hangs in the air waiting for you to touch it, at which
 point a battle will ensue.

 Here are the following locations where you can fight it.  Note that
 what you can steal from the Ultimate Weapon depends on where you
 fight it:

  Location              Battle Type             Item to steal
  -----------------------------------------------------------
  Junon Area (at lake)  Aerial battle           Circlet
  Mideel                Aerial battle           Circlet
  Mt. Nibel             Aerial battle           Circlet
  Mt. Corel             Aerial battle           Circlet
  Gongaga Village       Ground battle           Reflect Ring
  Fort Condor           Ground battle           Reflect Ring
  Midgar City           Ground battle           Reflect Ring
  Northern Crater       Ground battle           Reflect Ring
  Cosmo Canyon          Aerial battle           Reflect Ring
  Cosmo Area            Aerial battle (final)   --

 If it flies to Midgar City, then you will end up parachuting into the
 city (unless you are in Disc 3 or if you are in Disc 2 and haven't yet
 gone to the Northern Crater after defeating the Diamond Weapon).  To
 get around this, you can always save your game after each encounter
 with the Ultimate Weapon, so that if it flies there, you can just
 reset and try again.  You could try chasing it around before visiting
 the Northern Crater, but since that is another one of it's destinations,
 you'd have to go through that scene and you'd still run the risk of it
 flying to Midgar later on.

 Depending on the location you are at, you may have to fight it while
 it is on the ground or hovering in mid-air.  The following statistics
 are for the Ultimate Weapon during these battles:

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Ultimate Weapon
                LV: *60*      XP:  0         Steal:  (see above)
                HP: 100000    AP:  0         Morph:  <cannot>
                MP: 400       Gil: 0         Leaves: <unknown>
                Will Miss:    Earth  <mid-air battles only>
                No Effect:    Water  <mid-air battles only>
                              Gravity
                Ability:      Ultima Beam, [Bolt Ball], [Claw Swipe],
                              Quake2
                Manipulate:   <cannot>
                Location:     <varies>
                Notes:        Cannot sense.

 The Ultima Weapon's most potent attack is the "Ultima Beam", which can
 do a hefty amount of damage.  However, you can get around this by
 pairing a "non-elemental" materia to an Elemental materia and putting
 the two on your armor.  The following materia can be used in such a way:

                Ultima          FullCure        Contain
                Destruct        Time            Comet
                Barrier         Exit            Transform
                Mystify         Seal            Revive
                Heal            Restore         Knights of Round
                Bahamut ZERO    Hades           Neo Bahamut
                Kjata           Bahamut         Odin

 You should have three Elemental materia at this point, so just pair
 them up with any of the above materia and put them on your character's
 armor.

 The Ultimate Weapon's other attacks are not much to speak of.  It's
 Bolt Ball attack is Fire-based, which means you can absorb it using
 any number of items (Fire Armlets, Fire Rings, Tetra Elementals, etc.)
 If you fight it on the ground, it can also cast Quake2 (which is
 another reason to wear a Tetra Elemental).  While grounded, it also
 has a claw swipe attack which cannot be defended against, even if you
 cast Barrier or Big Guard on your party.

 If you are unable to protect your party against the Ultima Beam or the
 Bolt Ball attack, at least cast Big Guard or MBarrier, which will lessen
 the damage inflicted.

 Alternatively, you can use Magic Hammer on it four times to drain it of
 all it's HP.  Since the Ultima Beam and Bolt Ball cost MP to use, the
 Ultimate Weapon will be completely unable to attack during an aerial
 battle (and is reduced to using it's claw swipe during a ground battle).
                      
 If you are fighting the Ultima Weapon on the ground, you can use Earth
 attacks on it, but if it is hanging in the air, such attacks will miss.
 When in the air, your physical attacks will miss unless your character
 has a long-range weapon or has the Long Range materia equipped.  You
 cannot steal from this enemy unless you have the Long Range materia
 equipped, as well.

 As for attacking it, spells like Comet2, Flare, Ultima, Tornado, Magic
 Breath, Break, Freeze, Comet, Fire3, Quake3, Bolt3, Ice3, and Beta all
 do a fair amount of damage (listed in order of preference).

 The Ultimate Weapon's HP amount is carried over from battle to battle.
 After doing enough damage, it will fly to Cosmo Canyon for the final
 encounter (you don't have to ram into it for it to do this).  I would
 recommend saving your game before you fight it:

 The Ultimate Weapon's HP depends on how much damage you inflicted
 on it during the previous battles.  It will usually have around
 15000-20000 HP.

 Basically, this battle is just like any of the previous ones (see the
 above entry on the Ultimate Weapon for more information).  The only
 difference is that once you kill it, the Ultimate Weapon will cast
 Shadow Flare on the character who delivers the fatal blow.  Therefore,
 try to keep at least two characters alive before killing it.  Or, use
 Magic Hammer to drain it of MP, in which case it will be unable to
 cast Shadow Flare in the first place (in fact, draining it of MP leaves
 it completely incapable of attacking you for the rest of the battle).

 In order to get Shadow Flare onto all of your Enemy Skill materia,
 give them all to one character (unless you're in Disc 3 and have
 already gotten Shadow Flare--if you have it on one materia, the others
 won't learn the spell even if it hits you).  Then have that person
 deliver the final blow.  You can use MBarrier or Big Guard to reduce
 the amount of damage Shadow Flare inflicts.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 After the Ultimate Weapon dies, it will fall to the ground and explode.
 This has the side effect of creating a path to the Ancient Forest (see
 Section K for details).  Formerly, it could only be reached via a
 colored Chocobo.

 Furthermore, once the Ultimate Weapon is dead, the Ruby Weapon will
 appear in the Corel Desert (where the Gold Saucer is).  You can see
 it's head sticking out of the sand.  Like the Emerald Weapon, however,
 it is incredibly powerful.  We'll get around to defeating it in a later
 section.

 Another advantage of killing the Ultimate Weapon is that once you've
 collected the Omnislash manual, W-Summon materia, and Ultima Weapon, you
 can participate in the Special Battle at the Battle Square in the Gold
 Saucer.  Just go up to the receptionist and talk to her, and she'll
 recommend it to you.  These are the enemies you will fight:

        Sea Worm, Ho-chu, Unknown 3, Serpent, Wolfmeister,
      Behemoth, Maximum Kimaira, Prod Clod (with Jamar Armor).

 The prize you receive for completing the special battle is as follows:

    1st time you win:       Final Attack materia
    2nd time you win:       Autograph
    3rd time you win:       Combat Diary
    4th time you win:       Gambler
    5th time and so on:     Autograph, Combat Diary, Gambler, or Ribbon

 Aside from the Final Attack materia and Ribbon, the other items have
 no purpose.  They're just useless prizes, like the Masamune, 1/35
 soldier, Tissue, etc.  It may be tempting to play the Special Battle
 over and over in order to win a Ribbon, but the chance of them
 showing up seems pretty low, IMHO (did _a lot_ of battling before
 finally getting one).

 (W)  Return to Midgar City
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                           
 Items in this section:
  - Elixir x4, Megalixir, Aegis Armlet, Starlight Phone, Elixir,
    Max Ray, Power Souce x2, Guard Source, Mind Source x2, Magic Source,
    W-Item materia, Pile Bunker, Master Fist, Glow Lance, Speed Source,
    HP Shout, Behemoth Horn, Ragnarok, Mystile, Missing Score.
             
 Items to steal:
  - Touph Ring (from Reno), Minerva Band (from Elena), Ziedrich (from
    Rude).

 To re-enter Midgar, just fly over it in the Highwind.  You'll have a
 chance to change your party members before leaping off the deck of the
 airship.  Once you land, follow Cait Sith into the alleyway.  There,
 you can find a Save Point to use.  Talk to Cait Sith, and he'll open
 up the trapdoor.  Then climb down to the underground area.

 Here, climb down the ladder and follow the sloping path east.  When
 it turns north, follow it to the wall and run west to reach a chest
 containing an Elixir.  Then head all the way to the east to find a
 chest holding a Megalixir.  Now return to the entrance and go down
 the stairs.  Climb down the ladder to a new area.  Here, go west and
 climb the ladder in the back of the room.  It leads up to a treasure
 chest back in the first area which contains an Aegis Armlet.

 Now go back down and head all the way to the east.  You'll reach a
 platform that will fall when you step on it (there's no away around
 this).  Once you land, head west and climb up the ladder.  It leads
 to a chute that deposits you in a new area.  Here, head west and open
 up the chest you find to receive a Starlight Phone.  Then head east
 and open the chest near the ladder to get an Elixir.  Now go down the
 ladder and walk east to jump down onto the lip of the chute labled
 "42."  Walk into it to reach another area.

 Go west and climb up the ladder.  At the top, there is a chest to the
 west which holds the Max Ray.  Now go back and go down the chute, so
 that you're back at the area where you got the Starlight Phone.  Press
 to the west to jump back onto the platform.  Climb back up to where
 the chute labled "12" is, and go up the nearby stairs.  This leads to
 a Save Point.  West of it is a crawlway that leads to a tunnel.

 Here, you have the option of going north or south.  If you go south,
 you can get several "Source" items and the W-Item materia, but then
 you'll have to a ton of backtracking.  If you want to get the W-Item
 materia without doing all that work, just wait until you're able
 to return to Bone Village in Disc 3.  If you didn't get the W-Item
 materia in Midgar, you will be able to dig it up there.

 Anyway, if you want to get all the items, start heading south.  The
 screens will repeat a couple of times, and you will run into some of
 your party members (depending on who is in your party).  Eventually, in
 one of the overhead scenes (where you can see the passages branching
 off), you'll see a treasure chest near the southwest area of the screen.
 Inside is a Power Source.  In the next overhead area, there is a chest
 right where the paths split.  Inside of it is a Guard Source.

 In the next overhead area, there are two chests, one containing a Mind
 Source and the other a Magic Source.  Beyond it is the end of the
 tunnel.  Here, there is a W-Item materia lying in the east corner of
 the screen, and a Save Point in the west corner.  Now go back north,
 taking the east passage each time (all the west paths are dead ends).  

 Once you return to the section of the tunnel where you first arrived
 (the area with the ladder on the west wall), head north to run into
 the Turks.  If you completed Yuffie's sub-quest (see Disc 1, Section V),
 then you will have the option to fight them or not.  If you didn't do
 the sub-quest, then you have no choice but to fight them.

                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Winding Tunnel

 Before the battle begins, make sure you have two Ribbons equipped, to
 counteract Elena's Charm attack.  You can equip anti-fire items (like
 Fire Armlets or Tetra Elementals) to absorb the damage from her Fire
 Swath attack, but it's not that damaging anyway (and you'll be using
 Big Guard in battle anyway).

 Also, the Turks can do a lot of damage with their physical attacks,
 so make sure characters with long range weapons are in the back row
 (or give someone the Long Range materia and put them in the back row).

 The first thing you want to do is cast Big Guard on yourself.  This is
 because Barrier will reduce damage from any of the Turks' physical
 attacks, as well as Reno's Electroprod and Elena's bomb and Fire Swath
 attacks.  MBarrier will reduce damage from Reno's Turk Light and Rude's
 Grand Spark.  Plus, it never hurts to have your whole party in Haste.
 The next thing to do is cast Slow + All on the Turks, as well as Bad
 Breath or Hades (since you can poison all three members).

 Each Turk is resistant to a particular type of elemental attack.  The
 best way around this is to use attacks that don't use those elements,
 such as Alexander or any of the Bahamut summons.  Magic spells like
 Ultima, Quake3, and Aqualung can also be used.  Don't bother with
 Typhoon, Kjata, or Magic Breath, as these will heal all three Turks. 
 
 Normally, Reno and Rude are in the back row, and Elena is in front.
 However, if you attack Elena, she will respond by moving into the
 back row, which places Reno and Rude in front as a result (even
 though she's the only character moving around).

 Finally, note that what kind of award you get is determined by
 which Turk you kill first.  If you manage to kill all three of them
 at once (say, by reducing their life all to the same amount, then
 casting a group spell that does more damage than that amount), then
 you will get the combined totals, which in this case adds up to
 16400 XP, 1850 AP, 15000 gil, and two Elixirs.  If you killed Elena
 first, then you would recieve 6400 XP, 800 AP, 7000 gil, and no
 items.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 After defeating the Turks, head north.  You'll reach an area where the
 path splits.  Take the east path, and continue along it until you
 reach another area where the path splits.  Here, take the west path.
 It leads to a dead end, but there is a ladder on the west wall that
 you can climb up.  It leads to the Shinra HQ.  Head north to find a
 Save Point.  Now go north into the building.

 Here, if you missed the second Turtle's Paradise flyer, you can find it
 on the message board at the northeast end of the floor.  Now take the
 stairs up to the second floor.  If you go into the Accessories Shop in
 the northeast corner of the screen, you can open up the chests inside
 the shop to find a Pile Bunker and Master Fist.

 Now, take the elevator up to the 59th floor, and go into the elevator
 on the east wall.  Take it up to the 63rd floor.  The walls that used
 to be here are gone, so make your way to the room northwest of the
 room with the computer.  In here is an item bag holding a Glow Lance.

 Now go up to the 64th floor.  Go over to the vending machine in the
 northwest corner of the center room.  If you put money in here the
 last time you were here (in Disc 1), then you can examine the machine,
 choose the top option (to bang on it), and you'll get a Mind Source
 and a Speed Source.  Then go into the locker room to the north.  If
 you examine the back row of lockers, you'll find one that contains
 the HP Shout weapon.

 There's one item left to collect, but getting  it can be pretty
 boring.  Go back to floor 59 and go through the door on the west
 wall to reach a stairwell.  If you really want to go all the way
 back down, you can find the Behemoth Horn on one of the landings,
 one screen above the landing where you found the Elixir (which will
 still be there if you didn't get it the first time around).

 Once you're done looting the Shinra building, go back down into
 the underground tunnel.  Head south (ignoring the path leading to
 the east), until you reach another split passage where a tunnel
 goes to the west.  It will lead outside.  Here, climb up the wall
 and try to head north--you'll be intercepted by a boss.

                Ability:    Materia-jammer
                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Part of Proud Clod.

 Start the battle by casting Big Guard or Barrier + All on your party.
 Barrier will reduce the damage from every one of the Proud Clod's
 attacks except the Beam Cannon (which can be reduced via MBarrier).
 You'll know when a Beam Cannon attack is coming because the boss will
 kneel over.  It usually starts doing this when it's life has been
 reduced to half or less.

 If you can't use MBarrier or Big Guard on yourself, then just use
 Magic Hammer on the Proud Clod for three rounds, since it requires
 MP to fire the Beam Cannon.  The Jamar Armor has an attack called
 "Materia-jammer," which you think would seal your Materia or something
 like that.  In fact, it doesn't seem to do anything at all.

 As for attacking the boss, these spells work well: Flare, Tornado,
 Ultima, Break, Freeze, Comet, Magic Breath, Quake3, Fire3, and Ice3
 (in order of damage inflicted).  Finally, note that you will gain more
 XP/AP/Gil by defeating the Jamar Armor before killing Proud Clod
 (the total is 15000 XP, 2500 AP, and 20000 gil).
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 After the Proud Clod is defeated, head north.  There are two chests to
 the east which contain an Elixir and a Mystile.  There is also a Save
 Point you can use.  If Barret isn't in your party, make sure he is a
 member before continuing.  Once he's joined, go up the stairs.  If he's
 not in your party, you can find Vincent on the first landing.  On the
 second landing you will find a chest containing the Missing Score, but
 ONLY if Barret is in your current party.  If he isn't, no matter how
 hard you look, you will not be able to find the chest.

 Once you reach the top of the cannon and head east, you'll encounter
 Hojo, who will fight you.

 Hojo will begin by using the Capsule ability to summon "Sample" monsters
 to aid him.  To get around that, simply cast Big Breath, which will put
 both monsters to sleep.  Or, use Frog Song twice, or Sleepel + All.  You
 can then concentrate on attacking Hojo, who is a sitting duck.  Don't
 forget, if you kill off his monsters, he will simply create more of
 them.

                Location:   Part of Helletic Hojo.

 You have several options when fighting Helletic.  One is to concentrate
 on killing the main body.  Another one is to kill both hands (although
 this takes longer because they have more combined HP than Helletic, and
 he can revive either of them).  Doing this will kill off the main body,
 as well.  The final option is to damage all body parts at once by using
 group effect spells, like Magic Breath, Beta, and Aqualung.

 I prefer the last method, as this will result in the Right Arm getting
 killed off frequently, giving you some time before it comes back
 (although Hojo can revive it in the round following it's death).
 This is also useful because you don't have to worry about the Right
 Arm using Confu all the time, which can really be detrimental to your
 party if you have any powerful attackers in your group.  Use White Wind
 to restore lost HP and to heal status ailments.  You can use Big Guard
 to defend against physical attacks, as well as to reduce the
 effectiveness of Bio Gas.

 Hojo's final and easiest form.  Although it's pricey, you can always
 cast Resist on anyone who doesn't have a Ribbon in order to defend
 against Hojo's Combo attack.  Or, give someone a Headband or Fairy
 Ring, so that at least one character cannot be put to sleep.  You use
 Echo Screens to cure a character who has been silenced; otherwise, use
 White Wind to remove status ailments and keep your life up.  If you
 use spells on Hojo, he'll counter with the aforementioned "Silence,"
 so you may want to stick with physical attacks (unless your magic-user
 has a Ribbon equipped or has been Resisted).
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 With Hojo dead, you've completed Disc 2.  You're almost there; there's
 only one disc left.


 ========================================================================
 3. DISC 3 WALKTHROUGH
 ========================================================================

 Please note that any references to section letters are referring to this
 section only.  If I'm referring to a section from the previous part of
 the walkthrough, I will write, "Section C, Disc Two" or something along
 those lines.  Therefore, if you see a note like "refer to section B,"
 then I am referring to Section B in the Disc Three Walkthrough only.
  
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (A)  Things To Do 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Limited Moon.

 You'll start out on the Highwind deck.  While you could continue on
 and explore the Northern Crater (which is the last level of the game),
 there are some other events you may want to do first.  Go back into
 the pilot's room and talk to the pilot.  Pick the top option to assume
 control of the Highwind.  You'll notice that your airship is now rocket-
 powered.

 Now that you're in Disc 3, a couple of new events are available to you.
 For one thing, you can now dig up "unretrievable" items from Bone
 Village that you might have missed the first time around, like the
 Phoenix or W-Item materia.

 You can also get a new weapon for Red XIII by returning to Cosmo Canyon.
 Put Red XIII in your party and talk to Bugenhagen, who you'll find lying
 upstairs on the couch in his observatory.  He will give you the Limited
 Moon.

    (both from Parasite), Angel's Whisper (from Pollensalta), Roulette
    (from Death Dealer), Shadow Flare and Pandora's Box (both from
    Dragon Zombie).


 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Please note:  There is a nasty glitch involving not being able to leave
 the Northern Cave after having entered it.  Make sure you've saved your
 game before going inside, as you may not be able to leave.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 To re-enter the Northern Crater, just fly the Highwind over the center
 of the crater and try to land (press the X button).  Once you land,
 climb down the ladder and head southwest.  In the next area, you can
 slide down the side of the crater by choosing the top option.

 Once you've reached the next area, head west.  There is a cave entrance
 here that you can enter to return to the Highwind (if you want to do
 this, go through the cave, then climb the strip of rock just east of
 the entrance).

 For now, continue west and open the chest, which holds a Save Crystal.
 Don't worry about the ground giving way as you continue--you can just
 hop over the gaps.  Further along the path is another chest containing
 a Guard Source.

 In the next area, head east and jump down the ledges to reach a chest
 which holds a Guard Source.  Continue south to reach another chest
 which contains a Mind Source.  At the bottom, head west and press the
 Circle button to climb up onto the ledge.  Move west and climb up the
 next two ledges, then head east to reach a chest which holds a Magic
 Source.  Now go back west and climb up the next two ledges.  Then go
 all the way to the east and climb up the tall ledge, then go west to
 reach a chest which contains an Elixir.  Then make your way west to
 the ledge in the northwest corner and climb up to reach a chest which
 holds a Power Source.  If you walk east from here, you'll move behind
 a wall of rock and can reach a glinting orb which is an HP Absorb
 materia.

 Now climb back down, head west, and climb up the ledge to reach the
 area where you first arrived.  To get back down, just head east again
 and go down the ledges.  At the southeast corner of the screen, just
 head south to reach the next area.

 Here, head east.  Cloud will fall down to another ledge.  Go west to
 find a chest which holds a Mind Source.  Then go back to the edge of
 the ledge, turn, and press the Circle button to jump to the ledge
 above the chest.  Run to the west and Cloud will drop down again.
 There's a nearby opening in the wall, so go inside.  In here is a
 chest containing a Megalixir.  Go back outside, jump onto the ledge,
 and run to the east.  Drop down by the chest you just opened, then
 continue east to drop down again.  Then, go inside the opening in
 the wall.  It leads to another ledge.  Drop off of it onto the
 ground, then head west, climbing up the ledges as you go.  If you
 run all the way to the west, you'll drop down to an area with
 another opening and a chest, which contains a Hero Drink.  After
 getting it, go in the opening.  It will take you past a chest which
 holds a Guard Source.  Further north is a chest containing a Power
 Source (you can reach it by going through the hole in the wall).

 Once you're back at the top, you can just go all the way to the east
 and work your way down, going east from the southern ledges instead
 of climbing up them.  This leads you to a final ledge that leads down
 to the next area, which is the first major junction point.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 In the next area, climb down the two stalagtites.  This is the area,
 btw, where the glitch occurs--you simply won't be able to climb back
 up the stalagtite, even if you press the Circle button to examine it.
 If this happens to you, there's really nothing you can do about it.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 Anyway, when you reach the bottom, you'll run into your teammates.
 From here on, there are multiple paths that you can take, and you can
 divide up your team and send them along the various paths.  What's
 more, your friends will find certain items to give to you depending
 on where you send them.  They actually take the items from the treasure
 chests, too, so if you go back and check out the path they took, you'll
 notice that chests are open / items are missing, etc.

 However, there is a trick that lets you collect the items on all three
 paths _and_ makes your friends collect items off one of the paths as
 well, so you're really getting more items than is possible to receive
 normally.  This is the method that we're going to use, so keep reading.
 If you want to see how the other routes work and what items your team
 members will give you depending on what choice you make, see Section C.
 
 Anyway, now that you're at the first junction, send everyone to the
 right, and send Cloud to the left.  Then head southwest to the next
 screen.  Here is a second junction.  Send Cloud to the upper path,
 then follow it northeast to the next area.
 
 In this area, jump down from the rock onto the root.  Then go south
 and east to the end of the root; you can jump onto the nearby rock
 ledge and go west to reach a chest holding a Magic Source.  Now go
 back to the entrance and head northeast along the root.  Cloud will
 run underwater and emerge on a root to the east.  From here, head west
 to reach a chest containing a Remedy.  Then head east and follow the
 path into the next area.

 Here, head north and then west to reach a chest containing a Vaccine.
 Now head east and follow the path as it curves up the side of the rock
 to the west, where there is a green orb lying on the ground.  This is
 the Shield materia.  If you attempt to head south from here, Cloud will
 run underwater to another area where a chest is, which contains an
 Imperial Guard.  Now head north to go back to where the Shield materia
 was, then climb down the rock and head east.  There's a treasure chest
 in the far corner which has a Hero Drink inside.  You can then exit
 this area by heading north and following the path as it curves east.

 In the next area, if you explore the upper area near the trees while
 going along the stone basin, you can find a W-Magic materia.  If you
 then go back and go down into the middle of the basin, you'll find a
 shining light here that you can walk through.  If you examine the
 ground in the middle of it, you'll find a Counter materia.  After
 getting it, continue west to the opening in the wall and go through
 it.

 This will deposit you in the final area.  Just north of you is a chest
 containing a Luck Source.  Get it but _don't_ go to the stairs at the
 west end of the room, or the trick to collect more items will not work.
 Instead, continue north through the opening in the northeast wall.

 Here, head east, then north to reach a chest containing a Turbo Ether.
 Go to the west and jump across the platforms as you head west.  You'll
 notice that as you're jumping, you'll approach a glowing orb that is
 floating in the air (it's hard to see due to the bright lights that are
 everywhere).  If you press the Circle button as you near it, you can
 grab the orb, which is the Mega All materia.  If you mess up and miss
 it, just jump back and try again.  Anyway, after getting the materia,
 continue west to reach a chest which holds a Speed Source.  Then go
 back east to where the chest with the Turbo Ether was.  Go up the
 stairs to the east and follow the path as it leads west, then east to
 a chest containing an X-Potion.  Then exit this area by heading north.
 
 In the next area, follow the path.  Now here, on the west side of the
 room, the background is glowing a bright green color.  If you look to
 the far southwest, you'll see a patch where the green light brightens
 into a white patch.  Floating up and down near the bottom of the white
 area is a Magic Counter materia.  Trust me, it is VERY difficult to see.
 Spotting the Mega All materia in the previous screen was much easier to
 do (since this materia is not darkly colored and is against a white
 background).

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 You may want to adjust the brightness on your screen if you can't see
 it (or just press Cloud up against that area while tapping the Circle
 button to search repeatedly until you grab the Magic Counter materia).
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 Anyway, in this area, there is also a Vaccine and a Turbo Ether you
 can pick up from two chests.  Climb up the spire in the middle of the
 room and keep following the path.  In the next area, you'll come across
 a chest with another X-Potion, and north of it is a chest holding a
 Remedy.  To the far east is a path that leads north to a chest with
 an Elixir inside.  After getting it, return to the center platform and
 go north.

 This will lead you back to the room where you chose to take the upper
 path originally.  Go north back to the original junction point, then
 head east until you reach the next area.  Here, follow the spiralling
 path down until you reach a gap in the floor.  Pick the top option to
 climb down to a new area.  Here, there is a chest to the west holding
 a Mystile, and an Elixir lying around to the east.  Follow the path
 behind it down to the ground floor.  There is a chest to the southeast
 which holds a Tetra Elemental, and to the north is a chest containing
 a Speed Source.  From here, go east, then north to reach a chest which
 has a Megalixir inside of it.  Now go back south a bit and follow the
 upper path east until you reach another chest holding a Megalixir.  Go
 back east and continue north to reach the next area.

 Here, follow the ribcage as it spirals around and down to the south.
 In the next area, head to the stairs to the west to meet up with your
 companions.  Since you sent them all along the right path (which you
 just cleared), they will give you some of the items you've already
 collected (such as another Mystile and Megalixir).

 At this point, there's not much else to do but beat the game.  If you
 want to go and do anything else out in the World Map (such as fighting
 the Weapons), now would be a good time to do it.  If you want to, you
 can use your Save Crystal here to make a Save Point (although I
 personally never have a use for it).

 If you want to finish up the game, just head south and choose the top
 option, then skip down to Section D for more information.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (C)  Northern Crater Cave Routes
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This section lists the various routes you can take after reaching the
 first "junction point" about halfway through the last level.  Note that
 if you send Yuffie on a path by herself, she won't have any items to
 give to you at the end.  You have to send someone with her so that they
 will "remind" her to hand over the item she's found.  Also note that
 nobody in your current party will have an item to give you once you
 reach the final area and meet up with your teammates.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 ROUTE 1 (LEFT/UP)
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 1. Cloud and all party members sent left.
 2. Everyone sent down, Cloud sent up.
    
 In this area, jump down from the rock onto the root.  Then go south
 and east to the end of the root; you can jump onto the nearby rock
 ledge and go west to reach a chest holding a Magic Source.  Now go
 back to the entrance and head northeast along the root.  Cloud will
 run underwater and emerge on a root to the east.  From here, head west
 to reach a chest containing a Remedy.  Then head east and follow the
 path into the next area.

 Here, head north and then west to reach a chest containing a Vaccine.
 Now head east and follow the path as it curves up the side of the rock
 to the west, where there is a green orb lying on the ground.  This is
 the Shield materia.  If you attempt to head south from here, Cloud will
 run underwater to another area where a chest is, which contains an
 Imperial Guard.  Now head north to go back to where the Shield materia
 was, then climb down the rock and head east.  There's a treasure chest
 in the far corner which has a Hero Drink inside.  You can then exit
 this area by heading north and following the path as it curves east.

 In the next area, make your way west down into the middle of the stone
 basin.  There is a shining light here that you can walk through, but
 if you examine the ground in the middle of it, you'll find a Counter
 materia.  After getting it, continue west to the opening in the wall
 and go through it.

 This will deposit you in the final area.  Just north of you is a chest
 containing a Luck Source.  Get it and continue west to the steps to
 meet your teammates.

 Items given to you by your friends:
  - Elixir (from Cid), Turbo Ether (from Tifa), Remedy (from Barret),
    Speed Source (from Red XIII), X-Potion (from Cait Sith),
    Mega All materia (from Vincent), Vaccine (from Yuffie).

 Enemies on this route:
  - Allemagne, Christopher & Gighee, Magic Pot, Mover, Master Tonberry.


 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 ROUTE 2 (LEFT/DOWN)
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 1. Cloud and all party members sent left.
 2. Everyone sent up, Cloud sent down.

 In this area, press down repeatedly to make Cloud leap down to the
 lower level.  If you go to the east, you can jump down to a lower
 ledge, then follow the ledges north to a chest which holds an Elixir.
 Then go back to the large ledge and head west to reach a chest which
 contains a Remedy.  Continue south and jump onto the small ledge to
 reach another chest holding an X-Potion, then continue southeast to
 the next area.

 Here, head south and jump down the two ledges to the floor.  To the
 west is a chest holding a Turbo Ether.  Now head east and follow the
 path as it curves north, to where another chest is at.  Inside is a
 Vaccine.  Follow the path as it spirals west and south.  There is a
 Magic Counter materia here, but it's floating in the white portion
 of that green light emanating from the background.  Just go to the
 far southwest and look carefully, using the Circle button to search.
 It's very hard to spot, and you may need to turn your brightness
 down in order to actually see the materia.

 Once you get it, follow the path to the next area.  Hop down the ledge
 to the west to reach a chest holding an X-Potion, then head west and
 follow the path back to the east and down the steps.  You'll find a
 chest containing a Turbo Ether.

 Now go west.  Here, there is a platform to the north and a materia
 orb floating in the air.  If you press up to jump onto the platform,
 Cloud will automatically jump onto it, then jump west to the next
 ledge.  In order to grab the materia, tap the Circle button as Cloud
 nears the materia.  If you mess up, you can always press right to
 jump back onto the platform and down, at which point you can turn
 around and try again.  Once you're able to grab the floating orb,
 you'll get the Mega All materia.

 To the west of the Mega All materia is a chest containing a Speed
 Source.  After getting it, go back to the chest where the Turbo Ether
 was and go south, then west across the gap and down to the next area.
 Here, go southeast to reach a chest holding a Luck Source.  Continue
 southwest to where the steps are, and the rest of your teammates will
 show up.

 Items given to you by your friends:
  - Imperial Guard (from Cid), Hero Drink (from Tifa), Vaccine (from
    Barret), Shield materia (from Red XIII), Remedy (from Cait Sith),

 1. Cloud sent right.
 2. All party members sent left.
                                                                
 Head east until you reach the next area.  Here, follow the spiralling
 path down until you reach a gap in the floor.  Pick the top option to
 climb down to a new area.  Here, there is a chest to the west holding
 a Mystile, and an Elixir lying around to the east.  Follow the path
 behind it down to the ground floor.  There is a chest to the southeast
 which holds a Tetra Elemental, and to the north is a chest containing
 a Speed Source.  From here, go west, then north to reach a chest which
 has a Megalixir inside of it.  Now go south just a bit and head west
 along the upper path, following it all the way west and up to a chest
 which holds a Megalixir.  Now go back east and continue north past the
 opened chest to reach the next area.

 Here, follow the ribcage as it spirals around and down to the south.
 In the next area, head to the east and open the chest to get the Luck
 Source, then head to the stairs to meet up with your companions.

                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Inside the Planet
                Notes:      The left tentacle of Jenova.

 Jenova can do a lot of damage with her tentacle attacks.  What's more,
 she can revive the tentacles if they are killed.  I recommend using
 Enemy Skills like Magic Breath, Beta, and Aqualung to damage multiple
 targets.  Then, use Shadow Flare on her body once the tentacles are
 dead.  Since they will be revived with only 1/4th their total HP in a
 few rounds, just use another group-effect skill (like Magic Breath) to
 kill them off again.
                                                      
 Once Jenova's life drops to around 1/6th, she will begin counting down
 from five.  If she reaches zero, she will cast Ultima on the party, then
 die.  However, you will gain no XP or AP if she dies in this manner.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 After defeating Jenova, you will have the chance to make another party
 to fight Sephiroth.  What's more, you may be able to assemble more than
 one team (you can assemble two or three teams).  How this works and
 what determines the number of teams you can make isn't really clear.
 It's been said that your total game time has something to do with this.
 With almost 98 hours on the clock, I was able to split into two
 groups no matter how many times I played.  It'd be interesting to hear
 if other people always got one or three teams and had a different time.
 Other people say that how long it takes you to defeat Jenova affects
 your teams, but I've beaten her both quickly and have taken my time
 and I still got the same result.

 When you're done assembling the team(s), choose the top option (let's
 go, everyone).  If you choose the bottom option, you can re-assemble
 both teams.  Once you're ready to go, you'll then get to fight
 Sephiroth.

 Fighting Bizzarro*Sephiroth can be somewhat annoying.  For one thing,
 it has multiple body parts that can be revived after they are killed.
 What's more, it has two cores that are invincible, and the core can
 use an ability called "Bizzarro Enegy" (their spelling, not mine) to
 heal itself by upwards of 6000 HP per use.

 What's more, the boss has a host of attacks, including:

  - [Attack]
  - Bolt3
  - Quake3
  - Ice3
  - Demi3
  - Slow
  - Bizzarro Enegy (heals self)
  - Stigma (causes damage and Poison + Slow to all members).
  - Aurora Fence (produces a missed heal attempt on all members...
    purpose unknown).
                
 When it comes to actually fighting Bizzaro Sephiroth, you can use
 group effect spells (like Aqualung or Trine) to do heavy damage to
 all parts, or singular spells (like Break or Shadow Flare) to do
 heavy damage to a body part.  Don't bother with Fire-based attacks
 (including Magic Breath), as this will only heal parts (D) and (E).

 Your strategy to defeat Sephiroth depends on how many teams you were
 able to form.  If you were able to form more than one team, then you
 have the option of switching teams each time you kill one of Bizzarro
 Sephiroth.  To do so, choose the left option ("Yeah, a little").  If
 you want to continue fighting, choose the right option ("Not really").

 Read on for more information on how to use your teams effectively:

 If you only have one team, simply kill off all the body parts until
 only parts (A) and (C) are left.  You'll get a message that the
 defense of part (C) (the core) has been lessened.  Now kill the core,
 which will prevent Sephiroth from using "Bizzarro Enegy" to heal
 itself.  Then kill off Part (A) and any remaining parts that might
 have revived.

 If you have two teams, kill off a body part and change to the second
 team at the first chanc eyou get.  You'll notice that when using the
 second team, Sephiroth doesn't use "Bizzarro Enegy."  So, kill off
 all the body parts, which will lower the core's defense (part C).
 Then kill the core.  Once all body parts are dead, switch back to
 the first team and kill off the remaining body parts, making sure to
 kill the core before you destroy part (A) (or else it will just use
 Bizzarro Enegy to heal itself).  If you don't switch back to the 1st
 team after killing off all the body parts, you'll be forced to sit
 there and take attacks while waiting for a portion of the body to
 revive.

 I haven't gotten to this boss with three teammates, but I assume the
 method you'd use would be similar to the two team method.  Find the
 team against which Bizzaro Sephiroth does not use "Bizzarro Enegy,"
 then kill off all the body parts, then the core, then switch to
 another team and continue.

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 After defeating this form of Sephiroth, you'll get to fight him again,
 using whichever team delivered the finishing blow to Bizzaro Sephiroth.
 It takes a while for the last battle to load, by the way, so don't get
 surprised if you find yourself staring at a black screen for a while.

                            [Float], Heartless Angel <reduces life of

                Location:   ????
                Notes:      Cannot sense.

 Start off by casting Big Guard or else Barrier and MBarrier on each
 character.  Barrier will defend you from the boss' physical attacks,
 while MBarrier will reduce the damage of Pale Horse, Shadow Flare,
 and Deen.

 If you attempt to use a magic spell on Sephiroth, he will cast Wall
 on himself.  So, if you want, make it something damaging, like
 Shadow Flare.  You can also cast Slow on Sephiroth (or use Bad
 Breath for the same effect).  Sephiroth may cast DeSpell on himself,
 but at least that means it's a round free of damage for your party.
 Alternately, use Magic Hammer on Sephiroth until he runs out of MP;
 this will reduce his arsenal of attacks.

 You're in for trouble if Sephiroth floats up into the air.  For one
 thing, only long-range attacks can hit him (unless you gave your
 character a Long Range materia).  What's more, he's also likely to
 use the Super Nova attack on you (which causes a number of status
 ailments and does heavy damage), or "Heartless Angel," which reduces
 the life of every party member to one point.  It'd help to have a
 few Megalixirs handy in situations like these (or, use Angel Whisper
 on one character, then have them use White Wind on the rest of the
 party).  Sephiroth's "Pale Horse" can also induce several status
 ailments, so making sure characters have Ribbons equipped will help
 matters a lot.

 In terms of strategy, this is technically the last battle, so you might
 as well attack Sephiroth with everything you've got. :)
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 After killing Safer, you have to fight Sephiroth one last time.

                Location:   <unknown>

 Your only option is to use Omnislash.  If you don't use it, and
 Sephiroth attacks you, you will counter with Omnislash.  Interestingly
 enough, if Cloud had a Counter Attack materia equipped, then you will
 make a counterattack, and kill Sephiroth without ever using Omnislash.

 (E)  Emerald Weapon
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Earth Harp, Master Command materia, Master Magic materia,
    Master Summon materia.

 This section deals with killing the the Emerald Weapon, which shows up
 once the Ultima Weapon has been destroyed (see the Disc 2 walkthrough,
 section V for more information).  Despite the fact that the Ruby Weapon
 has powerful attacks and an ungodly amount of HP (some people say a
 million; I would say somewhere above 900,000 points), it can be killed
 with a lot less hassle than you might think.  Here are the Emerald
 Weapon's statistics:

                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Underwater

 There are several methods that can be used to kill the Emerald Weapon:

 ONE MAN METHOD
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Perhaps the simplest set-up for killing the Emerald Weapon is the "one
 man" method.  It takes a while, but is very effective:

  1. Prior to fighting the Emerald Weapon, get into a battle and kill
     off your two teammates.
  2. Then equip your remaining character with Sprint Shoes.
  3. On your weapon or armor, link Knights of Round with HP Absorb.
  4. Also equip a Mime and Underwater materia.
  5. If your character's life is below 9999, give them HP Plus materia
     to raise their life as high as you possibly can (see 6, however).
  6. Make sure you have as few materia equipped as possible.  This is
     because the Emerald Weapon has an attack that will inflict 1111
     damage for each materia equipped.  This means that if you have
     nine or more materia on your persona, you will be instantly killed.
  7. Use a Tranquilizer on yourself to enter the "Sadness" state, and
     put yourself into the back row.
  8. Use a Tent or other item to refill your HP and MP.
  9. Save your game.
 10. Go to your submarine, and submerge.  You can find the Emerald
     Weapon in various spots underwater (it's random).  If it's not
     moving around in the main bay, it can be found near landmarks,
     such as the Gelnika, or the crashed Shinra sub.  Simply touch
     it to get into battle.
 11. In battle, cast Knights of Round.
 12. From then on, choose "Mime" each round until the Emerald Weapon
     dies.
                    
 The Sprint Shoes are necessary to ensure that the Emerald Weapon doesn't
 get in more than two attacks in a row (since you'll die otherwise).
 Putting yourself in the back row and using a Tranquilizer on your
 character will help reduce the amount of damage the Emerald Weapon's
 physical attacks inflict.  Finally since KoR and HP Absorb are linked,
 you will get back tens of thousands of HP (although the display may give
 you a different reading, you'll still get back the proper amount).  This
 makes it very difficult for the Emerald Weapon to kill you.


 DOUBLE KNIGHTS OF ROUND METHOD
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The "Double Knights of Round" method works like the same method you used
 on the Ruby Weapon.  You need to equip W-Summon and cast KoR twice, then
 Mime yourself repeatedly.  This method works faster than the "one man"
 method, but it requires that your KoR materia is at level two or higher
 (two stars).  If it is (and you have a W-Summon materia), you should
 really use this method over the "one man" method.


 TWO OR THREE MAN METHOD
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 You can use either of the above methods with more than one character,
 providing that you have more than one Mime or Master Command materia.
 However, since KoR + HP Absorb will only heal the user and not the
 whole party, the other characters run the risk of getting killed off
 between Mime attempts.  Still, if you can do this, it's preferable to
 the "one man" method.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 Once you kill the Emerald Weapon, you will receive the Earth Harp.
 Return to Kalm Town and enter the house in the northeast area of town.
 Go up to the second floor.  If you talk to the man here, he will take
 your Earth Harp and give you one of each Master materia as a reward.

 (F)  Ruby Weapon
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Items in this section:
  - Desert Rose, a Gold Chocobo.

 This section deals with killing the the Ruby Weapon, which shows up
 once the Ultimate Weapon has been destroyed (see the Disk 2 walkthrough,
 section V for more information).  Despite the fact that the Ruby Weapon
 has powerful attacks and an ungodly amount of HP (some people say a
 million; I would say somewhere above 750,000 points), it can be killed
 with a lot less hassle than you might think.  Here are the Ruby Weapon's
 statistics:

 Ruby's Tentacle B
                LV: <unknown> XP:  <unknown> Steal:  <nothing>

                Ability:    [Attack] <drains MP, causes Death Sentence>
                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Part of Ruby Weapon.
                Notes:      Cannot sense.

 The Ruby Weapon uses "Whirlsand" as a counter when attacked.  This
 removes a character from the battle.  Once only one character is
 left, the Ruby Weapon puts it's hands into the ground, which become
 Ruby's Tentacle A and B, respectively.  While you can poison the
 tentacles and even kill them, this serves no purpose, as Ruby can
 simply put it's hands back into the ground later on to produce two
 more tentacles.

 As for the Ruby Weapon, you can use MBarrier to reduce the damage from
 it's Ruby Ray and Ruby Flame.  That, of course, is assuming you're
 trying to battle this sucker head on, which isn't a good idea.  There
 are several other methods that can be used to kill the Ruby Weapon
 which are much more effective:

 ONE MAN METHOD
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Perhaps the simplest set-up for killing the Ruby Weapon is the "one man"
 method.  It takes a while, but is very effective:

  1. Prior to fighting the Ruby Weapon, get into a battle and kill
     off your two teammates.
  2. Then equip your remaining character with a Mystile and Ribbon.
  3. On the Mystile, link Knights of Round with HP Absorb.
  4. Also equip Mimic, W-Summon, and Hades.  These don't need to be
     linked.
  5. If your character's life is below 9999, give them HP Plus materia
     to raise their life as high as you possibly can.
  6. If your "Magic atk" stat. is low, give your character some Magic
     Plus materia.
  6. Use a Tranquilizer on yourself to enter the "Sadness" state.
  8. Use a Tent or other item to refill your HP and MP.
  9. Save your game.
 10. Go to the Corel Desert, and use the Highwind or a Gold Chocobo
     to touch the Ruby Weapon (it looks like a red head moving through
     the sand.
 11. Once it puts it's hands into the ground, choose "W-Sum." and pick
     Hades and Knights of Round.
 12. From then on, choose "Mime" each round until the Ruby Weapon dies.

 So, how does this method work?  Well, by starting off the battle with
 only one character, Ruby will put it's arms into the ground, which
 makes it vulnerable to physical attack.  By wearing a Mystile, you
 have a higher chance of evading enemy spells, which in this case would
 be the Ruby Weapon's "Ultima" spell.  Wearing a Ribbon prevents the
 tentacles from inflicting a status ailment on you when they hit you.
 By using a Tranquilizer on yourself, you ensure that Ruby's Tentacles
 will hit you for the lowest amount of damage possible.

 Finally, casting Hades and Knights of Round allows you to damage the
 Ruby Weapon _and_ paralyze it (thanks to Hades).  This prevents it
 from attacking you, as it has a nasty habit of interrupting your
 turn in order to get in an attack of it's own.  Because Knights of
 Round is linked to HP Absorb, you will also earn back so much HP per
 casting that it won't even be displayed properly (it will say you
 earned back, say, 1137 HP, when the amount is really up in the tens
 of thousands).  This ensures that your life will stay full throughout
 the battle.  Having a Magic Plus materia equipped will also boost the
 amount of damage that each knight inflicts during Knights of Round.


 DOUBLE KNIGHTS OF ROUND METHOD
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This works like the "one man" method, but you cast Knights of Round
 twice instead of KoR + Hades.  However, this requires that you've gotten
 Knights of Round up to Level 2 or higher (two stars).  This method is
 slightly riskier (since the Ruby Weapon will be attacking you between
 castings), but it can be done, and is much faster than the "one man"
 method.
 

 TWO OR THREE MAN METHOD
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 If you have more than one Mime or Master Command materia, you can always
 use the "one man" method, but have two or all three characters mime the
 person who does the W-Summoning.  Obviously, this also means that you'll
 need Mystiles and Ribbons for your partners.

 Another problem is that while Ultima damages all teammates, KoR + HP
 Absorb only heals the user.  Therefore, you'll want to avoid casting
 KoR twice and stick to KoR + Hades, as your characters will get killed
 off pretty quickly otherwise.  If you want to risk it (and hope your
 Mystiles save you from Ultima), you can always try it, but chances
 are your other characters will end up dead in the process (though it
 will save you some time).

 Also, remember that you still need to go into battle with just one
 character.  Once the Ruby Weapon puts it's hands in the ground, you can
 revive your teammates and get busy spellcasting.  You'll still have to
 watch out for the Ruby Weapon's "Whirlsand," though, which will
 permanently remove a character from your party.
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 Anyway, once you kill the Ruby Weapon, you will receive the Desert Rose.
 Return to Kalm Town and enter the house in the northeast area of town.
 Go up to the second floor.  If you talk to the man here, he will take
 your Desert Rose and give you a Gold Chocobo as a reward.

 6.  SECRETS AND TRICKS
 ========================================================================

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 SOURCE MORPH LOCATIONS
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A few enemies in the game can be morphed into the "Source" items, which
 can be used to permanently raise your stats.  Such monsters include:
 
   Morph Result     Enemy          Location
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   Power Source   Heavy Tank       Meltdown Reactor
   Guard Source   Bagnadrana       Mt. Corel / Corel Reactor
   Power Source   Screamer         Nibel Reactor
   Power Source   8 eye            Temple of Ancients / Battle Square
   Mind Source    Dragon Rider     Whirlwind Maze
   Guard Source   Spiral           Mideel Area
   Power Source   Unknown          Gelnika (Research Room / Cargo Room)
   Guard Source   Unknown 2        Gelnika (Research Room / Cargo Room)
   Magic Source   Unknown 3        Gelnika (Cargo Room)
   Luck Source    Bad Rap          Gelnika (Hallway)     
   Speed Source   Poodler          Gelnika (Hallway)
   Magic Source   Maximum Kimaira  Mako Cannon / Special Battle
   Guard Source   Armored Golem    Inside Northern Cave

 When it comes to morphing enemies, try using Yuffie or Vincent's
 Ultimate Weapons.  Unlike the other Ultimate Weapons, they power up
 under constant conditions.  This means that when you use them as
 a Morph attack, they literally do the same amount of damage as a
 normal attack would.  It's easier to do high damage with Yuffie's
 Conformer, but you can power-up Vincent's Death Penalty by giving
 him Slash-All or using group magics (Trine, for example), to pick
 off large groups of weak enemies (such as those in Corral Valley,
 or in the Mythril Mine, or in Mideel, etc.)

 You can use the Mega-All materia to "Morph" all enemies at once, which
 makes enemies with low HP easy to defeat.  Against enemies with high
 HP (such as those in the Gelnika), use Slash-All or group spells to
 lower their life, then take them out with Morph.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 LUCKY SEVENS
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Lucky 7s (aka "All Seven Fever") is a condition that occurs when one
 of your characters has a current HP amount equal to 7777.  It doesn't
 matter how this number was obtained (through injury, restorative items,
 equipping materia, etc.), just that you get it.

 When in battle, the person with 7777 life will make 62 consecutive
 attacks when it is their turn to attack.  The attacks they make are
 normal attacks and cannot be augmented by Materia, etc.  What's
 more, assuming they don't miss, each attack will hit for 7777 damage,
 even if an enemy has special defenses.  After making that many
 attacks (if the round is still going), that person's life will drop
 to 1 point.

 Charles Lee has provided tons of information on getting the Lucky 7s
 status:

 "4 Examples (please read them all):

   1. Cloud's HP status at the Status Window, let's say, is: 7177/9038
      How do you get 7777 current HP points?
      That is, how to get 7777/9038?

   Ans: Use one Potion (HP +100) and one Hi-Potion (HP +500) on Cloud.
      7177+100+500=7777
      Now if you go into a battle, Cloud will be in "Lucky Sevens".

   2. Cloud's HP status is: 3577/7397
      (Note that the MAXIMUM HP POINTS is now less than 7777.)
      How can you get the "Lucky Sevens" in this example?

   Ans: Raise your maximum HP by equipping HP Plus materia(s).
      Suppose after equipping one HP Plus materia, Cloud's HP status
      becomes: 3577/9038
      To get 7777/9038, you can now use 2 Potions (2*100) and 8
      Hi-Potions (8*500): 3577+(2*100)+(8*500)=7777

   3. HP status is: 7781/9999
      How to get HP to be 7777/9999 for YOUR NEXT BATTLE?

      Let your enemy hit you for a few times.  When your current HP is
      close to and above 6777 (or 5777, 4777, 3777, 2777, 1777, 777,
      BUT NOT 7777 since you automatically go into "Lucky Sevens" mode
      but you actually WANT TO SAVE IT FOR THE NEXT BATTLE!), cast
      "Toad" on him so that he will hit you for 1 point damage only.
      When your current HP reaches 6777 (or 5777, 4777, 3777, 2777,
      1777, or 777), kill the enemy immediately.  As soon as the battle
      is over, go to the Status Window and use (Hi-)Potions to add your
      current HP to 7777.  Now when you enter your next battle, you
      should be able to sneak attack 62 times (which is what the Lucky
      Sevens does) with each of your attack doing 7777 pts of damage.

   4. HP status is: 7775/9999
      How do you get 7777/9999?

   Ans: Let your enemies (or allies) hit you until your current HP is
      close to but above xx77.  Suppose after taking some damage, your
      current HP is now 6285 (close to and above 6277).  Quickly cast
      "Toad" on your enemy transforming him into a frog and let him hit
      you until your current HP is 6277.  Immediately kill him and use
      3 Hi-Potions to add your HP to 7777.

   Note that when a character is in the Lucky Sevens condition, he or
   she will continuously attack 62 times.  When two characters have
   Lucky Sevens, they will attack 63 times _total_.  So if you have
   more characters in this condition, you'll do less damage overall."


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ITEM DUPLICATION TRICK
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To do this trick, you need the W-Item materia (refer to Part One of
 the FAQ for details).  It's found at the far south end of the
 tunnels running beneath Midgar, when you return to the city in Disc 2.

 The only drawback to this trick is that the item you wish to duplicate
 must be usable in battle.  To duplicate an item, equip the W-Item
 materia and go into battle.  Select the item you want to copy, then
 select a target (if necessary).  Then pick another item (it doesn't
 matter which one you pick), but cancel it, instead of using it and
 completing the W-Item entry.  If you keep choosing another 2nd item,
 then canceling it, you will raise the stock of the first item over
 and over.

 For example, let's say you want lots of Sylkis Greens.  In battle,
 the character who has W-Item should pick Sylkis Greens, and a target
 to use it on.  Then, pick a Potion for your second item, but don't
 pick a target.  Instead, cancel your selection, so that you're
 back at the inventory menu (but you still have the Sylkis Greens
 selected).  Your Sylkis Greens stock should have gone up by one.
 Continue to pick and cancel the Potion to earn more Sylkis Greens.

 This is also useful because the Sylkis Greens has the highest resale
 rate of any item in the game, so you can get a bunch of them and sell
 them off for easy money.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 MASTER COMMAND TRICK
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Normally, you can't pair a Support Materia with Slash-All or Double Cut.
 However, if you equip the desired Support materia to Master Command,
 then it will affect Slash-All or Double Cut.

 See the section on "Using Materia" for more information.

 7.  GAME SHARK CODES
 ========================================================================

 There are plenty of Game Shark codes out there for you to use.  What's
 listed here is just a small sample of the many hundreds of codes other
 people have made.  Therefore, if you don't like a code in this section,
 or know of a better one, or have one you'd like to submit, please don't
 bother.  Seriously.  If I were to make this FAQ into a repository of
 FF7 GS codes, it'd be gigantic.  These are just some codes that I find
 particularly fun or useful.  Use at your own risk.  All codes were made
 and tested on a v1.98 GameShark, so they may not work as well with other
 revisions.

                                                        800CD1B0 8000
 Infinite Laser Power                                   800CD1B8 8000
 by Chris MacDonald                                     800D1C5C 0080
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This code gives you infinite laser power during the Speed Square mini-
 game.  You need to turn the code on once the mini-game has begun and
 turn the code off before it ends.  Otherwise, the game will hang.

 - When determining the item's location, remember that it will overwrite
   whatever item was in that location originally.  Stick to using even
   numbers (i.e. C2, 9A, or 88), or the game may hang.  Try to keep the
   range between "8x" and "Cx".
 - When determining the no. of items, keep in mind that you'll have an
   infinite amount unless you turn off the switch.  The number you enter
   is converted to hexidecimal form, so what you put in won't correlate
   with what you actually get.  0 is a valid number and can be used.
 - When determining the item type, you can go from 000 to 13F.

 When this code is on, your character's turn is always ready.  Replace
 "x" with 0 for the first character, 1 for the 2nd character, and 2 for
 the last character.


 Gain Lots of EXP                                       8009D7D8 FFFF
 by Chris MacDonald
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This code changes how much EXP you win after a fight.  Alternately, you
 can replace "FFFF" with any number (0000 would give you no EXP).


 Battle Command Select                                  8009D8A4 02xx
 by Chris MacDonald
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This code changes which command is available in the third slot of your
 character's Battle Command window.  It only affects the character in
 the first position.  You can replace xx with 00 through 1B.

 by Ignacio DeLucas                                     8009CBDE 00zz
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 "xx" is for the character in the first position, "yy" is for the second
 position, and "zz" is for the third position.  You can replace these
 integers with 00 through 0D.

 xx, yy, zz equals:

 02  Tifa      06  Cait Sith    0A  Sephiroth
 03  Aeris     07  Vincent      0B  Chocobo

 "Young Cloud" is the Cloud used during the Nibelheim flashback.
 Sephiroth is controlled by the computer, while "Chocobo" and the
 two "Now Printing" faces are unplayable characters (the Chocobo
 face is used when breeding chocobos, and the "now printing" images
 were used before the character artwork was complete).


 Use Any Option Anywhere                                8009D2A4 xxxx
 by Ignacio DeLucas                                     8009D2A6 0000
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 With this code, all of the Main Menu options are available during any
 point of the game, even if they are greyed out or not supposed to be
 visible without the code.  You can replace "xxxx" with 0000 to have
 no options available, or FFFF to have all options available.  The most
 obvious plus is being able to save or use PHS at anytime.  Note that
 if you have less than 3 members in your party and no "inactive" party
 members when you use PHS, you'll be stuck at the PHS screen.

 Mr. DeLucas would like to stress that credit is also due to the original
 creator of the 'Save Anywhere' code, whoever he/she is, because he used
 that person's code as a basis for this one.


 Set TV Rating during Junon Parade                      80075E40 xxxx
 by Ignacio DeLucas
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 With this code on, during the part in Junon Town (in Disc 1) where you
 are supposed to march behind the soldiers, you can set the percentile
 rating you recieve.  Replace "xxxx" with 0000 for the worst rating, or
 5500 for the best rating.  Note that you should turn this code on after
 the commander tells you to get in line, or the game may glitch.


 Set Drill Exercise Score during Junon Send-Off         80075E3A xxxx
 by Ignacio DeLucas
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 You can set the score Rufus gives you during the final scene of the
 Junon parade, in which the soldiers have to do their drill before Rufus
 leaves.  Replace "xxxx" with 0000 for the worst score, or 0014 for the
 best one.


 Set Points Earned from Playing G-Bike Game             800BDFB4 xxxx
 by Ignacio DeLucas
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 When turned on, this code can be used to determine the score you'll
 receive from the G-Bike game at the Gold Saucer (not the actual G-bike
 scenario when you escape from the Shinra Headquarters).  Replace "xxxx"
 with 0000 for the worst score, or 2000 for the best score.

                                                        800F5CF0 4000
                                                        800F5D34 4000
                                                        800F5D78 4000
 First 5 Enemies Have Been Sensed                       800F5DBC 4000
 by Ignacio DeLucas                                     800F5E00 4000
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 When you use the "Sense" command on an enemy, it shows you it's vital
 stats.  Afterwards, pressing Select and highlighting a "Sensed" enemy
 with the cursor (usually when choosing a target), will display that
 enemy's amount of current/maximum HP.  With this code activated, you
 can see the current/maximum HP of any enemy in the game, as if you had
 "Sensed" them already.

 Note that this code will work on every enemy and boss, but enemies
 that aren't normally able to be 'scanned' may have misleading amounts
 of HP, or they may cause this game to freeze, in which case, you'll
 have to reset.


 Turn Any Tame Chocobo Into A Gold Chocobo              800E5674 0004
 by Igancio DeLucas
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 You have to catch a Chocobo (which is only possible in Disc 2 or 3), and
 then ride them out of the Chocobo Farm.  Once you've done that, turning
 on the code will give your Chocobo all the abilities of a Gold Chocobo.
 Keep in mind that you can't leave the World Map unless you turn off the
 code, although doing this will revert your Chocobo back to it's normal
 self.  Also, the code sometimes hangs if you enter the Corel Desert
 (the desert around the Gold Saucer).


 Cloud Attacks With All Elemental Types                 8009D888 FFFF
 by Ignacio DeLucas
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 When you choose, "Attack", Cloud's attack inflicts all types of
 elemental damage.  However, if an enemy is immune to a certain type
 of element, they will be healed instead of injured.


 Cloud Takes Half Damage From All Elements              8009D88A FFFF
 Cloud Takes No Damage From All Elements                8009D88C FFFF
 Cloud Absorbs Damage From All Elements                 8009D88E FFFF
 by Ignacio De Lucas
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 These codes also protect you from the "non-elemental" damage type as
 well as the normal, listed Elemental attacks.


 Cloud Attacks With All Status Ailments                 8009D890 FFFF
 by Ignacio DeLucas                                     8009D892 FFFF
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 When you choose, "Attack", Cloud's attack inflicts all types of
 status ailments.  "Petrify" takes precdence over all other types of
 damage, however.  Combined with "Slash-All" you can win a battle in
 one sword swing using this code.


 Cloud Is Immune To All Status Ailments                 8009D894 FFFF
 by Ignacio DeLucas                                     8009D896 FFFF
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This protects you from all status ailments, but it also includes
 beneficial status changes, such as Haste.


 Gain Lots Of AP                                        8009D7DC 8FFF
 by Jeff Wong
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 When you win a battle, you'll gain lots of AP.  Don't change the number
 to a value higher than 8FFF or you won't actually earn the AP listed.


 Unlimited Gil                                          8009D260 FFFF
 by Jeff Wong
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This code gives you a huge amount of Gil, which you'll always have the
 same amount of as long as the switch is up.  You can save your game in
 order to keep all the extra money, too.


 Have 9999 GP At The Gold Saucer                        8009D3D2 270F
 by Jeff Wong
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The title says it all.  If you save the game, you'll retain all the GP,
 to boot.


 Have 65000 BP At The Gold Saucer                       8009D3D8 FDE8
 by Jeff Wong, edited by Dave Upton
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This works much like the last two codes in that you'll have lots of BP,
 and that number won't decrease as long as the switch is up.  However,
 since BP are temporary, if you leave the Battle Square with the switch
 off, all your BP are lost.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 As long as the switch is up, you'll never run into battles.  However,
 you will have to fight boss battles and other "mandatory" battles.
 
                                                        8009D2C8 FFFF
                                                        8009D2CA FFFF

 by Charles MacDonald                                   8009D2CE 0007
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 For those interested, the item(s) you get correspond to the individual
 bits enabled within the longword.  In regard to the last set of items,
 there are only three, so don't enable bits for the non-existant items.
 Also, certain key items (Like PHS) you can't use immediately, even
 though you have that item.  That's because the use of some items are
 story-driven.  You just have to wait until they become normally
 usable.

 8.  USING MATERIA
 ========================================================================

 The materia system is pretty intuitive.  However, it's easy to overlook
 some of the advanced features of the materia system, and it may not be
 too clear to first time players how to use materia effectively.  This
 section briefly addresses these topics.
           
 What are materia and their types?
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 They are colored orbs you can pick up as the game progresses.  Some
 characters start out with materia already equipped on them (such as
 Yuffie's Throw materia).  Others can be found, won from battles, or
 purchased from a store.  Materia are useless unless you equip them.
 Once you do so, you can take advantage of the special abilities
 Materia confer onto your character or party.

 There are several types of materia, depending on their color.  They
 include: Magic materia (green), Summon materia (reddish orange),
 Command materia (yellow), Independent materia (pink), and Support
 materia (light blue).


 How do I use materia?
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Different materia types are used in different ways.  One feature of
 all materia is that they must be equipped in order to be used.  You
 can equip materia on your weapon or your armor.  As an example, let's
 look at Cloud's Buster Sword.  It has two linked slots, that look
 like this: 0=0.

 You can put a materia into each slot.  Another example would be the
 Titan Bangle, which has two seperate slots, that look like this: 0 0.
 In this case, you can still attach two materia to the your armor,
 but they are not linked.

 Once a materia is equipped, it can be used.  If it is a Magic, Summon,
 or Command materia, you can use it in battle by selecting the
 appropriate option (Magic, Summon, or the listed command).  Some magic
 materia may also be used outside of battle by choosing "Magic" from
 the Main Menu.

 Independent and Support materia are a different story.  Independent
 materia work automatically, without you having to do anything extra.
 For example, if you equip an HP Plus materia, your character's MaxHP
 statistic will immediately raise.  It remains raised until you remove
 that materia.

 Support materia only work if placed in a linked slot along with
 another Magic, Command, or Summon materia.  We call a set of linked
 materia "pairs", and when you link a Support materia with another
 materia, you are "pairing" it.


 How does pairing work?
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 To pair a set of materia, you must have two linked slots.  Remember
 the diagram for Cloud's Buster Sword?  If you look at the two materia
 slots, there is a horizontal bar connecting them.  It looked a little
 like this: 0=0.  That means the materia slots are linked, and you can
 pair materia together in them.  It doesn't matter which materia goes
 into which slot.  For example, if you pair, Fire + All or All + Fire,
 it will still have the same effect.  In this case, the effect is to
 make the Fire spell hit all targets.

 So what happens if you pair two materia that aren't linked?  Think of
 the Titan Bangle's materia slots again.  They looked a little like
 this: 0 0.  Since the slots are not connected by a = mark, then
 putting Fire in one of them and All in the other will have no effect.
 By that same standard, let's look at another of Cloud's weapons, the
 Butterfly Edge.  It's materia slots are like this: 0=0 0=0.  In this
 case, you can link two pairs of materia.  You'll notice that there
 is still a seperation between each set of slots.  Does this mean
 that it is impossible to link more than two materia together at
 the same time?  Theoretically, yes.  In actuality, however, you can
 get around this by multi-linking materia.


 How do you multi-link materia?
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 To "multi-link" your materia, you must have have at least two materia of
 the same variety.  We'll call these the "base" materia.  For example,
 let's say you own two Gravity materia.  It matters what level they are
 at, so let's say one as at Level 1 (you can use Demi), and one is at
 Level 2 (you can use Demi and Demi2).

 Now, recall the materia slots in Cloud's Butterfly Edge.  They looked
 like this: 0=0 0=0.  Let's say you put the Level 1 Gravity materia
 and HP Absorb into the linked slots on the left, and the Level 2 Gravity
 and All into the linked slots on the right.  It would look something
 like this:

        Gravity (Lv1) + HP Absorb         Gravity (Lv2) + All

 You have now multi-linked a set of Gravity materia.  In battle, if
 you use the ability of the Gravity materia to cast "Demi", then the
 Demi spell will affect all targets (due to All), and it will give
 you back a small amount of HP (due to HP Absorb).  In effect, you
 have linked all of these materia together, even though it appears
 to be two seperate pairs of materia.

 However, note that if you cast Demi2, you will not get the HP Absorb
 effect.  Why is this?  Well, multi-linked materia must share common
 features.  In this case, both Gravity materia have the "Demi" spell
 learned.  However, only the one linked to All has "Demi2" learned.
 The other Gravity materia is still at Level 1.  Therefore, while
 using "Demi" will trigger both pairs of materia, using "Demi2" will
 only trigger the pair on the right.

 Keep in mind that you can multi-link as many of the same materia as
 you want.  Look at this example:

        Gravity + HP Absorb          Gravity + MP Absorb
        Gravity + Steal as well      Gravity + Added cut
        Gravity + Quadra Magic       Gravity + Quadra Magic
        Gravity + MP Turbo           

 First off, you can use Demi as a Quadra Magic spell more than five
 times in battle, because you have two Quadra magics equipped.  Demi
 will do more damage thanks to MP Turbo, and every time it hits an
 enemy, you get back 1/10 of the damage as HP and 1/100 as MP.  Each
 time the spell hits, you will make a steal attempt, and after all
 four attempts, you'll make a physical attack (thanks to Added cut).


 What materia cannot be linked?
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 You cannot link Support materia with Independent materia or a second
 Support materia.  Go ahead and try it...nothing will happen.  Support
 materia can only be linked to Command, Summon, or Magic materia.

 Within this rule there are a number of exceptions.  For example, the
 "All" materia, although it is a Support materia, only affects Magic
 materia.  Linking it with Command or Summon materia has no effect.
 A further exception to the rule would be the fact that it only
 works with specific Magic materia...if you pair All with Full Cure,
 you'll find that it has no effect.

 Another exception would be when it comes to "Knights of Round."   This
 spell cannot be linked to Quadra Magic, whether you pair it with the
 Knights of Round materia or the Master summon materia.


 What about linking "Master Command / Magic / Summon" materia?
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Master materia can be linked in the same way as normal Magic and Summon
 materia are linked.  This means that if you pair Master Magic with All,
 you can use All with any of the spells made available through Master
 Magic (though there are obvious exceptions, such as Resist + All, which
 doesn't work normally anyway, as explained above).

 Another example would be Master Summon + Quadra Magic, which would
 affect all summons except for "Knights of Round" (see above for more
 information).  Finally, Master Command + Added Cut would make you
 perform an attack after using any command enabled by Master Command
 (such as Item, Sense, or Throw).


 How about multi-linking "Master Command / Magic / Summon" materia?
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Let's review how linking works.  One of the rules of a multi-link is
 that you must have the same type of "base" materia.  Let's say you
 wanted to multi-link HP Absorb and MP Absorb to Master Summon.  Wouldn't
 this mean that you need two Master Summon materia?  Theoretically, yes,
 and you can do it this way.  However, in the case of the "Master"
 materia, all you need to keep in mind is "common features."  In this
 case, let's say you do the following:

        Master Summon + HP Absorb      Alexander + MP Absorb

 Because you can cast Alexander with the Master Summon or Alexander
 materia, doing so will result in your earning back HP and MP (thanks
 to the two "Absorb" materia).  It doesn't matter that they are
 different materia, because they share a "common feature."  Note
 that if you used the Master Summon materia to cast Phoenix, there
 would be no MP absorbed, because you cannot cast Phoenix using an
 Alexander materia. ;)

 The same would apply to multi-linking, let's say, Ice and Master
 Magic.  Only the "Ice" spells that the two pairs had in common
 would work.  As for Master Command, multi-linking affects all
 the commands that Master Command gives you.
                                            

 Isn't there a glitch that involves the Master Command materia?
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes.  One exception to the rule of linking Command materia is that
 you cannot pair them Double Cut or Slash All.  However, if you pair
 a Master Command materia with a Support materia, then equip Double
 Cut or Slash All, you can use "2x-cut", "4x-cut", "Slash-All", or
 "Flash" in battle, and the Support materia will be triggered.
 For example, look at this setup:

        Master Command + Steal as well          Slash-All

 Although Double Cut is not linked to Steal as well, if you use
 "Slash-All" or "Flash" in battle, your character will steal from
 each target after attacking.


 Can you multi-link materia using the glitch?
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes, but this requires that you have more than one Master Command
 materia.  For example, look at the following setup:

        Master Command + Steal as well          Double Cut
        Master Command + HP Absorb              

 Double Cut is not paired to anything else, yet when "2x-cut" or "4x-cut"
 is used in battle, your character will absorb some HP with each hit and
 make multiple steal attempts, thanks to HP Absorb and Steal as well.

 Enemy Skill            Sells for 1 gil

 Enemy Skills are spells that you can only learn if an enemy uses the
 spell on you while you have an "Enemy Skills" materia equipped.  In
 some cases you can (or must) Manipulate the enemy in order to get them
 to use their Enemy Skill.  You'll know if you learned the skill because
 your character will spin around and a message will appear.  However,
 in order to keep the spell (even if your character is killed), your
 party must go on to win the battle.  If you run away or escape, you
 won't keep the Enemy Skill.

 Note that if yo have two Enemy Skill materia equipped and are trying to
 learn a skill that one materia already has on it (say, one has Magic
 Hammer, one doesn't, and you're trying to learn Magic Hammer from an
 enemy), then the "empty" Enemy Skill materia cannot learn that ability.
 However, if you had more than one Enemy Skill materia equipped and
 _both_ of them were missing Magic Hammer, then getting hit by that
 skill would teach it to both Enemy Skill materia.

 Found      Shinra HQ, Junon, Forgotten City, Chocobo Sage's house
 Notes      Below is a list of the Enemy Skills and some information
            about them, as well as monsters you can learn the skills
            from.  Please see the Disc 1-3 walkthroughs for more
            information on which enemies give you Enemy Skills.  Skills
            are listed in order:

          healed for 8000 points, your life is actually lowered to
          8000.  Unfortunately, this ability doesn't work on enemies

 defend or attack with it.  For example, if you pair Seal with Added
 Effect on your armor, you are defended from Sleep and Silence, even if
 you haven't learned the "Silence" spell yet.

 10.  LIMIT BREAK INFO.
 ========================================================================

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 LEARNING LIMIT BREAKS
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 [ THE BASICS ]  --------------------------------------------------------

 Earning new Limit Breaks is not that difficult.  There's a formula that
 applies to figuring out when you get your next Break.  It works like
 this:

 To get the first break of each new level, you must kill a certain
 number of enemies.  For example, for Cloud to learn the Blade Beam or
 Meteorain, he has to defeat many enemies.  How you defeat them is not
 important (even using spells or Enemy Skills will count towards the
 total), as long as your direct action results in the enemy's death.

 To get the second break of each level, you have to use the first
 break a certain number of times.  Using Cloud as an example once again,
 to learn the Cross-slash, Climhazzard, or Finishing Touch, you'd
 have to use the first Limit Break of that level repeatedly until you
 learned the new Break.

 Note that you earn your new Break after the current battle is won.
 So, if you are ready to learn a new Break but run away from a battle,
 you won't learn it.  This doesn't apply to the Level 4 Limit Breaks,
 though.

 To learn your Level 4 Limit Break, you need to have learned all the
 other previous Breaks.  Then, read your character's Limit Break Manual
 (such as Cloud's Omnislash).

 The two exceptions to this rule are Vincent and Cait Sith.  They only
 have one Limit Break per level.  To earn new Limit Breaks, they simply
 need to kill enough enemies.  For Cait, he only has one other Break
 to learn, so just kill enough enemies until he learns it.  For Vincent,
 you have to learn all three of his Breaks, then read the Chaos manual
 to obtain the fourth and final Limit Break.

 Note that there is a glitch involving the learning of Limit Breaks.
 You may learn all of them, or none of them, despite how many enemies
 you kill or how many times you use your other breaks.  You may also
 be unable to read your Limit Break Manual even if you've learned all
 your other breaks.  There's no way around this, as far as I know.

 For more detailed information on learning Limit Breaks, try reading
 GideonD's "Limit Break Mechanics Guide", available at GameFAQs
 <http://www.gamefaqs.com>.

 [ TIPS FOR LEARNING THE BREAKS ]  --------------------------------------

 When it comes to learning first level breaks (the ones that require
 killing a lot of enemies), I recommend finding an area where you can
 fight large groups of low-level enemies.  Examples include the
 clusters of Malldancers and Boundfats found in the Corral Valley,
 the Headhunters found in the forests near Mideel, or the Castanets
 and Crawlers found in the Mythril Mine.  You can wipe them out using
 physical methods (such as "Slash-All" or "Mega-All"), or you can use
 spells (such as Lightning + All or the "Trine" Enemy Skill).  In this
 way, a single character can take out groups of 3-5 enemies at a time.

 To learn your second level breaks (the ones that require using your
 first break multiple times), try giving that character a Hyper, so
 that they are in the Hyper status and earn more Limit Gauge energy
 when damaged.  What's more, give them the worst possible armor, as
 well as a Cover materia, so that they always take the enemy's hits
 for the most possible damage.  Furthermore, make sure they're in the
 front row, as allies in the back row take only half damage.  For
 the Limit Breaks that do damage, give your character a weak weapon,
 so that the Breaks do less damage.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 LIMIT BREAK MANUAL LOCATIONS
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Here are the locations of each character's Limit Break Manual:

 OMNISLASH (for Cloud)
 You can earn it from the Battle Square at the Gold Saucer, but this
 requires earning a huge amount of Battle Points in one visit (since
 you lose points once you leave the Battle Square).  What's more, this
 means that you need enough GP to pay for multiple battles.  Make sure
 Cloud has some good equipment and materia equipped in order to get
 through this.  For example, giving him an Enemy Skill materia with
 "White Wind" and "Big Guard" learned is a plus, as well as putting
 him in the back row and giving him a Long Range materia.  Slash-All
 can be used to kill multiple enemies, or you can use Enemy Skills
 like "Trine" and "Aqualung."  You can use HP Plus materia to raise
 his life, and equip him with a Ribbon so that you needn't worry about
 status ailments.
            
 CATASTROPHE (for Barret)
 After surviving the runaway train ride from the reactor into North
 Corel in Disc 2, you can get this manual by talking to a lady wearing
 a hat in one of the buildings in North Corel.
            
 FINAL HEAVEN (for Tifa)
 After getting Cloud back into your party (halfway through Disc 2 or
 at anytime in Disc 3), go to Nibelheim with Tifa in your party and
 play the "Highwind" theme on the piano in Tifa's room.  The theme is
 as follows:

                X, S, T, L1+T, L1+S, X, S, T, L1+X, O, X, S, X
            
 GREAT GOSPEL (for Aeris)
 Once you get the Tiny Bronco, go visit the blacksmith who lives on the
 peninsula near the Gold Saucer.  You can give him a piece of Mythril,
 then open the small door on the east wall on the second floor of his
 house to find the Great Gospel.

 If you don't have any Mythril, you need to drive your Buggy into Costa
 del Sol, which will take you back to the first continent.  You can now
 use the buggy to cross the river to find a cave where a sleeping man
 lives.  Most of the time, he'll tell you how many battles you were in.
 If the last two digits of your battle count are odd (such as 99 or
 255), he'll give you a piece of Mythril.
            
 COSMO MEMORY (for Red XIII)
 Go to Nibelheim and unlock the safe on the 2nd floor of the Shinra
 Mansion.  The code to unlock the safe is:

                right to 36, left to 10, right to 59, right to 97

 Remember, you can't go past the number you're supposed to pick, or the
 lock won't open.  After it opens, a boss will come out.  Beat the boss,
 and you can find the Cosmo Memory manual.

 HIGHWIND (for Cid)
 His manual is found in the Gelnika (the plane that crashes underwater
 and is only reachable by submarine) during Disc 2 or 3.

 IRRECONCILABLE (for Yuffie)
 Get Yuffie to join your party and go to Wutai.  If you're on Disc 1 or
 2, you'll need to complete her sub-quest first (Section V, Disc One for
 details).  Then, go to the Pagoda north of town and defeat all the
 bosses, including Godo.  Once you kill him, you'll get her manual.
            
 CHAOS (for Vincent)
 Once you have a submarine or a Green, Black, or Gold Chocobo, go to the
 waterfall in the middle of the western continent.  Enter the waterfall
 from the side with the dock next to it, and make sure Vincent is in
 your party.  You'll meet a woman named Lucrecia.  Then visit the
 waterfall again at a later time (you can even visit in Disc 3 if you
 saw her first in Disc 2), and you'll find his Limit Break Manual
 waiting for you.

 [ CLOUD STRIFE ]  ------------------------------------------------------

 Braver                                                       Level 1 / 1

    Hits one opponent.

 Cross-slash                                                  Level 1 / 2
  - Cloud uses his sword to slash out the "kyou" kanji (Japanese for
    "bad luck.")  Hits one opponent and may cause "Paralysis."

  - A light appears at the tip of Cloud's weapon, and he throws a
    funnel of rising air at his foes.  It sucks them in and sends
    them flying into the air for an instant kill attack.  Those
    who survive hit the floor and are damaged.  Hits all enemies.

  - A column of wind surrounds Cloud, and his sword glows.  He then
    makes fifteen consecutive attacks and can hit multiple enemies

 [ BARRET WALLACE ]  ----------------------------------------------------

 Big Shot                                                     Level 1 / 1

  - Like the Big Shot, but Barret fires a blue fireball instead.  It
    does no damage, but drains one opponent of up to 999 MP.

    but if it is successful, it instantly kills that enemy.

  - Barret leaps into the air and fires a huge beam of light down at
    his opponents.  Hits multiple times.

 [ TIFA LOCKHEART ]  ----------------------------------------------------

 Tifa's Limit Break works differently than other character's breaks.
 When she uses her Limit Break, she performs as many attacks as she
 can up to that current level.  In other words, if you choose to do
 the Waterkick, Tifa will preceed it with the Beat Rush and Somersault.

 However, what attacks she performs depends on the "slots" game that
 you play every time you try to perform her Limit Break.  If you pick
 "Hit," she will do that move.  If you pick "Yeah!" she will do that
 move, but it inflicts added damage.  If you pick "Miss," she will
 not do that move and go onto the next one, if any.  New slots are
 added as you learn moves, (up to seven slots when you are trying to
 perform the Final Heaven).

 Tifa's Limit Breaks only hit one opponent, but she will randomly
 attack an opponent each time she performs a new Limit Break.

 Beat Rush                                                    Level 1 / 1
  - Tifa does a quick series of attacks.  Hits one opponent.

 Somersault                                                   Level 1 / 2
  - Tifa does a somersault kick.  Hits one opponent.

 Waterkick                                                    Level 2 / 1
  - Tifa does a sweep kick.  Hits one opponent.

 Meteodrive                                                   Level 2 / 2
  - Tifa does a back drop on one opponent.

 Dolphin Blow                                                 Level 3 / 1
  - Tifa does a rising uppercut, accompanied by a dolphin that flies
    along with her.  Hits one opponent.

 Meteor Strike                                                Level 3 / 2
  - Tifa grabs one opponent, jumps into the air, and bodyslams them
    in a huge explosion.

 Final Heaven                                                 Level 4 / 1
  - Tifa gathers power into her fist and strikes one opponent with an
    exploding punch.

 [ AERIS GAINSBOROUGH ]  ------------------------------------------------

  - Wind encircles Aeris and restores lost HP to the whole party.

 Seal Evil                                                    Level 1 / 2
  - Purple lights fly into each of Aeris' opponents.  This inflicts
    both "Stop" and "Silence" on them.

 Breath of the Earth                                          Level 2 / 1
  - Blue lights wrap around your party, removing any status ailments.

 Fury Brand                                                   Level 2 / 2
  - Blue lightning and yellow lights surround all three characters.
    This will max out their Limit Break Gauges (excluding Aeris).

 Planet Protector                                             Level 3 / 1

    for a short period of time.

    three fluttering angels.  Has the same effect as Planet Protector
    and Pulse of Life.

 [ RED XIII ]  ----------------------------------------------------------

 Sled Fang                                                    Level 1 / 1
  - Blue energy swirls around Red XIII, who rams into one opponent.

 Lunatic High                                                 Level 1 / 2
  - Yellow vapor shoots up around each party member.  Causes "Haste"
    to each ally and raises their defensive power.
                                                                     
 Blood Fang                                                   Level 2 / 1
  - Same as the Sled Fang, but red energy surrounds Red as he moves.
    This attack gives back a small amount of HP and MP to Red XIII.
    It only hits one opponent, though.

  - A full moon appears, and Red XIII leaps up and howls at it.  This
    casts both "Berserk" and "Haste" on him at the same time.

 Earth Rave                                                   Level 3 / 2
  - The screen turns red as Red XIII make multiple attacks of various
    sorts that cause fire to burst forth and shower the enemy.

  - A starfield appears and stars gather into a ball of fire that then
    emits a ray of flame at Red XIII's opponents, resulting in a huge
    explosion.  Hits all enemies.

    damage.

 [ CAIT SITH ]  ---------------------------------------------------------

 Dice                                                         Level 1 / 1
  - Cait's stuffed moogle throws some dice onto the ground.  The score
    you roll determines how much damage one enemy takes.

 Slots                                                        Level 2 / 1
  - A slot machine game.  What result you get determines the outcome of
    this move:
                                              
       Random Summon                                    (Bar / Bar / Bar)
        - Cait casts a randomly determined Summon spell.

       Toy Soldier                                (Crown / Crown / Crown)
        - Toy soldiers appear and fire at all of Cait's enemies.

        - Cait's allies disappear and his moogle grows larger, gaining
          9999 HP and 999 MP.  In this form, he can do anything Cait
          can do, except using Limit Breaks.  His attacks also do more
          damage.  When the battle is over, the amount of HP and MP
          left are split among all three characters (and in the
          process, anyone who was dead before Transform was used is
          revived).  This means that using this move may drop your
          current HP level if your HP amount is over 3000 points.

       Game Over                                     (Face / Face / Face)

        - All allies are instantly killed.  There is no way to avoid
          dying, even if you use something like a Safety Bit or Death
          Force.

       Toy Box                                    (any other combination)
        - A random object is dropped on one enemy.  It can include a Hell
          House enemy, Fat Chocobo, Magic Hammer, icicles, a boulder, a
          weight similar to the one used in the ???? spell, or even
          falling meteors.  It's possible to get a critical hit during
          any of these attacks, too.  Note that only the weight can hit
          multiple opponents.

 [ VINCENT VALENTINE ]  -------------------------------------------------

 When Vincent's Limit Breaks are used, he transforms and becomes
 uncontrollable for the rest of the battle, performing one of two
 trademark attacks each round.  However, his HP will double when used
 and fill up to that amount.  Note that it is still possible to affect
 a transformed Vincent with status ailments, such as Mini or Sleep.

    which is a Lightning-based attack that hits all enemies.

 Hellmasker                                                   Level 3 / 1
  - Vincent becomes a chainsaw-wielding killer in a hockey mask.  He
    has two attacks; Splatter Combo, which is a chainsaw attack against
    one opponent, and Nightmare, which is a poison gas attack that
    afflicts one enemy with Silence, Sleep, and Toad, in addition to
    doing Poison-based damage.

 Chaos                                                        Level 4 / 1
  - Vincent becomes a bat-winged demon.  His two attacks are Chaos
    Saber, which is a wing slash against one opponent, and Satan Slam,

 Hyper Jump                                                   Level 2 / 1

    ground.  Pulling it out creates a wave of blue light that damages
    all enemies.  May cause instant death.

 Dragon                                                       Level 2 / 2

 * Aeris' Ultimate Weapon is different in that it only has seven slots,
   and it has a normal growth rate.

 [ ULTIMA WEAPON ]  -----------------------------------------------------

 - The Ultima Weapon is for Cloud.  It's won from the Ultima Weapon after
   killing it in Cosmo Canyon during Disc 2 or 3.
 - The attack power of the Ultima Weapon depends on the difference
   between Cloud's current and maximum HP scores.  The bigger the
   difference, the weaker the weapon gets.  You can actually see this
   in effect, as the blade becomes more transparent as Cloud loses
   HP.

 [ PREMIUM HEART ]  -----------------------------------------------------

 - The Ultima Weapon is for Tifa.  It's found in the "ITEM" building in
   Wall Market after getting the "Key to Sector 5" in Disc 2 or 3.
 - The attack power of the Premium Heart goes up at Tifa's Limit Break
   Gauge increases.  She inflicts the most damage when it is almost
   full (short of Limit Break becoming available).
 - However, it's also been shown that the attack power goes up when
   Tifa gets a MISS on one of her slots while attempting to perform her
   Limit Break.

 [ MISSING SCORE ]  -----------------------------------------------------

 - The Missing Score is for Barret.  It's found on a landing while
   climbing the scaffolding that leads to the top of the Mako Cannon
   at the end of Disc 2 (when the Cannon is at Midgar City).  Barret
   _must_ be in your party in order to see the chest which contains
   this item.
 - The Missing Score's attack power is determined by the number of
   materia inserted into it, and their total amount of AP earned.
   Therefore, equipping mastered materia will result in a higher
   attack power than equipping non-mastered materia.

 [ LIMITED MOON ]  ------------------------------------------------------

 - The Limited Moon is for Red XIII.  It's given to you by Bugenhagen in
   Disc 3, if you leave the Northern Crater and return to Cosmo Canyon
   with Red XIII in your party.
 - The attack power of the Limited Moon depends on the difference
   between Red XIII's current and maximum MP scores.  The bigger the
   difference, the weaker the weapon gets.

 [ PRINCESS GUARD ]  ----------------------------------------------------

 - This weapon is for Aeris.  It's found in the Temple of Ancients in
   Disc 1.
 - The Princess Guard also increases your defense power by +12.
   The power of this weapon increases when Aeris' partners are
   dead or near death.

 [ VENUS GOSPEL ]  ------------------------------------------------------

 - The Venus Gospel is for Cid.  It's given to you by the man in Rocket
   Town who gave you the Yoshiyuki, if you talk to him repeatedly after
   the rocket ship launches and your party returns to earth in Disc 2.
 - The attack power of the Venus Gospel depends on the difference
   between Cid's current and maximum MP scores.  The bigger the
   difference, the weaker the weapon gets.

 [ CONFORMER ]  ---------------------------------------------------------

 - The Conformer is for Yuffie.  It's found in the Gelnika (the plane
   that crashes underwater and is only reachable by submarine) during
   Disc 2 or 3.
 - The Conformer's attack power changes depending on the experience level
   of the enemy she is fighting.  The higher their level, the more damage
   she inflicts.
   
 [ HP SHOUT ]  ----------------------------------------------------------

 - The HP Shout is for Cait Sith.  It's found when you return to the
   Shinra Building in Disc 2, in one of the lockers on floor 66.
 - The attack power of the HP Shout depends on the difference
   between Cait Sith's current and maximum HP scores.  The bigger the
   difference, the weaker the weapon gets.

 [ DEATH PENALTY ]  -----------------------------------------------------

 - The Death Penalty is for Vincent.  It's found when you visit
   Lucretia's cave with Vincent in your party during Disc 2, then return
   at a later point (even if you return in Disc 3). 
 - The Death Penalty's attack power changes depending on how many
   enemies Vincent has killed since joining your party.

 BATTLE FORMATIONS
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 There are five types of formations that can occur when you go into a
 battle:

 Normal
  - The standard battle formation.

 Pre-Emptive
  - Your party gets to strike first.

 Back Attack
  - Your party is on the other side of the screen, and their rows are
    reversed (so characters in the back row are now in front, and vice
    versa).  The enemy party also gets to go first.

 Side Attack
  - Your party appears on either side of the enemy (this means one
    member of your party on the left and two on the right, or vice
    versa).  Enemy attacks that would normally hit all members will
    only hit the ally that enemy is facing.

 Pincer Attack
  - Your party appears with the enemy on either side of you.  You can't
    run away in this situation unless you kill all the enemies on one
    side.  In this type of formation, spells that would hit "all"
    enemies instead only hit the ones facing your character.

 GOLD SAUCER GAME INFO.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 I personally have never been that good at the games in the Gold Saucer,
 but a number of contributors have written in about them with some very
 useful information, such as Martin Debes, David McGrath, and KFattyPro2.
 This section is a compilation of the info. they've provided.

 SUBMARINE GAME
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The first play nets you 20 GP.  The first time you win the following
 battles, you'll get an item.

   - Underwater Huge Materia Battle:  Ink
   - Level 1:                         T/S Bomb
   - Level 2:                         Dragon Fang
   - Level 3:                         Dragon Scales
   - Level 4:                         Cauldron


 ARM-WRESTLING GAME
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 You can win 1 GP for 100 gil by fighting the Sumo wrestler, or 2 GP
 for 100 gil by fighting the 'normal' wrestler.


 MOG HOUSE GAME
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The first time you win at 'Mog House' the person standing behind you
 will give you 30 GP.


 BASKETBALL GAME
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The first 10 dunks in a row are worth 1 GP, the 11th will double that
 amount to 20 GP.  The next ten dunks are worth 1 GP, and the 22nd dunk
 doubles that to 60 GP.  This continues at every next dunk, presumably
 (33, 44, etc.)


 BIKE-RACING GAME
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 You can earn 10 GP instead of 2 GP if you score over 10,000 points.  In
 addition, you'll get a Speed Plus materia the first time you do this.
                    

 SNOWBOARD RACING
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 If Tifa or Cid is in your party, they'll randomly ask if they can play
 in your place.  Check out Tifa on the snowboard!

 Blue and Green balloons are worth 3 and 5 points, respectively.  Blue
 are semi-hard, while Green take a bit of skill to collect.  Don't forget
 to edge (R1)! It'll help you take corners a lot easier.  If you're going
 fast enough when you reach the goal, jump right before you pass the
 sign.  You'll fly through, hit the retaining barrier at the end, and fly
 right back out again!)

 The ranks in the normal courses are BAD (0-49), AWFUL (50-69), and GOOD
 (70-100?)

 [ COURSE A ]  ----------------------------------------------------------

 Speed up before coming to the course, then jump at the first cliff so
 you can nab the Blue balloon.  If you miss it, press Start and choose
 RETRY -- it won't cost you any more Gil.  (With free continues, one
 wonders how Shinra makes any money on this game!)  Keep collecting
 balloons and avoiding obstacles until you see the Moogle holding the
 arrow.  Ether slow down or take the curve creatively; I recommend the
 former, since a Blue balloon is soon after, surrounded by snow chocobos.
 A while later is the downhill portion -- don't miss the Blue balloon on
 your way in -- and this is your place to gain some speed.  Just avoid
 the obstacles!  Near the end you'll have to swerve around some igloos;
 make sure you do it at a high enough speed to clear the arch up ahead
 so you can collect the Green balloon.  The first time you score at
 least 90 points, you'll get 20 GP and a Safety Bit.

 [ COURSE B ]  ----------------------------------------------------------

 Don't miss the Blue balloon, but try to miss the rock under it.  A
 couple of sharp turns soon after requires skillful turning.  Too little,
 and you'll hit the walls.  Too much, and you'll spin out.  After a few
 more curves, you'll come to a metal-lined area with a Blue balloon near
 the beginning.  Following that is a sharp curve, then a forest with
 another Blue balloon between two trees.  Right at the end is an arch,
 beyond which is a Green balloon over a snow chocobo.  Time the jump
 right to clear the chocobo.  Several sharp turns challenge you soon
 after -- be careful not to hit the warning signs! -- and then you're
 given a breather with a slow curve to the left.  There's one more short
 curve, then the goal.

 [ COURSE C ]  ----------------------------------------------------------

 Soon after you enter the course is a line of 8 red balloons followed
 by a cliff and a blue balloon.  Collect 'em (and RETRY if you don't.)
 Beware the unmarked sharp turns that follow, and watch out for the
 snowman -- that blue thing is his hat, not a balloon....  Next are the
 ice caves.  Dodge falling icicles, and don't go straight through in the
 cavern areas, as chunks of ice will fall from the ceiling.  Dodge around
 the chunks, and collect the balloons.  Soon after the second cavern area
 is the exit; be sure to collect the Blue balloon as you jump out.  The
 rocky area after the caves shouldn't present too much of a challenge,
 but the curves soon after may.  Near the bottom, you'll come across Blue
 and Green balloons, each well protected; don't hit the obstacles in
 front, or the balloons will fly away.  Two balloons after is the exit.

 [ TIME ATTACK ]  -------------------------------------------------------

 Score at least a Good -- 70 points -- on each of the three tracks, and
 a yellow balloon will appear at the beginning of the track.  Collect it
 and all the obstacles'll disappear from the courses.  The objective now
 is to race your way through the courses.  Your best race time since the
 PSX was turned on will be represented by a ghost moogle.  Press START
 during the game and you'll be able to select between a snowboarding or
 a sledding moogle.  (You'll also be able to change the ground texture
 from snow to checkered.) Stay ahead of the moogle, and you'll have
 beaten your old time.  (On the straightaway at the end of Course A,
 either make sure Cloud is centered, or that he has a good lawyer....)
 The ranks in Time Attack are Fail, Poor, and Average.  There are
 surely more.

 As far as snowboarding goes:

 W/ Ballons               get

 -Good (beginner)        30 GP + Safety Bit
 -Good (advanced)        nothing
 -Good (crazy)           nothing

 I finally broke sec. on the beginner course (53.824) which gave me a
 "super" (the best) which meant that I had achieved a super on every
 course.  Now there is a new "ghost" I can race against!!!  It is a
 little cactrot (cactus type enemy from FFIII) I forget what they are
 called on this game however, it races me down the hill running.

 If you get 97/100 on advanced course you will get 100 GP and "All"
 Materia (>95 ?? may work too)

 If you get 96/100 on the crazy course you will get 300GP and a Crystal
 Bangle (>90 ?? may work too)


 CHOCOBO RACING
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Again, Tifa or Cid will randomly ask to take your place in the race if
 they're in your party.

 There are four ranks in the Chocobo Races.  In increasing order, they
 are: C, B, A, and S.  Placing first moves you up in rank.  Place first
 in S a few times, and you'll win a prize pack of sorts for being so
 good: Sprint Shoes, Precious Watch, Cat's Bell, Chocobracelet, and a
 "Counter Attack" Materia.  (This only happens once).  Beware that
 sometimes you'll race against Teioh, whose Chocobo's stats are always
 higher than your own (+15 km, +250 stamina).  You *can* beat him, but
 it gets progressively more difficult as you advance in rank.
 Incidentally, once you race a Chocobo to S rank, you can bet at that
 rank.

 To win the bonus in S-Class 10 races need to be won (by the same
 chocobo).  The win ratio is 7:5:3 i.e. for best prizes only have 3/15
 (1/5) chance.  Green, Black & Gold chocobos also have an advantage in
 the racing, as they are not slowed by Space (Short), or the Waterfall
 (Long Course).

 BATTLE SQUARE
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Finally, a section actually written by me ;)  This is really just a
 copy of the information already found in the Disc 1 walkthough.
 
 For 10 GP, you can pick one character and have them fight eight sets
 of enemies in one consecutive battle.  However, there is a catch.
 After each battle, a roulette-like device starts spinning, and you
 must press Circle to make it stop.  When it stops, you will be
 afflicted with a certain condition.  The conditions last for the
 remainder of the battle and are as follows:

   Sword                Weapon is unequipped.
   Bracelet             Armor is unequipped.
   Ring                 Accessory is unequipped.
   Item Bag             Item command is disabled.
   Green Materia        Magic materia are disabled.
   Yellow Materia       Command materia are disabled.
   Purple Materia       Independent materia are disabled.
   Blue Materia         Support materia are disabled.
   Red Materia          Summon materia are disabled.
   Five Materia         All materia are disabled.
   Leather Boot         Speed is cut in half.
   Stopwatch            Total game time x30 = damage inflicted on you.
   Blue Cure            Restores HP
   HP Sign              Max HP is halved.
   MP Sign              Max MP is halved.
   HP/MP Sign           Max HP/MP is halved.
   MP Zero              Current MP drops to zero.
   Small Lv Down        EXP Level goes down by 5.
   Big Lv Down          EXP Level goes down by 10.
   Poison Bubbles       Afflicted with "Poison" ailment.
   Mini-Cloud           Afflicted with "Mini" ailment.
   Lucky 7              No handicap.
   Frog                 Afflicted with "Frog" ailment.

 Keep in mind that if you are protected from status ailments (such
 as having a Ribbon equipped), nothing will happen if you get the
 Frog, Mini, or Poison conditions.

 If you win all eight battles, you will earn Battle Points (BP).  BP can
 then be exchanged for prizes by examining the vending machines in the
 lower left and right corners of the screen.  You cannot save your BP as
 you can GP; it will reset to zero once you leave the Battle Square room.
 You will earn zero BP if you are killed in battle, or if you run away.
 Keep in mind that any damage you take in the Battle Square is "faked"
 and won't affect you in reality.  The same applies to using your Limit
 Breaks--the meter will return to whatever level it was prior to you
 beginning a fight.

 Note that you cannot earn EXP, AP, or Gil from the monsters you fight
 in the Battle Arena.  What's more, you cannot learn Enemy Skills from
 them.  However, you can Steal from them and Morph them into items.

 To find out what you can spend your BP on, check out the next section
 about prizes available at the Gold Saucer.

 13.  MONSTER LIST
 ========================================================================

 All monsters (including bosses and other "rare" enemies) are listed in
 alphabetical order, going from 0-9 and then A to Z.  If a monster has
 multiple parts (like the Warning Board's Laser Cannon), or if certain
 enemies are always found together (like Bottomswell and Waterpolo or
 the various battles against the Turks), then they are listed after that
 enemy and not alphabetically.

 In some cases, a GameShark code is required to get a certain statistic
 (for example, you can't manipulate a "1st Ray," because you don't get
 the Manipulate materia until much later on in the game).  However, I've
 listed all of the statistics, just for the sake of being complete.

 In rewriting this list, I have also referenced the excellent monster
 list from v1.6, written by WhisQ (that was hands down the best
 contribution I've ever received).  Any information from that list is
 written in curly braces, {like so}.

 I've also referred to the FF7 International "Perfect Guide" for missing
 information neither WhisQ nor I could figure out.  Unfortunately, the
 guide is not as useful as you'd think (since it's based on the original
 Japanese version of FF7).  Any information from this source is written
 in stars *like so*.
                       
 Otherwise, everything has been confirmed by yours truly.  Also, I don't
 list an enemy's basic attack in the Abilities section (such as the
 Grashtrike's Sickle) unless it has some special effect or the enemy
 cannot be manipulated.

 If something is written in brackets, like this: [], then it is an
 assumed name for an attack and not the known, official name.

 If something is written in like so: <> then it is a note from me and
 not an actual attack, item, or spell, etc.

 Finally, note that some monsters encountered in the Battle Square have
 double the normal amount of HP (such as the Blue Dragon having 17600
 HP instead of the normal amount of 8800 HP).

 On with the monster list:

 1st Ray
                LV: 4         XP:  12        Steal:  <nothing>
                HP: 18        AP:  1         Morph:  Potion
                MP: 0         Gil: 5         Leaves: *nothing*
                Weakness:   Lightning
                Ability:    <none>
                Manipulate: Laser Cannon
                Location:   {Sector 1} / No. 1 Reactor

 2-Faced
                LV: 18        XP:  100       Steal:  Phoenix Down
                HP: 330       AP:  10        Morph:  Hi-Potion
                MP: 80        Gil: 156       Leaves: Hi-Potion
                No Effect:  *Paralysis, Stop, Frog*
                No Effect:  Earth
                Ability:    Cure3, Self-destruct
                Manipulate: <cannot>
                Location:   Corel Prison / Basement
                Notes:      If a 2-Faced takes enough damage, it will
                            fall down.  If the white side faces up, it
                            will cast Cure3 on all members, then vanish.
                            If the red side comes up, it self-destructs.
                            Either way, you get no XP/AP/Gil from them.
                            Since this is the only action they can take,
                            they won't attack you if you don't attack
                            them.

                            This enemy can speak to you depending on what
                            you do to it (attack, steal, etc.)  The quotes
                            are as follows:

                            "Itai desuru-"
                             (That hurts)
                            "Ura~, itai yankee, ware~"
                             (Hey!  That hurts, bastard)

                             (Excuse me, stop that)

 Test 1 (?)
                Theoretically, since there are Test 0 and Test 2 enemies,
                a Test 1 monster should also exist.  However, I have no
                idea if it does or not.

                            This means he is very likely to use his
                            "Suicide Yang" attack.  However, if you
                            get the message, "Yang's happy," then
                            he is less likely to use this attack.
