	<div class="author">ZeaLitY</div>
	<div class="datetime">2018-05-07 05:18:41</div>
	<div class="body">Sorry for the hiatus, everyone (and huge apologies to my Peach Mountain Shoguns). Let&#039;s sum up everything that&#039;s happened since the last official mega-update. Since it&#039;ll take even longer to add remixes and doujins, those will be updated separately.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.chronocompendium.com/Forums/index.php?topic=12718.0" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/oP3TD3V.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="200" class="bbc_img resized" /></a><br /><br />The Chrono Compendium is hosting another <strong>Dream Splash</strong> contest, the first in nearly 6 years! These contests are a way for fans to create and share their wonderful art, music, fiction ... anything having to do with the Chrono series that YOU make. We encourage anyone and everyone to participate, so tell your friends and join us in keeping the dream alive! (Thanks to tushantin for the art!)<br /><br /><strong>[CHRONO BREAK]</strong>&nbsp; A Chrono fan named Mariela Gonzalez managed to contact Masato Kato on Facebook in 2015, publishing a retrospective on the series (that was later translated to French) with the interview. She asked about his original idea for Chrono Break; find the translated section <a href="https://www.chronocompendium.com/wiki/index.php/2015_-_Masato_Kato,_by_Mariela_Gonzalez" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">here</span></a>. Note that no other part of the interview has been translated, nor has an additional interview with Yasunori Mitsuda, and so the book has been placed on <a href="https://www.chronocompendium.com/wiki/index.php/Material_Requiring_Translation" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">Material Requiring Translation</span></a>. Long story short, and using a separate post from Kato&#039;s Facebook page, &quot;Chrono Reflect&quot; would&#039;ve encompassed Serge, Kid, and Janus saving the original Chrono Trigger crew shortly after the events of CT concluded (perhaps from the Fall of Guardia?) and would&#039;ve featured Crono, Lucca, and Frog returning as well.<br /><br /><strong>[HOWEVER]</strong>&nbsp; We&#039;re not sure if Kato&#039;s concept is the same as Takashi Tokita&#039;s planned Chrono Break game, which is probably how the trademark filing originated. Check out <a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/12/21/cancelled-chrono-trigger-sequel-lives-on-in-final-fantasy-game" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">this interview</span></a>, where he mentions that the concept carried over to Aemo&#039;s character and the balance of three starting characters seen in Final Fantasy Dimensions II. Boo the Gentleman Caller followed up and researched what the game was about. As taken from the FF wiki (our proud affiliate for over a decade at this point): &quot;The game follows a young man named Morrow and his companions as they travel through time and space in order to save the world from beings attacking the fabric of history.&quot; Per Boo, based on this, the game would have returned to time travel akin to Chrono Trigger, visiting different eras. More importantly, it would have revolved around the &quot;Chrono Break&quot; being the literal breaking of space-time by multiple aligned big bads attacking different points in space-time in unison. Check <a href="https://www.chronocompendium.com/Forums/index.php?topic=12614.0" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">this thread</span></a> for a further character run-down and speculation.<br /><br /><strong>[INTERVIEWS]</strong>&nbsp; Takashi Tokita revealed in 2016 that Tetsuya Nomura created the famous courthouse location art! Check out the interview <a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/themes/blogs/generic/post.aspx?WeblogApp=news&amp;y=2016&amp;m=06&amp;d=01&amp;WeblogPostName=chrono-trigger-director-would-love-to-see-new-version&amp;GroupKeys=&amp;utm_content=buffer15d7b" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">here</span></a>.&nbsp; <strong>[2]</strong>&nbsp; Hironobu Sakaguchi mentioned last year that FF7&#039;s development was halted so that virtually every resource at their disposal could work on finishing Chrono Trigger. Check it out <a href="https://www.polygon.com/a/final-fantasy-7" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">here</span></a>!&nbsp; <strong>[3]</strong>&nbsp; Next we have Takashi Tokita stating which ending of CT he thinks is canon (see the interview <a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/12/21/chrono-trigger-director-reveals-which-ending-he-thinks-is-cannon" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">here</span></a>. Spoiler—it&#039;s the one where the Epoch must be sacrificed to reach the Lavos core.&nbsp; <strong>[4]</strong>&nbsp; shmuplations completed a new round of very similar 1995 magazine interviews with the Chrono Trigger team; find it <a href="http://shmuplations.com/chronotrigger2" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">here</span></a>. Many, many thinks to him for this work!<br /><br /><strong>[MODIFICATION RELEASES]</strong>&nbsp; In case you missed it, Temporal Flux 3.04 is out! Grab it <a href="http://chronofan.com/Black/Other/tf304.7z" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">here</span></a>!&nbsp; <strong>[2]</strong>&nbsp; LethargicOwl has produced an addendum to Doctor L&#039;s re-retranslation of KWhazit&#039;s original Chrono Trigger retranslation, hoping to polish it further. Check out the patch notes <a href="https://www.romhacking.net/translations/3072/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">here</span></a>.&nbsp; <strong>[3]</strong>&nbsp; Right behind is <a href="https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/3891/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">Chrono Trigger Complete</span></a>, an effort by Kakera Sorcerer to create a complete experience with clarification of mistranslations, additional text from CT DS, and even some original lines taken from Chrono Compendium theory (such as referencing the Frozen Flame in Zeal).&nbsp; <strong>[4]</strong>&nbsp; From Chronospolit, we have the CT Bug Fix and Uncensoring Patch. This patch fixes several bugs and also restores censored dialogue from the Japanese original, as well as restoring things referenced by Chrono Cross that were not originally localized for the American release. Find it <a href="http://chronofan.com/Black/Other/CTBugfix.zip" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">here</span></a>.&nbsp; <strong>[5]</strong>&nbsp; Moving on from translations, we have The Fang&#039;s Chrono Trigger 1.01, a hack with several tweaks oriented for low-level gameplay. Check it out <a href="http://chronofan.com/Black/Other/ChronoTrigger101.7z" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">here</span></a> and hit the <a href="https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/3620/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">ROMHacking.net</span></a> page for full patch notes.&nbsp; <strong>[6]</strong>&nbsp; Notthisguy has provided a patch allowing one to start the game with Marle at Crono&#039;s house, bypassing Crono&#039;s first encounter; find it <a href="http://chronofan.com/Black/Other/Notthisguy_StartwithMarle.rar" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">here</span></a>.&nbsp; <strong>[7]</strong>&nbsp; Last but not least, we have three tweak patches from Laputan Machine, which eliminate the randomness of Reptite Cave treasure, tweak Johnny&#039;s race mechanics, or offer better prizes for completing the race. Find them <a href="http://chronofan.com/Black/Other/LaputanMachineFixes.zip" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">here</span></a>.&nbsp; <strong>[8]</strong>&nbsp; Okay, one more...thegreatBen released <a href="https://www.romhacking.net/reviews/3110/#review" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">Chrono Trigger +</span></a> unrelated to the Zakyrus project of the same name, restoring a lot of cut content; check out the readme for the full list!<br /><br /><strong>[CROSS MODIFICATION]</strong>&nbsp; nullpointer has uploaded the Chrono Cross 70-80% complete NTSC Disc One beta disc! This disc remarkably features working debug rooms, which were stripped out before the game went gold. The Compendium has picked up the dump for hosting on <a href="https://www.chronocompendium.com/wiki/index.php/Chrono_Cross_NTSC_Beta" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">this page</span></a>, and a research effort is underway at <a href="https://www.chronocompendium.com/Forums/index.php/topic,9733.0.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">this thread</span></a>, with some action items just waiting to be explored. Many, many thinks to nullpointer for releasing this!!&nbsp; <strong>[2]</strong>&nbsp; utunnels got pretty far on dumping Chrono Cross models into his viewer utility. Check out the full list <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/utunnels1.appspot.com/ccmodelviewer/list.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">here</span></a>. Enjoy seeing several Chrono Cross characters and enemies like you&#039;ve never seen before!&nbsp; <strong>[3]</strong>&nbsp; It&#039;s worth noting that the model viewer has given us basically our only true good look at Tia; check it out <a href="https://www.chronocompendium.com/images/wiki/4/4d/Tia_Model.png" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">here</span></a>.&nbsp; <strong>[4]</strong>&nbsp; Danetta has authorized linking the Chrono Cross Single Disc project, which avoids the need to change discs when playing Chrono Cross on an emulator. Check it out <a href="https://www.chronocompendium.com/wiki/index.php/Chrono_Cross_Modifications_and_Translations" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">here</span></a>!<br /><br /><strong>[FLUX PLUGINS]</strong>&nbsp; Mauron and others have been busy creating Temporal Flux plugins capable of an incredible range of Chrono Trigger modification!&nbsp; <strong>[1]</strong>&nbsp; Hi-Tech is Mauron&#039;s flagship tech editor; grab it <a href="http://chronofan.com/Black/Other/HiTechBeta26.zip" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">here</span></a>.&nbsp; <strong>[2]</strong>&nbsp; A bevy of others are <a href="http://chronofan.com/Black/Other/MauronsToolsMay18.zip" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">this zip file!</span></a> they include: Fiendcrafter, An enemy stat and appearance editor; Inventory Manager: A shop editor; Itemizer: Item and equipment editor; NPCustom: NPC graphics data editor; Save Master: A plugin to control the data copied into save files; String Relabeler: A plugin that allows editing of some of Temporal Flux&#039;s global strings; and Warrior Workshop: A character stat editor. Thank goodness, no more using Crone!<br /><br /><strong>[CHRONO TRIGGER]</strong>&nbsp; someguy339 recovered an amazing piece of lost CuteLucca fan art; see it <a href="https://www.chronocompendium.com/images/wiki/1/1d/Cutelucca_Schala.jpg" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">here</span></a>!&nbsp; <strong>[2]</strong>&nbsp; Xouman has released soundfonts for Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross, and other games; find them <a href="http://chronofan.com/Black/Other/Xouman_Soundfonts.rar" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">here</span></a>.&nbsp; <strong>[3]</strong>&nbsp; If you&#039;re into speedrunning, check out <a href="http://bs1.wikidot.com/hack" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">this page</span></a>, hosting practice run and textless hacks for Chrono Trigger. The hacks have been mirrored at the Compendium. Good luck!&nbsp; <strong>[4]</strong>&nbsp; Scintillating_Void provided a great write-up on Lavos in the tradition of H.P. Lovecraft, which is now our newest feature! Check it out <a href="https://www.chronocompendium.com/Forums/index.php?topic=12523.0" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">here</span></a>.<br /><br /><strong>[CHRONO CROSS]</strong>&nbsp; Lina Takezawa, a Japanese user, graciously stopped by to try and help us with the Chronopolis battle text romaji. Check out her translation as juxtaposed with XABY&#039;s old attempt <a href="https://www.chronocompendium.com/wiki/index.php/Chronopolis#Battle_Area_Banner_Text" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">here</span></a>.&nbsp; <strong>[2]</strong>&nbsp; utunnels made an awesome topic comparing characters&#039; listed heights to their height as measured with his model viewer utility; check out the surprising results <a href="https://www.chronocompendium.com/Forums/index.php?topic=12478.0" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">here</span></a>!&nbsp; <strong>[3]</strong>&nbsp; The rules for each card of the Chrono Cross Bandai Card Game have been translated <a href="https://www.chronocompendium.com/wiki/index.php/Chrono_Cross_Bandai_Card_Game#Chrono_Cross" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">here</span></a>. We still need the name card translated, however (check <a href="https://www.chronocompendium.com/wiki/index.php/Material_Requiring_Translation" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">here</span></a>).&nbsp; <strong>[4]</strong>&nbsp; Masato Kato released a storyboard of a cut FMV on his Facebook showing Harle leaving Serge at Chronopolis when the Dragon God formed. This rather settles the fact that Harle, too, merged into the Dragon God, which was previously not explicitly shown. Find it <a href="https://www.chronocompendium.com/images/wiki/8/84/Cut_Chronopolis_Harle_FMV.jpg" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">here</span></a>.<br /><br /><strong>[DREAMERS AND ECHOES]</strong>&nbsp; Crimson Echoes peripheral content has been restored to <a href="https://www.chronocompendium.com/wiki/index.php/Chrono_Trigger:_Crimson_Echoes" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">this page</span></a>, including all the art done for release, beta screenshots, the CE Memorial soundtrack, and several interviews. This was originally hosted on crimsonechoes.com, and now is coming home to the Compendium.&nbsp; <strong>[2]</strong>&nbsp; Masato Kato released his character art for Serge and Kid (Radical Dreamers) on Facebook; check it out <a href="https://www.chronocompendium.com/images/wiki/d/d0/Kato_Serge_Kid_Sketch.jpg" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">here</span></a>!&nbsp; <strong>[3]</strong>&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s being worked on any longer, but it&#039;s always worth checking out utunnels&#039; web version of <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/utunnels1.appspot.com/rdweb/index.htm#en_US" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">Radical Dreamers</span></a>.

As the site and its efforts are still ongoing, the Compendium has not picked up the patches to host here, but has added a link to their page on the Modification encyclopedia page (and has backed up all items to date).<br /><br /><strong>[COMPENDIUM]</strong>&nbsp; We now have a Discord thanks to V_Translanka; check it out <a href="https://discord.gg/FXpBw7T" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">here</span></a>.&nbsp; <strong>[2]</strong>&nbsp; Rounding out the update, we&#039;re announcing a new Guru court! Guru of Reason will be Mauron, who has been a constant, steady presence over the last several years, quietly working on and expanding Chrono Trigger hacking knowledge and serving as a linchpin of the surviving modification community, along with several others. Guru of Time will be shared by Danetta and Prizvel, who have made countless invaluable contributions to Chrono Cross modification, and have taken time frequently on the forums to help new Chrono Cross hackers find their footing. Lastly, Guru of Life will be Boo the Gentleman Caller, whose community-focused efforts and threads have kept a sense of Compendiumite spirit going, when we&#039;d all assumed a quiet death would ensue a few years back. The Dream Splash is going and life is good! Congratulations to everyone.</div>

	<div class="body">All right folks, it&#039;s time to throw on your &quot;walk through walls&quot; code and party like it&#039;s 1999! Check out this awesome episode of &quot;Boundary Break,&quot; a YouTube series that delves into obscure secrets of game design as revealed by the camera&#039;s roving eye. In this episode Shesez and team explore some ingenious things the Chrono Trigger programmers did, from object pre-loading, to hidden event triggers, to hiding lots of down-and-dirty graphics work with layering. Whether you&#039;re a rank-and-file Chrono fan or a veteran member of the Chrono modding community, give this a gander -- you&#039;re sure to appreciate it, and you may even learn a thing or two!<br /><br /><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/2Ja3TdujlDg?list=PLYfhW_P-MkU7vBmWwwyqdIWNDzXfEZwnO" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">View Boundary Break Episode 51</a></strong><br /><br />Special props go to Compendium member <strong>utunnels,</strong> whose Chrono Cross model viewer gets a shout-out toward the end of the episode.

There have been no rumors of a new game, and the cease &amp; desist order, combined with the march of time, has gutted the community; activity is at an all-time low at the Compendium. In light of these developments, the Compendium has elected to restore the modification encyclopedia and Kajar Laboratories forums. Though everything was crippled by that sad turn of events, perhaps something can continue now. Fan projects will still <em>not</em> be hosted—please don&#039;t submit story hacks or projects here.

	<h2 class="subject">Chrono Cuts music CD commencing!</h2>
	<div class="author">Jazz Paladin</div>
	<div class="datetime">2016-06-20 20:02:57</div>
	<div class="body">As I wrap up my latest production (Jazzyvania : Symphonies of the Knight), I can now officially say that I am ready to move on to my next production.<br /><br />I am officially dubbing this project &quot;Chrono Cuts&quot;. At this moment, I am envisioning this to be the largest production that I have ever worked on, and as such, I am quite giddy.<br /><br />In summary I expect this to be around 80 songs from Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross. Although I had originally estimated a release year of 2017, this may end up being 2018 depending on the circumstances, as this is quite a huge undertaking given my preference to use real instruments as opposed to samples as much as I can.<br /><br />Ideally speaking, I would like for this to be released on CD as well as the more modern digital formats. However, this does mean rather steep licensing costs, which I anticipate to be an excess of $10,000 USD if I am successful. Rather than clogging this message with the messy details of production, I will just leave this particular aspect contained to the following link, where you can look at a more comprehensive explanation if so desired :<br /><br /><a href="http://www.jazzpaladin.com/?p=100" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.jazzpaladin.com/?p=100</a><br /><br />Alternatively, I may just release the music in small digital waves (Chrono Cuts volume 1, 2, etc...) as a means of funding the CD&#039;s gradually. I am undecided in the meantime as to whether or not the CD&#039;s are even a viable option for me, as much as I would like to be able to produce these. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I absolutely love the idea hiring an artist to produce a full-scale art book or some such thing, but the costs are indeed very inhibiting. <br /><br />I am not a fan of Kickstarters for my own work (see notes in above link for a detailed explanation), but if you want an idea of what this project may sound like when completed, I highly recommend you check out my previous Chrono recordings on avenues such as iTunes, Spotify, Amazon, or even consider checking out the CD (First Journey : Video Game Grooves) that they derive from. <br /><br />Jazz Paladin -- Corridors of Time<br />Jazz Paladin -- Schala&#039;s Theme<br />Jazz Paladin -- Gato&#039;s Song<br /><br />Here we go! Wish me luck!</div>

	<div class="body">This version includes the deleted from the official release debug room. Since the original script of the room was only in Japanese, the script had to be rewritten from scratch, using the remnants of debug code from other rooms. Also in the room added other capabilities: view the endings of the game, listening to game music, video, add any item or element. (idea borrowed from the ps version of Chrono Trigger, where such functions were in the system file). As well as in Chrono trigger, these options are available only after beating the game. To control for the passage, to the NPC in time warp added a custom dialog that tells the percent of the game. When the percentage is equal to 100, the NPC will offer to be in the debug room.<br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B2xNMW7TdGFfZ2w5YXlIMDlvcFk&amp;usp=sharing" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B2xNMW7TdGFfZ2w5YXlIMDlvcFk&amp;usp=sharing</a></div>
