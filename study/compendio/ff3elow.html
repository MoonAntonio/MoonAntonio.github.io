			buried deep beneath the earth. The evil elements of the earth, which 
			had been kept down until then, came to life, and humanity was thrown

			here was relatively slight. Most of the people were convinced that 
			the wind crystal must be living in the underworld and protecting them...and 
			they were right. One day the wind crystal arose from the underworld 
			and chose four youths to find the remaining three crystals that would 
			save the world. Off on their journey, the youths ventured forth; and, 
			as a soft breeze whistled gently through the trees, the group of four 
			strained their ears to hear hopes, dreams, desires. The wind spoke 
			of all, and the four valiant youths listened sympathetically to the 
			wind, believing that in return, the wind crystal would shower them 
			with light again.</td>
