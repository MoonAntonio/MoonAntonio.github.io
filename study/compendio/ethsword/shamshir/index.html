  <P><I>Shamshir,</I> which means &quot;curved like the tiger's
  nail&quot;, describes the deeply curved and continuously tapering
  parabolic saber blade typical of Persia (Iran), Mughal India
  and the adjoining Arab world from the middle of the 16th century.
  In this essay, the practice of Haider (1991) will be followed
  and sabers with blades of this form will be classified as <I>shamshirs</I>,
  regardless of whether the hilt is of Persian, Indo-Muslim or
  Arab form; in contrast with the more usually encountered practice
  of classifying such blades hilted in Indo-Muslim style as <I>talwars</I>.
  (Haider reserves the term <I>talwar</I> for other curved swords
  of varying forms generally hilted in Indo-Muslim style, with
  blades usually wider than a <I>shamshir</I>, often not tapering
  uniformly and often including a <I>ricasso</I> or unsharpened
  area adjacent to the hilt, while Pant applies <I>talwar</I> generally
  to include sabers with an Indo-Muslim hilt such as example #3
  below.) Considering that blades of <I>shamshir</I> form, of both
  Persian and Indian manufacture, were widely traded and interchangeably
  used with hilts of local manufacture throughout the Near-Eastern
  Islamic world from shortly after their initial adoption by the
  Persians until use of the sword declined in the 20th Century,
  Haider's approach seems justified.</P>

      rehoned <I>shamshir</I> of Persian form, likely 18th or 19th
      century. The blade is made of <I>wootz</I> or &quot;true Damascus&quot;
      steel, with a fine pattern only very focally visible on a blade
      which shows evidence of having been bent and restraightened.
      The guard assembly and pommel cap are made of bronze, over which,
      very focally, remains of gilding can be discerned. The grip consists
      of two blocks of yellowed ivory which have a rounded square cross
      section in the area by the guard which includes the reflection
      of the langets and increased thickness beyond this towards the
      pommel cap. Gilded bronze strips, not visible in the photographs,
      cover the interval between the ivory hemi-grips where the tang
      lies. The sword was reputedly brought from Saudi Arabia by an
      oil field worker. Overall length: 95 cm. (37.2 inches); blade
      length: 81 cm. (31.8 inches).</FONT></CENTER></TD>

  <P>Contemporary illustrations most often show these swords being
  worn within scabbards, suspended horizontally to diagonally and
  edge down, at the wearer's left side. Though the deeply curved
  blades are clearly adapted for the draw cut at considerable expense
  to the potential for thrusting use, these swords are known to
  have been carried by dismounted as well as mounted warriors.
  <I>Shamshirs</I> are usually regarded as being optimized for
  mounted combat at close quarters and such use is supported by
  period illustrations and writings. Rawson, interestingly, opines
  that these sabers may well have been adopted more as a hunting
  weapon for the &quot;elegant slaughter of animals from horseback&quot;
  than as a combat weapon.</P>

      is made of iron, over which remains of gilding can be discerned.

  <P>These deeply curved blades tend to reach their maximum degree
  of curvature some 50 to 60% of the blade length from the crossguard.
  The blade is widest where it joins the hilt, from where it tapers,
  both in width and in thickness, towards the tip, with the degree
  of taper being greatest distally. The faces of blades in good
  condition tend to be flat, but subtly roll (become convex) towards
  the edge and the spine. The spine will usually be slightly rounded
  (again convex). Indian blades may show a ricasso (or <I>khajana</I>)
  which is a length of unsharpened blade at the root adjacent to
  the tang and a feature far more commonly associated with blades
  of <I>talwar</I> rather than <I>shamshir</I> form. <I>Shamshir</I>
  blades are usually formed of <I>wootz</I> or &quot;true Damascus&quot;
  steel which is considered in detail in <A HREF="../pat05.html"

      'Abbas of the Safavid dynasty (1588 - 1629 AD) and the lifetime

  <P><I>Shamshir</I> blades will often include one or more of the
  following inscriptions: the maker's name, the owner's name, a
  dedication to a ruler, quotations from the Koran and talismanic
  devices. The most celebrated swordsmith to create <I>shamshirs</I>,
  Assadullah (or: Asad Allah, Asad Ullah, Asadullah) of Isfahan,
  worked during the high renaissance of the Safavid Persian Empire
  in the time of Shah 'Abbas, who reigned between 1588 and 1629
  A.D. Essentially no actual details of Assadullah's life are known.
  Inscriptions proclaiming blades to be his work are common and
  vary greatly in position of inscription placement, technique
  and style of execution, wording and calligraphy. Mayer notes
  inscribed dates associated with Assadullah range from 811 AH
  to 1808 AD and Elgood reports a <I>wootz</I> blade also inscribed
  as the work of Assadullah but dated 1921 A.D. - a span of about
  500 years! Another famed swordsmith from this same time and place
  was Assadullah's son Kalb 'Ali (or: Quli Ali) for whom an equally
  variable and large number of inscriptions have also been documented.
  From the large numbers of blades so inscribed and from the variations
  in style, it becomes obvious that these blades cannot be solely
  the work of the named swordsmith or even of a particular workshop.
  Considering the variation in the inscribed dates and rulers it
  seems unlikely that these inscriptions were truly made to deceive
  contemporary buyers, hence these inscriptions may essentially
  have been intended as talismanic devices. Exactly which of the
  blades bearing the signatures of these and other celebrated smiths
  are actually the work of these smiths is likely now entirely
  unknowable. Rawson advises assessment of the worthiness of a
  blade to bear the mark of a great swordsmith, however this does
  not allow definite attribution of authorship. On the basis of
  a broad heavy blade bearing a bold, complex <I>wootz</I> pattern,
  Figel attributed a few of the swords in his collection to Assadullah,
  as inscribed, however the cataloger of his collection at the
  time of auction was understandably more cautious.</P>

      a typical Indo-Muslim hilt of <I>Delhishahi</I> form, likely
      18th century. Many authorities would classify this as a <I>talwar</I>
      based upon this hilt, which is of iron covered by a thick layer
      of yellow gold. A false ricasso in the form of two plates with
      an embossed and gilded intertwined floral pattern may be seen
      behind the langets covering the root of the blade. The blade
      is of <I>wootz</I> steel and bears a gold inlaid Arabic inscription
      on its spine, likely a religious invocation or prayer. A cartouche
      with inscription made as a series of small punched marks is present

  <P>Hilts, while exhibiting a multitude of local variations of
  form and greatly variable styles of decoration, do retain a core
  of common features. The quillions (crossguard tips) may exhibit
  a number of styles: moderate length with rounded button like
  terminals in the classical Persian style (see #1 and #2 above),
  stubby and bulbous in Indo-Muslim varieties (as with #3 above)
  and longer and more drawn out in Arab and Turkish examples (see
  #4 below). The quillions arise from a centrally thickened and
  convex crossguard assembly from which integral langets also almost
  universally arise and extend towards the blade's tip. The langets
  vary in bulk, often being more delicate on Persian influenced
  examples and more robust on Indian types. Aside from their obvious
  assistance in seating the sword in its scabbard, some authors
  posit a role for the langets as sword catchers or breakers in
  combat, but such a role seems unlikely for those more delicate
  hilts crafted of softer metals. A metallic grip is integral to
  the crossguard assembly in the typical Indo-Muslim hilt, however
  in the more Persian influenced varieties a symmetric reflection
  of the langet extends into an inletted area on the grip, which
  may be formed of two cheeks or blocks of material such as ivory,
  bone or horn which are riveted into place. Indo-Muslim hilts
  may rely entirely upon adhesives for attachment to the tang,
  while in Persian examples the crossguard assembly will be secured
  by adhesives and the attachment of the grips supplemented by
  rivets. While tangs may extend the length of the hilt, they are
  also often shorter. The wire wrapping over the portion of the
  grip adjacent to the crossguard, seen most frequently on Arab
  variants, but not entirely lacking in Indian contexts, most likely
  originated as a reinforcement of an area of the hilt most likely
  to experience early failure. In swords of classical Persian form,
  beyond the width of a single hand, the grip turns at roughly
  a right angle to the axis of the hilt in the direction of the
  edge. This short extension is covered with a pommel cap, usually
  decorated in or complementary to the style of the crossguard
  assembly. The angle and length of this pommel may vary such as
  with the longer pommel cap arising at a more acute angle on the
  likely Syrian Arab example (#4 below) or in the form of a bulbous
  expansion on Turkish examples. In some Indian examples, a knuckle
  bow will arise from the quillion on the edge side and extend
  back towards the pommel; a similar function may be served by
  a chain with Arab styles. The hilt may terminate as a beast's
  head on more luxurious examples, and such luxurious examples
  may adopt unique forms beyond the scope of this discussion of
  the basic characteristics of working grade weapons.</P>

      <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1">Example 4. A <I>shamshir</I> or Arab
      <I>saif</I> of Syrian style, the mountings likely 19th century;
      the blade possibly earlier. The blade is made of <I>wootz</I>
      or &quot;true Damascus&quot; steel, with a bold moderately complex
      pattern and has a gold inlaid inscription illustrated above as
      <B>c</B>. The quillon block and pommel cap are made of hallmarked
      silver engraved with foliage. The grip is of horn, thicker overall
      than the width shown in the picture. Four silver strips opposite
      from and at right angles to one another cover much of the grip
      and the areas of exposed dark brown horn show small silver and
      brass inlays. The end of the grip turns at an acute angle toward
      the edge to form the pommel. A tear shaped silver dangle is attached
      to the tip of the pommel cap by a loop. The scabbard of this
      example is of the Turkish fashion in that the scabbard is slit
      from the mouth along the spine side for about 12.5 cm. (5 inches)
      to allow the sharply curved blade to be withdrawn. Overall length:
      91 cm. (35.7 inches); blade length: 76.5 cm. (30 inches).</FONT></CENTER></TD>
    </TR>
  </TABLE></CENTER></P>
  <P>While the curve of the blade is largely parabolic, the limb
  of the curve terminating in the hilt is a few inches longer and
  the blade straightens as the hilt is approached. This asymmetry
  presents a challenge for the scabbard maker. Persian and Indian
  scabbard mouths are somewhat wider than their blade; the blades
  at their widest being 70 to 75% of the inside width dimension
  of the scabbard mouth. When first inserted, the spine of the
  blade will glide smoothly along the back edge of the scabbard,
  however, once the blade is three quarters inserted, the cutting
  edge will begin to shift toward the opposite side of the scabbard
  mouth. Turkish scabbards and some Arab scabbards are narrower,
  employing a slot extending from the spine end of the scabbard
  mouth for short distance to deal with the asymmetry. Some of
  these scabbards will even feature a rain guard to cover the otherwise
  exposed area when the blade is fully inserted. The lining of
  <I>shamshir</I> scabbards is often of wood and the covering may
  be of leather, velvet, metal or a combination thereof.</P>
